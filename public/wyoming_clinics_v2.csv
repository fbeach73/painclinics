It remains superb, and I can spend a lot of space detailing the fine experiences and results of their work.  Suffice it to state that I recommend them to anyone needing Premier's expertise.\n\nIt's the paperwork/administration that needs some attention.  Of the many health care providers that I visit (and those my wife and son with a disability attend as well), it is the ONLY one that requires patients to complete pages of paperwork just about every time one visits.  Other places will give me the information it has on file and ask me to update, but not Premier.  It is particularly difficult for me to complete the 4-5 pages of forms because I have developed very shaky handwriting as I have aged.  And despite all of the paperwork that I have completed, Premier asks me to do it again at my next appointment, even if it is just a few months from my previous visit. And even worse, some of the little information that is already on these pages of forms is incorrect.  The employment and contact information on the forms I completed last week were a decade out of date even though I had updated all of that several times previously.  None of the surgeries that Premier has performed over thirty years were reflected on the forms I had to complete even though I had listed all of them several times in the past, and besides, that information should already be in THEIR files.  Even my knee replacement surgery from seven months ago, the follow-up office visit a month later and the physical therapy at Premier that concluded just five months ago wasn't reflected on the forms.  Common, Premier.  You have a top-notch operation; you can do a whole lot better with your patients when it comes to the paperwork."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""3 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-09-21T15:18:25"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thanks for taking the time to share your positive experience.

I work 50-60 hours a week doing multiple jobs and also a mother of two small children. I'm always wiggling my neck and back trying to find comfort when discomfort just seems to be part of the package of my life right now. Seeking help for my discomfort was not on my to do list. The Health Source team came to my work and I took advantage of the free 15 min massage from Beth that they were offering that day. WOW, LIFE CHANGER. I scheduled a consultation without hesitation. I was not really sure I'd need anything but it wouldn't hurt to check it out. It turns out that I really did need major attention on my neck. My constant squirming and pain wasn't normal like I thought it was and a 20 year old injury had caused major damage and improper regrowth. Dr. Jonathon has changed my life. I have a big health plan in front of me that I can not wait to start. He was very upfront of the cost and healing time this will take. In the mean time until I can start my big health plan to fix my neck, I have been getting adjustments. The chiropractic adjustments have already given me soooo much daily relief. Relief that I didn't know I could get, relief from pain that I just thought was part of my young motherhood and constant working. The staff at the front desk are absolute gems. They are the nicest, calmest, most professional staff I've ever experienced in Riverton. This place is truly an asset to our town. Dr. Jonathon and his entire staff is 10/10 all the way. I will tell everyone to go there, seek help even if you think nothing can help you. Side note: my 6 year old son comes with me to my appointments and he doesn't want to leave. Their kid corner is his favorite and he gets so excited to come with his mama to her doc appointment."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""10 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-02-05T18:50:06"",""response_from_owner_text"":""We're so grateful for your 5-star review.

They also wouldn't communicate with insurance when they requested a preauthorization and they would speak with the pharmacist who was trying to help us rectify the situation at hand. Also since there is no corporate or headquarters number there was no way to reach out to escalatenthe situation.

He's blunt and to the point, but most importantly - he KNOWS what he is doing. He shows he cares by TREATING you, which is worth far more to me than any words.\n\nI injured my back in my mid 20s, in the Army, and suffered crippling sciatic pain well into my 30s. MRI and Nerve conduction studies confirmed an issue, but SEVEN specialists were unable to find the underlying cause. Most offices wanted to prescribe medication, not treat the underlying issue.\n\nI drove up from Casper to meet with Dr. Mansell and we discussed in person. He suggested a treatment approach that I had not considered and convinced me to give it a try - I was skeptical, but willing to try anything out of desperation. Prior to treatment, I couldn't lay on my back, wear a belt, lift anything heavy, or wear anything but the loosest sweatpants. This was my life for nearly SEVEN years.\n\nIn the months since I first worked with Dr. Mansell, I have  nearly returned to my prior fitness level. Even more than that, I can SLEEP through the night again.\n\nGive him a chance to work with you. I was limping through life, wondering how I could possibly be a good dad to my children when I couldn't even get a good night's rest.\n\nWorking with Dr. Mansell changed my life. If you're ready to give up after bouncing from office to office, GIVE HIM A CHANCE.\n\nI can't articulate just how grateful I am.

Their website states that the radiologist's report is included in the cost of an MRI, yet I was blindsided with an extra fee. I called three times before my appointment, and not once was this additional charge mentioned. It wasn't until I arrived that I was told my MRI would be read by a radiologist in Idaho and that I'd have to pay more. This lack of transparency is misleading and unethical.\n\nTo make matters worse, obtaining my own medical records was an unnecessary struggle. They refused to send me my report, insisting that I come in to sign for it. Yet, in the same conversation, they admitted they could have emailed me the records release form. If they could email the request, why couldn't they email the records--especially when they already had my email on file from my visit? It felt like they were intentionally making the process difficult. The poor communication and lack of patient consideration are unacceptable. I've never had this kind of issue with any other healthcare facility, and I will be reporting my experience to the Wyoming Healthcare Licensing Office.
