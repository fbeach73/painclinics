Commonwealth Pain & Spine is different from comparable pain management clinics in treating patients. The team avoids the standard surgery-first delivery model in favor of a less invasive, more cost-efficient model. Because each physician recognizes how exhausting chronic pain feels, they make it a point to empathize with the needs of their patients.

This morning, my brother, who is disabled and can not drive, had an appointment with Stephanie Simon. When he arrived at the clinic, he was checked in, then after the 20 minute wait, he inquired as to what the hold up was and they told him that the doctor wouldn't be there until 9:00 (his appointment was at 8:00). He asked the staff why he was rescheduled three times and then they still didn't coordinate his appointment with the doctor's schedule. *He can not drive and has to rely on a ride service, which has to be rescheduled every time there is a mix up like this.  He was told that they had no control over the scheduling. So, he went back and waited nearly an hour before Dr. Rafal Krejza came into the room and told him that he was not welcome at the clinic because he was rude to the staff.  He explained to the doctor that he only explained that he relied on ride shares and had to reschedule his ride more than once and why can't they coordinate the schedule with the appointments.  My brother has been a patient at this clinic for years and has never seen this doctor before.

First, this clinic is a five star clinic. I was in Nebraska from out of town dealing with extremely stressful times and in that process my back went completely out.I couldn't walk without severe lower back pain. I went to the Bellevue Medical Center ER and the PA there recommended this clinic. Justin was the first person I spoke with. He was the one who got me in the door! Wonderful to talk to, reassured me and was so compassionate and caring. Right away, Dr. Kurt took me back and immediately assessed me. He worked on me to provide immediate relief so I could actually sleep that night. And he did. I actually cried from the relief he provided that first evening. I proceeded to go to the clinic each day for the next seven days. Each morning I saw Dr. Hanson who gently and very professionally worked on my back to gradually get me to a point to where I could make the trip to drive back to Oregon. I also saw the NP Stacey who gave me trigger anti inflammatory injections. Izzy, Haley and the other staff were all so nice and welcoming each day I arrived. To sum my experience up, I can only state that everyone I came in contact with in the urgent care and clinic were professional, welcoming, compassionate, supportive, knowledgable, caring, down to earth good people. There is NO way I could have had the successful outcome that I had without this team. Highly recommend. You will receive high quality, amazing care here.

I am absolutely struck by the way I move and feel like me again  truly thought I would have to live with the pain not moving my neck all the way or bending without pain.

I went with my adult daughter for her appointment. Her first appointment at Envision was with Michelle. She thought she was seeing her again. Not so. As we were waiting for the someone to come into the exam room for the appointment we both heard a voice. After looking for the source of the voice we saw a face on a screen. It was Megan Scarborough even though she didn't introduce herself that we can remember. We were shocked to be talking to a screen rather than someone in person. Shame on Envision for not letting her know this would be a Zoom call. My daughter was in tremendous pain and in tears. But Megan seemed to think, rather than asking her how she was feeling, that it was a good time to scold her for overtaking her pain meds. She couldn't have been more condescending and arrogant if she tried. She even felt it was appropriate to verbally pat Michelle on the head for her efforts with my daughter's RX and then tell us about her own medical prowess and methods. Meanwhile, she just would not (or maybe she couldn't) stop talking. My daughter was trying to explain how one particular Rx didn't help but Megan couldn't be quite long enough to hear her. It was a total debacle of a visit. The \""meeting\"" ended with me yelling at the screen, 3 times, that that med didn't work. Megan was talking the whole time. Again, Megan couldn't manage to make herself stop talking to actually hear from the patient or me. Megan did state that we appeared to be frustrated and not listening to her! It appears she had a blinding flash of the obvious! We couldn't get out of there and away from her fast enough. She is in the wrong business if she thinks that shaming someone in pain, while in tears, is a good idea. Her bedside manner was totally absent as was her caring about the patient who was in obvious pain. She talked to my daughter like she was a druggie looking for her next hit. We will not grace that doorstep again. She was the worst provider I have ever come across in my life. Compassion, understanding, and listening were just not even remotely in her doctor's bag. Again, she.was.the.worst! I've seen STOP signs with more compassion."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-12-08T15:32:03"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMej66wHpigV_1m0yypHjllduuSnb1a5aiTrw5Ol4ow5XH=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":5,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2psdVFtTnBjRmxqYjFGSGIyWXlkbXBYYUZkMVZrRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2psdVFtTnBjRmxqYjFGSGIyWXlkbXBYYUZkMVZrRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xf49727327fb7939a!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOjluQmNpcFljb1FHb2YydmpXaFd1VkE%7C0dCF1E2wVgP%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Melissa Hicks"",""reviewer_id"":""113092973854635708804"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113092973854635708804?hl=en-US"",""rating"":3,""review_text"":""I haven't been going here long, ive had 2 appointments so far.

The back injection for the L4-L5 I read previously was a dreaded experience for some, but mine was better than the best. I LITERALLY felt a teeny pinch and a couple nerve \""zaps\"" (Dr let me know he's in the right spot, we both laughed during the procedure) I DID NOT FEEL the needle travel to the nerve site AT ALL.

How IN THE UNIVERSE could people dread THAT injection when I've suffered a great deal of pain worse from a paper cut! I think many people hype this injection up because it's performed under Xray and they have to ensure they place the medication in EXACTLY the correct position. While many others believe this procedure was the \"" worst experience of my life, I had just the opposite!

There have been many times I have felt the need to leave a review but never have the time, but today I made the time.\nI would recommend this clinic to anybody out there who wants a possitive outcome and multi level pain management approach, that provides a clean,  stable, knowlegable , safe, and professional pain management.\nI have to say not every clinic is perfect but reading the very few the less than perfect reviews here should be taken with a grain of salt because we have to take into consideration that people in pain (personally speaking  here)  are hard to deal with and desperate to keep their pain levels down or at bay,  might be more critical.  But reviews coming  from patients who were late for appointments who had to reschedule or medication problems, or dismissed for whatever reason, in my opinion and experience with MD pain,  it is more to do with the patient, than the staff or this establishment. They run a tight ship.  They are organized. Be ontime for your appts. ( 20 minutes early) Follow your Dr.s advice and procedures, take your prescription as advised. Have good communication  (because they do here) and if all of these boxes check off for you, I promise, you will do fine here and actually get the pain management you deserve, because life is no fun for those of us in pain.  Sometimes a person would do anything to  make it go away for even just a minute, but on those desperate high pain level days try to remember, we are all human here.  A little patients and civility goes a long way, and like I mentioned, I would take poor reviews with a grain of salt on ANY platform, I guess but especially here because speaking from experience, (I can be that wing-nut, unorganized,  running late, problem patient with horrible ADD) I have covered every scenario possible with this clinic in yhe time I have gone here, and the only time I had any issue was the time when **I** was the cause of the issue.\nLove both locations, but the Springs location being smaller and more convenient for me is where I will make my appts from here on. ( I hope) Dr Bernardini is brilliant , Charmin, and now I see Meghan but from what I have heard about the others, is that they're all awesome\n\nGood luck to you all on your pain journey and I hope you find some relief out there no matter who you choose to help you."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-12-09T22:36:33"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLxG-T7eRlEjICw5a6ou--F-PwlLT0AYkdckDzkgC3XHZ61yuo=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":7,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tjeWJFaHZibE0yU2tkZlVFbFBUSFJaYVdoaE1rRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tjeWJFaHZibE0yU2tkZlVFbFBUSFJaYVdoaE1rRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bc8bd19b7f8a328!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOkcybEhvblM2SkdfUElPTHRZaWhhMkE%7C0cxe5YoYM7h%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Noam Paoletti"",""reviewer_id"":""112921643968281873827"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112921643968281873827?hl=en-US"",""rating"":2,""review_text"":""My experience with the doctor was fine, but the office policy makes it impossible to get adequate care.

They agreed but they would only send in a 3 day bridge due to doctor not being in office he was on vacation  but they only sent in 2 days I tried to get it corrected but they refused and they messed up on pick up date and fused to correct that I told them I would go through withdrawl and they said they couldn't do anything about it but would send in nausea medicine for withdrawl which does not help with withdrawl only something like clonidine or Ativan can help.  I told them that with my health it could be dangerous for me to go through withdrawal and I could end up in ER and at worse it could be life threatening.  They still did not care. I have since found out it is unlawful to force a patient into forcing abruptly stopping or forced tapering. Then after this I went to one of my schedule appointments and was told if I wanted to continue as  a patient I would have to take down my negative review since I felt I had no choice I did.  Again they had no right to tell me to do so.  After I had been with them for a few months I had a appointment 7 days before my prescription was due to be filled and they told me to call to get a bridge. I called and due to all the doctors being off or on vacation there was only one doctor working that day.  I was told the doctor was to busy with patients and would not be able to write a bridge for me because they wouldn't have time I said this was wrong and after talking for a while trying to make sure my prescription was filled and still being told they might not fill it I said this was patient harm and prejudice after being told they can at anytime decide not to write prescription it was at their discretion and they had already refused to write one for another patient earlier just because she said who she was a PA that they base there discretion on the patients who are trouble patients. I again said this is patient prejudice and they could open themselves to a malpractice suit,  not saying I would at the time.   But after all this they called me 30 minutes later saying they were dropping me to non compliance and would give me a 30 day prescription. There reason on non compliance was I didn't do my UA which was not true I did it later because when I went in for my appointment I had a blinding migraine and forgot to do it but I came back later and did it they said everything was fine and let me take my UA and not to worry the doctor said it was fine due to the fact it was honest mistake. I'm writing this to let everyone know it is against the law to abruptly force patient off there opiates or to force them to taper when they have valid pain and are not abusing there medication they did this to me by not filling my prescription on day it was due putting my health in danger and they admitted to me that they do this to many of their patients.  You can get a patient advocate to help you if this has happen to you. You can refer your provider to CDC force tapering or forced abrupt discontinued medication. If nessary go to your state medical board or seek legal advocacy support. The other thing they did was release medical information about me to another pain clinic without my permission. I have text from the other clinic as proof and I do plan on getting legal advocate what this clinic is doing to patients is wrong."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-07-04T05:35:11"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5QNMW8LLq7onYy1G4H70NDH4FgMtcfXAYNPjTvCj2ogoFgCZ-=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":6,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21wSVZXaENNVkF4YzFGR1FUSjBWSFpYY2s5WVpYYxAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21wSVZXaENNVkF4YzFGR1FUSjBWSFpYY2s5WVpYYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bc8bd19b7f8a328!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmpIVWhCMVAxc1FGQTJ0VHZXck9YZXc%7C0d0je14PoBB%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Balio A registered trademark"",""reviewer_id"":""102364020839907304512"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102364020839907304512?hl=en-US"",""rating"":1,""review_text"":""This place is shady.

Commonwealth Pain & Spine is different from comparable pain management clinics in treating patients. The team avoids the standard surgery-first delivery model in favor of a less invasive, more cost-efficient model. Because each physician recognizes how exhausting chronic pain feels, they make it a point to empathize with the needs of their patients.

Brittney told me my MRI looked good when the radiologists report suggested otherwise and told me to see my neurologist to figure out what is wrong. I told her that the wait was extensive to get into the neurologist and that Dr. Freeman had suggested other approaches but she wasn't interested in helping me. She then asked me how my pain was being controlled and I responded that is was being controlled poorly. She said, \""Well opiates make it worse so it wouldn't help.\"" I told her that I wasn't interested in opiates and didn't want to have an addiction in addition to my chronic pain.

The policy is 5 years sober. Okay. Unfortunately, when I was asked about a health condition I have, she jumped immediately to a conclusion that put me in that group, when I don't belong to that group. She therefore quite astoundingly refused pain management for me. Wow.\nI will say (and did say in office), my condition could be made deadly with the consumption of alcohol, so I quit over a year ago when I found out about it. It certainly would have made sense for her to ask about the genetics, metabolic situation, and other health reasons that Caused my illness instead of just assuming that as I discontinued my small consumption, \""I must have been an abuser of alcohol\"". Such behavior is below most health care professionals.. facts are usually drawn before conclusions.\nShe may need more training in the prevention of abuse of power, judgmental behavior, and worsening stereotypes through discrimination. Three staff may also benefit from this same trading as the words \""on the sauce\"" were clearly heard through my patient room for after she departed the room. Shameful.\nMy regular health care providers, including my primary care and illness specific specialists, agree that although her discriminatory behavior and judgmental attitude would likely change if she were given the facts, seeking services from her or anyone in this office would be harmful to my own mental health.\nIf this is her attitude toward a new patient, she may want to administer PETH testing to all of her current patients. I would hate to see prescriptions being given to current consumers of alcohol or other drugs!

After scheduling my initial appointment, I knew that I would be taken care of. My Physician Assistant, Kyle Williams, kindly greeted me into the clinic, and took the time to listen to my main concerns of injuries, and then did a thorough exam to determine the severity of my injuries. After the exam, he provided his recommendations and suggestions, which gave me complete confidence to trust in Kyle Williams's opinion. During the consultation, he immediately referred me to an imaging place to get my MRI and X-ray taken. While I was there, he immediately referred me to their Physical Therapy department for a further evaluation. I appreciate everything Kyle Williams, PA-C, has done for me so far.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to express my appreciation to Megan Kane, the physical therapist at Mountain View Pain Center. When she was doing my evaluation of my injuries, my whole expectation was for her to only focus on the areas where I had pain or discomfort. However, the way she approached the evaluation was that she conducted a thorough examination to ensure I had no other unforeseen injuries. She took the time to help me understand why I have limitations on specific movements and developed a plan for me to work on, so I can expedite the recovery of my physical health.\n\nLastly, the staff here at the Fort Collins location have all been very kind to me and have been very helpful, especially since I had to reschedule my appointments multiple times."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""5 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-07-09T16:06:47"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Hi Drake, thank you for leaving us a review!

While Dr. Mehta was busy this morning, he did come into the pre-op prep area, saw me and waved hi. I don't feel the need to get into an in depth convo on the procedure since I'd had some on depth discussions with my previous doc in the Chicago area about this procedure. A patient mentioned to me that Dr. Mehta was very nice \""and had a great touch and is good at what he does,\"" and she was having some ambivalence about her procedure fearing pain. One can still trust their doctor and have a good opinion of them while not looking forward to surgery and fearing the pain afterwards. To hear  her invest trust in him in a difficult position and to also hear Dr Mehta does very well wit spinal nerve stimulators and evaluating patients as to their suitability for success, the smile and \""hey!\"" was enough for me- acknowledgement and casual but welcoming. DOC seems to have to work on an older building that doesn't have the bells and whistles I've been used to in the Chicago area. But the staff was welcoming, friendly, playing great 70s-80's music(makes for comfy ambiance, for m, anyway) and provided thorough, professional care. I'm a retired nurae myself and have had \""professional care\"" that was rushed and cold.. I did have to wait this morning but we got there early and know things don't start early on pre-op areas. But  chatting with other patients and nurses made it comfortable and relaxed. It may not be fancy but I felt more at home there than in fancy hospitals with donated fine art and huge airy lobbies."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""a week ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-12-13T04:53:36"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0dsnWgpCfvPhjLzbh4wWahpSk9i_9fPiTNTul-lav7EHvOqA0=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":19,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":true,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25WRFZ6aEpVMmc1ZWxnNVNXcEVkMWQ2YW1WblduYxAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25WRFZ6aEpVMmc1ZWxnNVNXcEVkMWQ2YW1WblduYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x50e6a2c2decca9f!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnVDVzhJU2g5elg5SWpEd1d6amVnWnc%7C0cwcYMrqiCu%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Pat Worley"",""reviewer_id"":""100368431015210403090"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368431015210403090?hl=en-US"",""rating"":5,""review_text"":""I am a 74 year old female.

She knows how to put you at ease prior to your visit with your PA or doctor. She's empathetic, courteous, and you don't feel like she is trying to rush to the next patient. I was seeing Dr. Amin until several months ago. She was transferred to the Middletown office, I believe. In the recent months I've seen Caroline who is one of the PA's. Caroline is a great mix of professionalism and caring. I'm very happy with the level of care I receive at Premiere Pain Treatment Institute.

We had recently moved from Scottsdale, Arizona and were searching for a pain management practice that is reputable and respected in all aspects.\nAfter our first encounter with Dr Martin Ferrillo, and his team, we knew that we had found the right place.\nDr. Ferrillo far exceeded our expectations.  He is personable and thorough in his assessment, and his approach is directed at management and treatment of pain that isn't dependent on medications that create dependency while failing to address the patients issues and needs.\nAdditionally, he is recognized as a superior practitioner by other physicians and is on the faculty of a major medical center.\nMy husband, Bill Kurtz, has recently become a patient, too. He shares the same experience.\nBased on conversations with others in the waiting room, patients all share the same view.\nThe team at ASCPM is always accommodating, warm and friendly.  You can rely on everyone being well trained and enjoying their role in whatever capacity they serve.  I feel I can speak from experience as I am a retired nurse and social worker for many, many years, most in an administrative capacity dealing with community issues that engaged government, education, business, and healthcare focused on the whole person.\nWe highly recommend this practice and Dr Ferrillo.\nSee for yourself!  Your treatment and plan is directed at treating your condition and will alleviate your current issues at all levels.

In particular, my experience with Heather B., who you will most likely have the pleasure of working with as she books appointments for patients at all three locations. Not only did she TEXT me back the next day after I called (YES, they will actually text you! For phone-phobic people like me, this is a huge blessing!), she was incredibly specific with salient details, in addition to a call back number so that we could get my appointment cemented. Once I phoned her up, she answered gleefully and made it clear to me, in the most professional of ways; that I should get on the phone with my referring doctor immediately as they had just had two cancellations for the next day in the location I would be visiting for my soon to be appointment. This meant ZERO DELAYS for me, which is more than any other person on THAT side of the phone has ever been willing to do for me. She could have left me to my own devices and capabilities (which would have been a mistake O.o ), but instead, she revealed that valuable information and then followed up with me today after my appointment. UNHEARD OF!!! This is service at it's finest, and I am pretty sure ASCPM should put her in charge of training any newcomer, or maybe just give her financial incentive to host a class on customer service done right! She went above and beyond, and she did it all with a smile on her face. Ok, technically, I couldn't see her face, but I could HEAR her smile!

Please, Please, Please do not go here or let one of your family get so called treatment here.\n\nFirst off, when we tried to get an appointment we send an message through the website with not answer, called with no answer and left message with no return call. We chose to actually drive to the office and talk to someone about making an appointment. When we got to the office we were told to go to the second office behind the main office to talk with the scheduler. There were 4 employees outside smoking and were very surprised to see us walk into an unattended office. Conveniently the scheduler was not there at the moment so we left paperwork with another employee and left. Astoundingly we received a call the next day to schedule. Not surprised that the person I spoke to was very unprofessional, used street jargon, and was downright rude. Like she was doing us a favor. The appointment was set for a month out.\n\nWe get to the appointment and we have to wait an hour and a half past our appointment time to see Dr. Pauley who could not seem to get a string of two words out with out stuttering. She seemed very incompetent. She explained some prescription changes and scribbled instructions on the back of a piece of paper. Professional, I know. Then stated an addiction assessment was needed before any pain medications would be prescribed. She send a referral that was not sent until one and a half weeks later and the progress notes or report of the visit was not on any paperwork aside from the scribbled notes, or forwarded to the facility my mother resides. Of course they did not check to see if the referring doctor took our insurance. I know you are surprised that they did not. We contacted PEMCO to let them know this. Shockingly, it took about two weeks to get some sort of resolution regarding this manner. With an assessment that is so important to the treatment of a wide range of the patients that are seen at this practice they only have one doctor they refer to for this service.\n\nAGAIN, DO NOT GO HERE FOR YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER, THEY ARE HORRIBLE FROM START TO FINISH.

Every doctor I went to, took one look at me and judged me from head to toe! Either they pre-labled me or simply refused to even see/help me. Until I  came across Dr. Soares.\nI researched him, as Im reading these crazy, nasty comments are popping up about him in the reviews, but something wasnt adding up to me. So I went to go find out for myself.\nI am so thankful that I followed my own intuition! (and not other people's negative comments that didnt get their way). I was in desperate search to ease this crippling chronic pain. However, I needed to be able to live my life still, do my jobs daily (physical hard work) not tired or sluggish and above all continue to be a present mother. I needed help that did NOT result in addictions or unable to function daily. After listening to me and finding what works best for my body, Dr. Soares has helped give me my life back and Im forever grateful .

I'm sorry...being the only one left to answer calls while your coworker is on lunch is NO EXCUSE to be rude and overtalk someone! Sheena evidently thinks she's above authority...when asked who she reports to she stated the CEO. She argued she cannot offer his number while the entire time I asked for an email to report her.

I would think being in the pain management business that one could expect at least a bit of pain relief to occur but unfortunately that did not happen. An interlaminar epidural spinal injection was performed and when my daughter had side effects from the procedure she called Dr. G's office and was told that those side effects were perfectly normal however when my daughter went back for her F/U appt the Dr told her that he would not attempt any other spine injections due to the fact that she experienced abnormal side effects from the procedure. So which is it, were the side effects normal or did the procedure cause problems that deemed my daughter as an unfit candidate for any future pain relief i.e, cervical injection etc? I'm also assuming that therapeutic nerve blocks do not exist in this office because we were told he does not do that. Also, when a prescription needed to be refilled that Dr had ordered initially and was set to run out, (a specific compound) she called that into Dr. G's office and was told he/someone would call that script into the compound pharmacy but that never took place so the script was never renewed.\nI had such high hopes for Dr. Gutierrez, I was certainly drawn to him because of his credentials but unfortunately my daughter is still in as much pain as before.\n**************\nI accompanied my daughter this week to her appointment with Dr. Gutierrez and everything went smoothly thanks to the Dr. and his staff. The Medical Assistant is super kind, thorough, and caring and Dr. Gutierrez impressed me a lot. I feel very comfortable with his expertise, you can just tell this guy knows his stuff and that he truly cares. I trust him and more importantly my daughter does too, he's open to discussion and really takes the time to listen. We've never had to wait too long while in his office which is saying a lot given the fact the waiting room is always pretty full, it's kinda striking the number of people that desperately need pain relief. Thankfully there are doctors who dedicate their careers to helping people in pain, I feel so fortunate to have found Dr. Gutierrez for my daughter, he's a great guy and I highly recommend him to others."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""Edited 2 weeks ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-09-19T21:43:07"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmmeWp115FuL0mopdIEnkyqXBZ53doXwCJSYmq0s52NVQByoOM=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":1,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GU2QyUXlSWE42TW1OTE5sTlZORWhqWVVOV2NrRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GU2QyUXlSWE42TW1OTE5sTlZORWhqWVVOV2NrRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xbe0b1f2b49a42098!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOnFSd2QyRXN6MmNLNlNVNEhjYUNWckE%7C0d48cuLqXqm%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Elouise Everett"",""reviewer_id"":""106230501368768936268"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106230501368768936268?hl=en-US"",""rating"":1,""review_text"":""Had severe, migrating upper leg to knee pain.

Livanta had trouble getting the records: that's because Dr. Smith and his crew were busy rewriting them. That's all Livanta does--records reviews-- so they gave the falsified records a pass. I have offered to take a polygraph test. Those injections did nothing for me other than cause me pain and bleeding at the injection site. Livanta has a terrible record with the BBB; I think it's creating a moral hazard.  Naturally, all the doctor has to do is falsify the records, and they are in the clear. I was going to report him to the State Medical Board, but my attorney advised to just get on with my life since I have a new doctor, and it would be time-consuming and distracting. All I would want to do is have the records expunged, and maybe have a menace doctor reprimanded for altering my chart in his favor. I wouldn't be surprised if he does it often. My MRIs show osteoarthritis and NOT sacroiliitis.

But the one good thing about that was during that time my pain was unbearable and I was thankfully recommended to Comprehensive. 1st...easy to get appt. around my schedule not just where they throw you, I always get at least a couple of options... then when you arrive you'll fill some paperwork out, it's self explanatory, but the wait time is negligible...I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 min to get taken to a room. I've never been looked at like i have 4 eyes, only professional treatment and trying things that are aimed at helping me maintain a mostly pain free lifestyle. They work with suggesting treatments and maintenance and allow for finding out what insurance will or will not cover and what you might be comfortable with out of pocket And they don't do things just to do em or pile up a nice bill . The main concern in my case anyway is how to keep me upright. . Oh, and the pharmacy screwed my meds up and Dr Herrera called the pharmacy and straightened it out on his own time.... who does that??? The staff there is awesome and are willing to try as best they can to give you a quick and thorough treatment that's best for you.

I have never had a pain management doctor that actually listens to me as a person, not just another patient.  He actua cares about me and my issues with pain.  His bedside  manner is fabulous.\nI have had several caudal  injections for my chronic back pain.  Each time I have it done, the pain lessens a little longer each time. If you have a fear of doing this, he is so gentle and you don't feel the needle at all. He numbs you up very good.  Absolutely no discomfort.\n\nSo I have fibromyalgia as well and we all know that nothing can be done about that but he makes you as comfortable as he possibly can.\n\nDr Herrera's PA, Kim, is amazing as well.  She listens to your concerns and genuinely cares for you. I love her so much. She also has a huge heart.\n\nSo if you have any issues with pain, my suggestion would be to pick up the phone and call the office to make an appointment.

The receptionist explained that they only do steroid shots there (didn't even ask medical conditions). But I do find that his response was quick and effective unlike other offices. I've had over 10 surgeries bc the military screwed up the first one. Every doctor here wants to do more surgeries or shots. I'm not a huge fan of opioids either but it's the only thing that's helped with the pain. So 3-5 stars for being quick, direct, effective.

She let you know you could see this primary care doctor or find another pain management but would not give you referral or even a name of any pain doctors.

Upon a follow-up visit from a procedure I stated it hadn't helped much, in fact the last week or so the pain was much worse. The physician assistant asked if I wanted any pain meds. I said that would be great. In the past I had refused any prescriptions for narcotics. They were going to send in a predetermination for a different procedure to my insurance company. I waited for a few weeks and hadn't heard from them so I called and left a message for the nurse. No call back from her, so I called again, and again, and again. Nobody has called me back!! It seems they want to help you as long as you don't ask for pain meds. If you do they cut you loose without a word as much from them. Extremely poor business practice and they don't seem to really care about there patients well being. I have referred 2 friends to them and they are currently seeing him for their pain management.

Yes, sometimes he is tied to insurance and pre-approvals, but when I have been at a level 10 pain, he has seen me in the same day and though perhaps I have had to agree to pay his cash price, knowing I can spread the cost of the treatment out over a few months.  At least he saw me the same day and treated me!  Other pain control docs in Omaha won't even see you until the insurance company agrees to pay for the treatment period!

All of the providers that I did very well with~they were very focused on individual care, with empathy and empowerment, left. In just my time there, they have had one massive loss of providers at the clinic. Then again a smaller loss in within a year or so. I've been assigned 4 new providers since I started there a couple of years ago. My most recent provider is extremely rude. After each subsequent visit she has become more outlandish. She does not ask before she starts touching, or LITERALLY poking into me, 8 times in one shot. Leaving me with 2 bruises. I had to tell her \""stop, your bruising me\"". As I stopped reacting to her firm poking, I caught her face and she had an odd smile on her face-VERY creepy. I did NOT even ask. It was too strange. She is very abrasive, accusatory, demanding, unyielding, judgemental and unable to communicate in a normal fashion. She actually began a prolonged verbal abusive assault that went on so long that I had asked her 4 times to stop yelling which she ignored. She continued her assault until I went to turn on my phone to record her since I didn't have anyone coming to stop her or help me. When she saw the phone, she quick finished a sentence and RACED out of the room to try to avoid a recording. The conclusion of my visit was like a continuation of a very bad dream. A hush fell when she left the room, and when I left. They heard her and nobody did a thing. Do not go here. Bullies. Dr. Anderson is the exception just as other's have written.

And no mention of patient agreement to be signed.   There was some confusion about his urine test so he left clinic without taking it.  She called and told him to come back in, with no further explanation about importance of test.  As a result, because he didn't return to clinic immediately for urine test, he was \""disqualified from the pain program\"" (which he didn't even know he was in and obviously hadn't signed any agreement about it) because of a \""failed\"" urine test.  Completely unethical and unprofessional.  She also seemed less focused on his current chronic pain issues and his desire to minimize pain meds and more focused on alcohol aftercare (sober 8 years).  When he indicated he's not getting alcohol treatment at this time and also wasn't interested in behavioral therapy, her responses were demeaning, she twisted his words and became combative.

I was directed from his office to contact my surgeon for postop pain control. So I do and my surgeons office wanted me to go back to Pain Management. This happened multiple times of the offices sending back to the other meanwhile I'm suffering. I even wrote his staff that I was aware that he didn't want to take care of my postop pain but wanted to see if he would increase my tramadol for my CHRONIC pain. I was in limbo between both places for my acute pain and my surgeon did end up sending a few different things at which were not helping and then again wanted me to talk to my pain specialist. So I do, again and tell them what's going on. But while waiting on a response my surgeon ended up sending me a new pain med,  all very small prescriptions btw. Still waiting on a response from Dr Ahmed's  clinic and when they do answer I tell them a script was sent 2 nights prior. So then I get a dismissal stating I was asking for pain meds between two offices. WHICH I WAS, because that's what I WAS DIRECTED TO DO. So now I have this dismissal as if I am in the wrong. Funny that they treat a person who is dealing with a ton of stress and in moderate pain and doing what they told me to do, like I am the problem! Very frustrating. My surgeon even called to speak to the manager to explain that they were wanting me to contact my pain management for pain and that I was simply in the middle of it all. But she stated she felt bad but is following office policy. What a shame. Because every case and every person's situation is not the same! Yet they treat us all like we have a problem. No, people like them are the problem. I will be fine. I will find a new specialist to help me. It's just the fact that I have been treated this way.\n\nFirst review: He is amazing! Caring and kind!

Let me start off by saying I am on a medication that MUST be taken every single day. The ONLY time I actually saw the dr was my 1st visit, he seemed very nice and that he truly cared about his patients wellbeing. Since that initial visit I only saw PA's who like the other reviews state cannot do ANYTHING without the drs ok. So every month I come in like clockwork, I pay my copay and do everything else I'm supposed to and time after time I'm waiting WEEKS for my medication to even be put into the pharmacy. And god help you if u need a prior approval first! I can't tell you how many times I've had to pay out of pocket bc this office was too lazy and unwilling to obtain a prior approval... I would call and call and call never received a return call. The last incident was again me waiting over a week to have my medication put in to the pharmacy, I called that office on the verge of tears multiple times just begging them to put the rx in ...  at that point I was so used to paying out of pocket bc no one would get me precert that I was just desperate to get my medication I wasn't even going to beg them for a precert.... the final call I made must've been \""after hours\"" when they transfer their calls to an employee cell phone... I called that night and dealt with 2 girls answering my calls while pretending they spoke French and couldn't understand me, laughing in the background like a couple of children. This went on for 3 phone calls until I just gave up. At this point I was getting so sick from not having my medication and just felt so disgusted that a doctors office was doing this to me, the next day I found another drs office who took me right in and I've been with them ever since - my rx is at my pharmacy before I even check out of my appt. PLEASE listen to these reviews, if you are on medication that needs to be taken everyday DO NOT rely on this office. They are uncaring, unprofessional and unapologetic. I don't write many reviews if any but after months of being with my new dr and seeing how caring him and his staff are and how they go out of their way for patients I cannot believe what I dealt with month after month.

Inwhich he made me do images then gave me two shots of muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory.  I mentioned my ehler danlos and he said he deals with other patients with it and they do spinal stimulant. Also suggested later on rheumatologist.  I guess he is clueless on ehlers later he confirmed it at today's appointment.  He said I was in a flare which shows me he didn't do research about ehlers since it's a chronic illness/pain due to joint instability . He thought rheumatologist would diagnose me when I've already had diagnosis through Mount sinai which is leading medical practice for eds. They mentioned how they don't do my chart. So as of how they got any medical history or records who knows. Since they weren't aware of my previous hospital visits or images. There was no check ups after the shots to find out how long pain relief happened and to be there when it stopped working. There was no follow up on giving me a way to get relief of pain without him . I made a doctors visit they scheduled a zoom since I'm having trouble getting around due to again joint instability . Their office is far from accessible for my self driven wheelchair from the handicap spots. They even saw I was there for another visit and didn't verify with the doctor it was still okay to do the meeting by zoom. This man doesn't care if his patients are in pain or the efforts it takes them to get to that location.  He doesn't care what your family has to do for you to be seen just for 3 days of no pain after decades of pain with no relief besides chiropractic. Then I found later by vascular I shouldn't do chiropractor.  Then Bilal Danish Lateef, MD suggested i do it anyway since I can cause vascular tears just from moving. Guess he doesn't understand the pain that occurs from constant muscle, soft tissue and nerve tissue since he down plays sleepless nights and not being to talk or eat without pain for MONTHS being a flare... He shouldn't be practicing when he's dismissive and trickles down care. Horrible . Anyone with ehlers don't bother he's useless , they should just throw him away. Just go to unc or duke. Even unc genetics didn't do blood work for heds diagnosis which is scary.. Wish these doctors tried harder to help the patients instead of red flags for giving narcotics,  doing the bare minimum and racking bills for visits/tests. Also for any ehlers patients who are considering spinal stimulant due to Bilal Danish Lateef, MD...\nTissue Fragility:\nEDS is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities, leading to increased tissue fragility and potential for complications with wound healing and lead migration.\nBleeding Disorders:\nSome EDS types are associated with bleeding or clotting issues. This can increase the risk of hematoma formation during or after implantation.\nLead Migration:\nThe leads of a spinal cord stimulator can potentially move out of place due to joint instability common in EDS, leading to loss of stimulation or the need for revision surgeries.\nGeneral Anesthesia:\nIf general anesthesia is required for the implantation, EDS patients may have increased risks associated with anesthesia, such as airway management issues or adverse reactions.\nIndividualized Assessment:\nA thorough evaluation by a pain specialist and potentially a geneticist experienced with EDS is crucial to assess the potential benefits and risks for each individual patient."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""4 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-08-14T16:29:14"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Sarah, thank you for reaching out to us.

It was the admin at Dr Ren's office. She said that she would like to rebook me for my steroid shots. I told her that I was not interested. She asked me if I would consider going to the South Campus to see Dr Ren and guaranteed that nurse would not be there. I agreed.\n\nSo, I got my steroid shots today at the south campus with Dr Ren. Again, she is fantastic and I definitely do not want to change doctors.\n\nIf you would like to avoid a horrible experience with the nurse who should be working at McDonald's and stay away from the care business, make the drive to the South Campus to see Dr Ren.\n\nIt's a shame that the Miami Valley Hospital System won't do more to protect their brand.

I wanted to warn others about my experience with this particular practice. Unfortunately, after seeking help from numerous doctors and exploring various avenues for pain management, this was my final attempt at finding relief.\n\nDr. Jan Gillespie-Wagner and Darci Rossitier were Dismissive and Uncaring. During my appointment, the doctors I encountered displayed a hostile and aggressive demeanor. They failed to consider the impact of my chronic pain on my daily life. Furthermore, they seemed quick to dismiss my concerns and stereotype me as a patient, rather than listening to my specific experiences.\n\nThey were apathetic towards atypical pain. The most concerning aspect was their lack of understanding or apparent disregard for my non-typical pain condition.

I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GO THROUGH THE TORTURE AND PAIN THAT THEY'RE PUTTING ME THROUGH. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT CALLING THEMSELVES PAIN MANAGEMENT!! I saw Dr. Radu in the office for severe neck shoulder and head pain. I have had 2 previous cervical spinal fusions and the pain has gotten more severe lately, mostly 10/10 and it feels like the fusion is pushing up into the back of my skull. He didn't order any imaging, he talked to me like I was some insignificant piece of garbage that was so far beneath him, I should be grateful that he's \""wasting\"" his time on me. He scheduled neck injections, which were more than 2 weeks away, and prescribed an anti inflammatory medication for me, which I was hesitant, because I repeatedly told him the pain was up in the bone. He ignored me. I tried the prescribed medication for about a week with no improvement. I called the office and let them know that the medication was not working. Later that day he sent in a muscle relaxing medication, for pain that is originating and radiating through the remaining \""normal\"" vertebrae and up into the occipital BONE. Still, I do what he instructed and try the medication. It did not work because a muscle relaxer will not help bone pain. I call the office 3 times. First, I was told that he was seeing patients all day and he'll call me when he has a chance. By afternoon, still nothing, I'm in excruciating pain, and do NOT want to go to the ED, I call again. Now they tell me he isn't there today and put me through to his nurse. The nurse tells me that she's going to send the Dr a message and call back ASAP. By 4:30 pm, still nothing. I call again, in tears, the secretary tells me that she sent the note to the nurse and she's not viewed the note yet, and there is no note for the DR in the communication AT ALL. She sends ANOTHER note to the nurse. In the mean time I get to spend ANOTHER night in pain, crying not sleeping, feeling like I'm being tortured and a sledge hammer is going through the back of my skull. WHY DO THEY CALL THEMSELVES PAIN MANAGEMENT IF THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF HELPING. Dr. Radu is arrogant, cold, dismissive and acts as though his patients should feel honored to be in his presence.

It seems his only focus is how many procedures can he perform and get through a day, regardless of how much pain he inflicts.His people skills are the worst of any doctor, physician assistant, nurse or medical personnel I have ever met or come in contact with. Nerve test procedure it seemed the more I cringed from the pain of him sticking me with needles and zapping me, the more aggressive he became almost enjoying it. I will not recommend Premier Spine and Pain Institute to anybody, family foe or patient, and Dr Michael Tracy was so rude and crude and disrespectful almost makes me think someone needs to check out his credentials and make sure he's really got a degree to be doing what he's doing.\n\nNow for the billing department, I have been harassed on a daily basis between text, voicemails, emails, and every day a bill arrives in the mail harassing me for $105 outstanding balance, which after many times of trying to reach the billing department, finally found out they never build Medicaid. I have given them my insurance information several times for my insurance and why they can't take the time to build the insurance company but they have time to harass me is beyond me.\n\nSo if you can go to any other facility for what you need done at Premier Spine and Pain Institute I recommend you go that direction and avoid premiere if you can."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""4 months ago"",""published_at_date"":""2025-08-13T23:25:51"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXXVaZ_aNXs1Lk5-uSelJFJI8uU2nPEgzTF39aHYZ3ehXhqkVGm=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":11,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21ORGNtNTVlVWRsY1hsMVJFMDVYMUpOUVRoVGMxRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21ORGNtNTVlVWRsY1hsMVJFMDVYMUpOUVRoVGMxRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x2eac8dea51174b1c!3m1!1s2@1:CAIQACodChtycF9oOmNDcm55eUdlcXl1RE05X1JNQThTc1E%7C0cQHS4OgsLL%7C?hl=en-US"",""name"":""Cheryl Hixenbaugh"",""reviewer_id"":""107395458334998043656"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107395458334998043656?hl=en-US"",""rating"":1,""review_text"":""Warning, do not visit!
