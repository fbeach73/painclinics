So this is the third time our family has been given the 'doctor-by-check-boxes' treatment, instead of actual care. Yesterday on our drive home from airport after a vacation in AK, we stopped in to see if they would give our son some antibiotics for a sinus infection he had been dealing with for 3 days. In the check-in process they ask if he has a fever, and he had, so they sent him outside to sit in the car in 85f heat and said they would send people out to check him in the parking lot like a third world country. My son is 8yrs old and in great health. Dr Stockton would NEVER have allowed this!! Thirty minutes later a person comes out and takes the same information that was already given at the check-in, and does temp check- normal, and O2 sat, and normal. Nurse asks us if we want a COVID test, and we decline, because we have been together in tight quarters for 10days on vacation and no one else has any symptoms, none. Not 1 or 2 common symptoms, but none. This is not a viral issue, or if it is, its not COVID. Another 20 minutes outside(my son should have been taken inside at this point, since he has no registered fever and no lower respiratory issues, no cough) and Dr or PA comes out, looks at him a little bit in our mini-van exam room(I should back-charge for the use of my mini-van resources) and strongly suggests we get a COVID test, to which we ask why its necessary, and we state for the umpteenth time we think this is a sinus infection, not COVID. But we conform, and they do a test. Another 30min and the test comes back negative, big surprise. And now, the Dr says, probably the beginning of sinus infection, and to take flonase, afrin, and netipot, and motrine for fever. We already were using flonase, netipot, and motrine from Walgreens in Anchorage a day prior, and it was not working. I made a comment about how I felt the $120 test was unnecessary, and his rebuttal was he's seen people die from COVID, and I rebut that might have been a year ago, but not the last 6months. He said we wanted a COVID test because he wanted to give us the best care possible. Reminder: We are sitting in car, outside in 85f heat, being treated in a parking lot for the last 1.5hrs. Since he didn't prescribe antibiotics(likely the \""best care\"" for sinus infecti0n), and suggested over the counter meds, which we do appreciate that as a first step, even through we had already been doing that with no improvements, he could have suggested a home COVID test too, which would have been $20/for 2 tests. Let's keep that COVID cash register crankin'! This non-treatment and healtcare COVID fear is brewing reluctance to seek medical care = dangerous and self-inflicted."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""3 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-08-20T14:13:25"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXrm7nlYxO-TK6xtlS59ZYdp8Ldhm28Yg-Nvlg8z2_94f9eUXLhSA=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":31,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":14,""is_local_guide"":true,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MDduMmR3EAE"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MDduMmR3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9a8a504be9900ade!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICu07n2dw%7CCgwIz421lwYQoLeelwI%7C?hl=en"",""name"":""Charles Burd"",""reviewer_id"":""116805817012561526205"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116805817012561526205?hl=en"",""rating"":5,""review_text"":""They fixed my badly cut thumb in the emergency room fast."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""3 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-08-05T16:35:27"",""response_from_owner_text"":""Thank you for your feedback!"",""response_from_owner_ago"":""3 years ago"",""response_from_owner_date"":""2022-08-05T18:11:58"",""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX4twRA8e0K_0yj8N_bNIRtJNPM05TUau1dUVo1FTS3q1vKew28Rg=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":35,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":74,""is_local_guide"":true,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNk9uWE93EAE"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtNk9uWE93EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9a8a504be9900ade!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDm6OnXOw%7CCgwI5dqWjwYQ4M3qjQM%7C?hl=en"",""name"":""Alexis Green"",""reviewer_id"":""105044530327922931174"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105044530327922931174?hl=en"",""rating"":1,""review_text"":""If you come down with pneumonia and have bills that haven't been paid EVEN SMALL BILLS OF LIKE $50 they will deny service!!!"",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""3 years ago"",""published_at_date"":""2022-01-17T17:54:45"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKyaiswCQFZDCTUm8w-D4DftopXu7o2_OtITZUF5xjaz4BfOQ=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":4,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOTc2QnF3RRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOTc2QnF3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x9a8a504be9900ade!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICm976BqwE%7CCgwIpLX9jgYQ8LqKogE%7C?hl=en"",""name"":""Ruthanna Reardon"",""reviewer_id"":""118018691175627263354"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118018691175627263354?hl=en"",""rating"":1,""review_text"":""The providers are excellent.

I would travel from another state to continue my care with PCC Lander, they're worth the trip.\nThank you all for your hard work, empathy and compassion, my life is a lot easier with your support."",""original_language"":""en"",""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""Edited a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2023-07-09T11:18:50"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXhFByebIhLW8D_16Hyo9A-5qEA3m0QvQs9ZSHs-iaWvAhtIyDB=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":4,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQcWVyZmdBRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQcWVyZmdBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7e54d36a3c252c3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDPqerfgAE%7CCgsI-da8ugYQkLm6bA%7C?hl=en"",""name"":""Kaysha Kompkoff"",""reviewer_id"":""110046706772916484206"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110046706772916484206?hl=en"",""rating"":5,""review_text"":null,""original_language"":null,""review_translated_text"":null,""translated_language"":null,""published_at"":""a year ago"",""published_at_date"":""2024-12-03T16:02:01"",""response_from_owner_text"":null,""response_from_owner_ago"":null,""response_from_owner_date"":null,""response_from_owner_translated_text"":null,""avatar_link"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIbRA_vTwu7dwJlmrk3xy9DFqprA5l2fgr66kpUj5udprOuEg=s1920"",""total_number_of_reviews_by_reviewer"":1,""total_number_of_photos_by_reviewer"":0,""is_local_guide"":false,""experience_details"":[],""review_photos"":[],""review_origin"":""google""},{""review_id"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQallLSmlRRRAB"",""review_link"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQallLSmlRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xa7e54d36a3c252c3!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICPjYKJiQE%7CCgwIudWYugYQiJe8zAE%7C?hl=en"",""name"":""Kris Randolph"",""reviewer_id"":""114880795911802657473"",""reviewer_profile"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114880795911802657473?hl=en"",""rating"":5,""review_text"":""The pain center in Lander has been awesome.

I went with nerve pain to left ankle. They did an X-ray which doesn't show nerve damage. They didn't even look at my ankle or palpate swollen area., or watched my gait. Just referred for MRI. I will not go back to this office. Waited a full week before MRI. Found partial torn Achilles and posterior tibialis tendon tear with an ankle bone contusion.

This eliminated my having to come back the next day for the CT scan.  You should know that these are exceptional folks, seeing me as a person and not just a procedure.  Sherry has been so helpful up-front meeting my spouses need for extra care without our asking for help.

A world of differences in other hospitals. I hope next time I have enough money to go to Riverton or even Casper. But when it is urgent you have no choice. Not my first choice. Some of the medical professionals need to understand privacy and some need to understand compassion. I wish they take a good look at their operational procedures. Professional is not the word I would use for some of their staff. They did not find or was able to die the procedure correctly. So rather set up an appointment to try again or refer me to another professional they didn't do that they did even tell me if I had any other options. They just said it didn't work and sent me home. That day was one of the worst days of my life and it took four days to recover from their unprofessionalism way of doing things. I hate to say that they are bias at color or poor people but I have had my veterinarian treat my dog better. Again not all were like that some were very attentive and made me very comfortable like the doctor but some that work in the background of that hospital  could use more training of what to do if they're are issues with a procedure rather then forcing something that might work or might not.  I will be going to somewhere else to get this procedure done.

A world of differences in other hospitals. I hope next time I have enough money to go to Riverton or even Casper. But when it is urgent you have no choice. Not my first choice. Some of the medical professionals need to understand privacy and some need to understand compassion. I wish they take a good look at their operational procedures. Professional is not the word I would use for some of their staff. They did not find or was able to die the procedure correctly. So rather set up an appointment to try again or refer me to another professional they didn't do that they did even tell me if I had any other options. They just said it didn't work and sent me home. That day was one of the worst days of my life and it took four days to recover from their unprofessionalism way of doing things. I hate to say that they are bias at color or poor people but I have had my veterinarian treat my dog better. Again not all were like that some were very attentive and made me very comfortable like the doctor but some that work in the background of that hospital  could use more training of what to do if they're are issues with a procedure rather then forcing something that might work or might not.  I will be going to somewhere else to get this procedure done.

I presented with abdominal pain and distension. After waiting for over 30 minutes I was taken back and discovered there were no other patients. I did receive timely blood work, an EKG and a CT scan.  The only person who offered me a blanket was the gentleman from. Radiology. I was finally given a call light a half hour before discharge.
