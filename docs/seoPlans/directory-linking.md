Why it makes sense for painclinics.com:                                         
                                                                                  
  - Your state/city pages (/pain-management/tx, /pain-management/tx/houston) are  
  the exact type of local resource that business directories link to              
  - Directory-to-directory links carry topical relevance — Google understands the 
  relationship                                                                    
  - Your 14% index rate means you need more external signals to get Google to     
  crawl and index deeper pages                                                    
  - State/city pages are your mid-funnel — getting them ranking lifts the entire  
  long-tail                                                                       
                                                                                  
  What actually works in 2026:                                                    
                                                                                  
  1. Chamber of Commerce sites — many have "local resources" or "healthcare       
  directories" sections. These are high-authority .org links
  2. State health department resource pages — some maintain lists of pain
  management resources
  3. City/county .gov resource pages — hardest to get but most valuable
  4. Niche medical directories (not general business ones) — SAMHSA, state medical
   board directories, chronic pain advocacy orgs
  5. Local library resource pages — often link to health directories

  What to avoid:

  - Mass submissions to low-quality general directories (Yelp clones, spam
  directories) — waste of time, possible negative signal
  - Paid directory listings on sites that exist solely to sell links
  - Anything with "submit your site" on every page

  Practical approach:

  - Prioritize your top 10-15 state pages by search volume (TX, CA, FL, NY, OH,
  PA) rather than all 50
  - Pitch it as "free pain management resource for [City] residents" — you're
  providing value, not asking for a favor
  - Your city pages with 50+ clinic listings are genuinely useful local resources
  — that's your angle

  One higher-leverage move: Write a state-specific "Guide to Pain Management in
  [State]" content piece for your top states. Much easier to earn links to a guide
   than a directory listing page. Then internally link that guide to your
  state/city pages.

  The backlink difficulty for directory sites is real, but your medical niche
  actually helps — health resource pages on .gov and .org sites actively look for
  directories to link to. It's worth the outreach effort for your top pages.
