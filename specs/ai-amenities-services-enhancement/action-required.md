# Action Required: AI-Powered Amenities & Services Enhancement

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

## Notes

- The feature uses the existing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable (already configured)
- The `amenities` field already exists in the database schema as `text[]`
- The `services` and `clinicServices` tables already exist with the required structure
- Admin authentication is already in place via `checkAdminApi()`
