# Action Required: SEO/URL Preservation

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] **Verify database permalinks** - Query database to confirm permalinks are in correct format (`pain-management/{slug}`) before building routes. If format is wrong, data may need re-importing.

## During Implementation

None required - all implementation tasks can be automated.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Submit sitemap to Google Search Console** - After sitemap is deployed, submit the new sitemap.xml URL to Google Search Console to expedite crawling
- [ ] **Validate structured data** - Test sample clinic pages with Google Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to ensure Schema.org markup is valid
- [ ] **Monitor Search Console for crawl errors** - Check for 404s, redirect loops, or other issues in the first week after launch
- [ ] **Verify rankings** - Monitor key search terms (e.g., "Alabama Pain Physicians Birmingham") to confirm rankings are preserved
