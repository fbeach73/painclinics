# Action Required: Lead Follow-up System

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically using existing infrastructure:
- Mailgun is already configured for email sending
- Database connection (Neon) is already set up
- Admin authentication is already in place
- All required environment variables exist

---

> **Note:** After implementation, you may want to:
> - Test the contact form to verify leads are being created
> - Review the follow-up email template content before sending to real clinics
