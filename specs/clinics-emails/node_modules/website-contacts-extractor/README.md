# Website Contacts Extractor

The Website Contacts Extractor is an API client for the [Website Contacts Extractor](https://www.omkar.cloud/tools/website-contacts-extractor) that allows you to easily extract contact information (emails and social media links) from any website. It gets these details from the "Contact Us" pages of websites.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install website-contacts-extractor
```

## Usage

To use the library, you need to import the `Api` class, create an instance with your API key, and then call the `getContacts` method.

```javascript
import Api from 'website-contacts-extractor';

async function main() {
    // Create an instance of the API with your API key
    const api = new Api({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        createResponseFiles: true, // Optional: saves responses to files for debugging, remove this in production.
    });
    const contacts = await api.getContacts('https://www.apple.com/');
}

main();
```

### Parameters

The `Api` constructor accepts the following parameters:

- `apiKey` (string, required): Your API key for the service.
- `createResponseFiles` (boolean, optional, default: `false`): If set to `true`, the library will save the JSON response from the API to a file in the `output/responses` directory. Useful for debugging. Remove this parameter in production.
