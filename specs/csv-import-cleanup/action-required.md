# Action Required: CSV Import Cleanup & Code Consolidation

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically:

- Package installation (`pnpm add isomorphic-dompurify`) is automated
- Database migration (`pnpm db:push`) is automated
- All code changes are refactoring existing functionality

---

> **Note:** The database migration will run automatically. Ensure you have database connectivity when running Phase 4.
