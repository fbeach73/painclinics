No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

## Post-Implementation Recommendations (Optional)

These are not blockers but recommended for full SEO optimization:

- [ ] **Submit sitemap to Google Search Console** - After deployment, submit the updated sitemap URL to ensure Google crawls the new city pages
- [ ] **Test with Google Rich Results Test** - Validate a sample of clinic pages to ensure schema markup is recognized
- [ ] **Add logo.png to public folder** - The Organization schema references `/logo.png` - ensure this file exists
- [ ] **Monitor Search Console** - Check for any structured data errors after deployment

> **Note:** These are post-deployment verification steps, not implementation blockers.
