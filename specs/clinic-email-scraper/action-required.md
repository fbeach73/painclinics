# Action Required: Clinic Email Scraper

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] **Get API key for website-contacts-extractor** - Required for the scraping API. User mentioned they have 32,000 credits available. Set as `CONTACTS_API_KEY` environment variable.

## During Implementation

None required.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Monitor API credit usage** - With 32,000 credits and ~4,400 clinics to scrape, there's plenty of headroom. Check API dashboard periodically to ensure credits aren't exhausted.
