# Action Required: Analytics Code Cleanup

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically. This is a refactoring effort that:
- Consolidates existing code
- Adds a new dependency (SWR) via package manager
- Fixes linting issues

No API keys, environment variables, or third-party service configuration needed.
