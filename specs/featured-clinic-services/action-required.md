# Action Required: Featured Clinic Services

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically:

- Database migrations are handled via Drizzle CLI
- Seed data is applied via script
- No external services or API keys needed
- No environment variables to configure
- Uses existing authentication system

---

> **Note:** The implementation relies on existing infrastructure (PostgreSQL, BetterAuth, Lucide icons) that is already configured in the project.
