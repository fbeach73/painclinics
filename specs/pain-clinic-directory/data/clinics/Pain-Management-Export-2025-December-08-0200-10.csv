He's quick to the point, doesn't mince words or waste time. He comes in looking a bit like a butcher with that x-ray proof apron on, tells you exactly what he's going to do, does it, then swiftly moves on to his next patient.

Some people might find this a bit off-putting because he's so rigid that it makes you feel like he doesn't care about you. But when I'm looking for someone to do what basically comes down to minor surgical procedures on my spine I'm not trying to find a friend or judge their ability to do their job on how much they make me smile. In this situation I think it's a good thing to have a physician who is extremely technical and hyperfocused on his work and not just a people pleaser.

From my experience I deduced that giving injections and doing nerve ablations to a large number of people is the bulk of his job. I have never interacted with Dr Kunkel outside of the outpatient procedure center; I never met him at his pain management office, other physicians always handled my appointments there, so I believe the only decisions that he made about my care revolved around my injections and nerve ablations.

Both my Dad and I had procedures done by Dr Kunkel on a regular basis for a couple of years and we always found him to be quite professional. He takes his job very seriously! Sometimes our injections helped, sometimes they didn't, but I don't think that had anything to do with what he did or didn't do.

There are a series of steps that have to be followed for a doctor to figure out exactly what area is causing the problem and get to the point of doing something more permanent to help relieve the pain. It can be frustrating and time consuming - when a person is in pain they are seeking immediate relief and what he does doesn't usually give that.

I will say that the extremely long waits in the procedure center got REALLY old, but I don't know how much of that was his fault directly. Almost every time (for both my father and I) the wait past when our appointment was scheduled was HOURS. It sucked extra bad because we weren't able to eat or drink anything past midnight, and of course it's hard to sit there for so long when you're in pain.

But all the nurses were always really kind and fast at doing what they do. The ladies who assist Dr Kunkel in the actual procedure room constantly cracked me up - they were funny, super upbeat and jamming out to music. Everyone was as gentle as they could be - of course I experienced pain while that needle was being jammed in my spine, but they tried hard to be careful when it came to everything else and I was usually offered some sort of pain relief prior whenever possible.

I can understand why some people have given him such low reviews, but I've had far worse doctors and think he deserves some respect for having such a difficult job and doing the technical aspects of it so well. Pain management is hard, especially back pain. It's a long road with lots of hits & misses that sometimes ends in surgery or never gets resolved at all.

I can't say that I ever got anything more than some temporary relief from the procedures that were done, and sometimes they even caused me more agony. But I didn't continue with them so I'm not sure what sort of outcome I would of had in the end, if there was ever an end. I have major issues throughout my entire spine because of a degenerative disease, but somebody who had an injury or damage at one level might have better outcomes than those of us who are in chronic, widespread pain.|Attempted nerve blocks on both sides of my neck left me hemorrhaging into my chest. I couldn't turn my head for a month. I was strapped to a table, sobbing and begging him to stop due to the pain. He still carried out all 4 injections. No means assault. He clearly has no problem assaulting his patients.|Dr Kunkel & Dr Knox does a excellent job treating your problems and finding the best solution to each problem. Pain management in Phelps Health is set on finding the perfect solution to your pain that doesn't involve taking medications(pills) for life!|I'm only putting 4 because I've only been twice. They've accommodated me nicely. I only go for shots for now. Dr. Kunkel is nice but very professional. I don't take sedation when I get my procedures and right now it's on both sides of my neck., he's that gentle and good sedation isn't needed. The pain I experience isn't even a hair compared to that. I think he's great and so are the nurses.|I haven't had any success, as far as the pain being better, but this office is very professional and I really like Dr. Knox.  He is down to earth and was always respectful of me, yet friendly and kind.  I took away one star for Dr. Kunkel's reserved personality.  I don't quite know how to take him.  He is very knowledgeable though, so I do not mind if he does the procedures or not.  All procedures were very quick, small amount of pain from injections into spine and the nurses were just fabulous and they were funny.  They would have me chuckling in no time at all.  In general I am glad to be with this clinic and I have faith in both doctors ability to help me.  I would recommend this clinic to anyone who asked me.|My husband has been seeing Dr. Kunkel for several years now. Each visit seems to take longer and longer. I don't always have someone to watch our young children (8 and 1) so waiting 3 plus hours is not really ideal! You guys really should get it together. Some of us don't have all day to sit around waiting on you.|Dr Kunkel is very professional and by the book.

Jen, the NP is awesome  and is very knowledgeable and helpful with any questions I have had during my visits. Michelle, the MA is outstanding and makes sure all the patients are checked in and taken care of in a timely manner. Dr. Boedefeld and Dr. Shelton are extremely talented pain management physicians and have helped me tremendously with providing  pain relief.

Kate, Rebecca, Lindsay & Karissa were all very thorough, professional, & knowledgeable. They followed up with me afterwards & I can tell that they're very dedicated to their jobs.  Nobody likes to have ""procedures"" done on them, especially when they're in pain, but Dr. Shelton & everyone took the time to make sure I was comfortable & informed about everything that was happening at all times.|Always very helpful and this at the front desk give you the needed attention to get you set.   It's been a good Dr. Office to go to.  Care is always the gighest value.|Bad experience... I went in to find out what Dr. Shelton could do for my back pain - the possibility was to get a shot in my back.  When the Dr. finally came into the room, he did explain what was going on and what he could do but he did so at a very fast pace and in terms that were a bit above me.  We did talk for a bit, and I tried to get clarifications, but he was in a hurry. He told me he was behind schedule and also recognized that he often spoke ""Dr. language"" and not ""everyday person"" language.  I did not feel comfortable with him being in a hurry to do anything to me, nor did I feel I was being serviced or cared for (to be a patient).   He left the room without a ""goodbye"" and therefore I walked out of the office without a goodbye or saying anything to anyone.  No nurse, receptionist, no one noticed my departure (nor probably cared....).  To the Dr.'s  credit, he DID call me that evening and apologized for the way I was treated.  Again, he admitted he was in a hurry, and that he didn't always make himself clear by how he speaks.  I have opted not to return to an office/Dr. who cannot relate to his patients or zips through what is routine for him, but scary to others (stick a needle into my back/spine????).  To make the situation sadder?  I received a bill for the office visit:  After insurance paid out, I was left with a $18.00 bill.  Not much, for sure, but I called the office and asked if they would waive the $18.00 due to the Dr.'s admitted poor service to me (being in a hurry and not answering my questions in a way I could understand).  After several calls, I was told by Molly that Jody and the Dr. were consulted and that they would NOT waive the $18.00 charges.  I guess the office has upset enough people that they are in dire need of all the money they can get.  The Dr. who referred me to this Dr. has stated he will not be sending anyone else to him due to all these factors.  If you plan to go, be sure you catch him/the office on a slow day! (and good luck!)|It's tough to love a pain management clinic because when you first start going, your pain is out of control, and you are pissed at the world.

Never judgemental and they make sure if you follow their instructions and keep up with your appointments they do what is best for your needs to control your pain. Again if I could give them more than 5 stars I would. I am now on the medication needed to help me live somewhat of a normal life. I am so thankful I found this clinic. It's a blessing|Dr. Lee really cares about her patients. She listens to you and develops a plan with you for your care. I have seen many pain management doctors for chronic pain issues over the last 15 years and she is the best. Other doctors just form opinions of you and won't listen or are controlled by the medical facility they work for and do not take good care of their patients. Dr. Lee is not that way. Dee her nurse is also great. The two of them truly are the best.|I have been a patient for over 2 years and they have worked with me to get my pain under control to the point I am able to work again. Dee is wonderful to communicate with and the doctor sincerely cares about her patients.|Great clinic to go to. The nurse and Dr at this place are awesome and very caring people!

To the professionalism of the Nurses at the nurses station..
They're all so sweet and kind to me. They always make sure that I have understood fully what will be taking place when the Doctor comes into the exam room.
Then whenever the Doctor comes in the room, He always explains explains how the procedure works and then he tells me what will happen in each phase of the procedure that he is going to do to my body.

I liked him a lot. He figured out a remedy that made me feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend him to anybody.his assistant Erin was awesome too. She makes it all come together. They make a great team. They have compassion.|Great Doctor he actually Helps me manage my pain. Alternative and control options. One complaint. Do not lose your medicine or in my case have your medicine stolen. He will not help you even with police report. He is thoughtful and genuinely wants to make sure your get the proper treatment. He's not just throwing test after test at you like some doctors. Again Great Doctor and wonderful person.|I highly recommend, Doctor Beyzer and his staff. I have been dealing with 2 bad back surgery's for years and have been to many pain doctors. I was lucky enough to have doctor Beyzer recommend to me several years ago. This group is professional , knowledgeable, compassionate and caring. I can honestly say that with out the help of this doctor and his wonderful staff I would not be able to due my daily functions.                                  Michael R|On my very first appointment back in 2013-14, Dr Beyzer waiting room was packed with ppl waiting to see him! I found out why, he wrote me a script for 90 Percocet 10, that's 3 a-day. After about 3-4 months he upped it to 120 a month. I had went to see him for a herniated disc and a bulging disc. Fast forward 3yrs still getting scripts and really relaying on these pills cause now I'm hooked... Heats on now about Doctor's over prescribing their patients.  Now pressure me to buy his diet Optavia at $400 months or no script! I believe my last visit to see him was back in 2019-20, I winged myself off the drugs and doing real good. Needless to say it's always about the mighty $$$.  Be careful who you pick for your healthcare because some Doctors do not care about you.|If I could give him zero stars, I would in a heartbeat. I'm not one to write reviews at all, but I've got to for him. So, he has this $375/month diet plan, Optavia, that he sells. Im not going to lie, I need to lose weight, however, I'm young, several back surgeries, and only went to him bc my first pain management doctor that I had gone to for 17-18 yrs got sick and had to close his practice...he's doing better, but he doesn't need to add more stress in his life. Anyway, I went to Dr. Beyzer, who my pain management doctor told me to go before we all knew he wasn't going to come back to work. Dr. Beyzer only cares about that diet plan. I'm not able to work so I can't afford to do that plan, but that's all he talked about, and then said that I could sell it as well. Then if I didn't lose some weight, he'd stop giving me my meds. I can't workout and do a lot of walking without being in a lot of pain afterwards, sometimes for days, so it's harder for me to lose it. But with his diet, I wouldn't have to workout. I'm on pain medication that a lot of doctors aren't prescribing, but I decided that I'd rather go down in my doses than have to go back to him. It was mentally draining, and I think I cried after every visit. I'll give him credit, he did help me go down in my doses for one of my meds, but I went even lower bc this other pain management doctor said he'd see me as a patient full time. The girls who work in the office are great and super sweet. Would I suggest you go to Dr. Beyzer? No! He just always made me feel like I was never good enough, that losing weight was the only thing he cared about. My pain is going to be bad no matter my size. I have nerve damage in my legs, Degenerative Disc Disease, and spinal stenosis, and that's not going to change with Optavia! There are other doctor's out there who will take the time to get to know you and not criticize you for every little thing! It's been over a year since I've last seen Dr. Beyzer and I've done better with Dr. Shelton a million times over Dr. Beyzer. Seriously, if a doctor is threatening to take away your pain medications if you don't sign up for their diet plan is beyond unethical. I've debated on whether to report him bc the thought of him treating other patients like this doesn't sit well with me. I don't know where some of these 5 or 4 star reviews are coming from. I've been in that waiting room with other patients like me, who feel the same way.|Dr. Beyzer provides a holistic approach to pain management, focusing not just on immediate relief but on long-term wellness. His comprehensive care includes a blend of advanced medical treatments and a deep understanding of the body's natural healing processes. This integrative approach has made a significant difference in my recovery and overall well-being. Highly recommend Dr. Beyzer for anyone seeking a doctor who looks at health as a whole.|Dr Beyzer is a great doctor, very caring and understanding. He has been treating me for chronic pain that I have from a serious neck injury. His care has allowed me to have a much better quality of life.

Barry & Rachel Feinberg have giving me the best treatment & care that a patient could ask for. They really care for their patients and are very easy too speak with. The staff is very friendly, professional & easy to work with. I highly recommend them for patients that need someone who cares!|My experience at this practice was an answer to my prayers!  The Feinberg Drs quickly assessed the cause of my pain and walked me through the treatment needed.  Their knowledge is unmatched by other physicians in the St Louis area.
In pain?  Make your first appointment here!|I have been seeing Dr Barry and Dr.Rachel for years and they are hands down the most knowledgeable and experienced in their field! I have had many back surgeries and trauma! They give you honest information and compassionate experience every time you visit them. If the world had many more like them we definitely would be a better place.|I have been seeing Dr Rachel for years.  She is the best pain management and most caring doctor I have ever seen for my back issues.  She knows exactly what is causing pain and treats it immediately.  I can't imagine ever seeing anyone else!|If you are looking for a Doctor who is easy to communicate with, who listens and can help you make sense of your pain, look no further. Dr Barry is your man one of the best in the business!|Injury Specialists boasts an amazing, knowledgable staff in an elaborate environment.  It's about as lavish as a doctor's office can be, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Dr. Barry and Dr. Rachel are simply outstanding.  Dr. Barry was the first one to examine my entire body (not just the spine), and he identified a leg length discrepancy (my right leg is shorter than my left leg by 8 mm).  The disparity had caused my right shoulder to drop, and I didn't notice it until I started having chronic pain in my neck/upper back area.

What followed was a series of injections, PT, and inserting a heel lift in my right shoe, which I still wear to this day.  Dr. Barry is kind, empathetic, compassionate, and incredibly intelligent.  His optimism and confidence helped me through a very dark time in my life, and I will always be grateful for his excellent care and advice.  He genuinely wants to help people who are in pain!|SEVERELY disappointed.  My First visit they requested my MRI records, which was dated from 2017. After reviewing the records they administered a muscle relaxer to loosen my back, the third visit I was administered the steroid  shot. The shot was unsuccessful. Upon my forth visit, I was informed that the MRI was too old, and I should have an updated one done!! Meanwhile I'm receiving medical bills totaling more than 700.00. If the MRI was outdated on the 4th visit, then it was outdated on the FIRST visit!!
They also have a policy to charge for a no call/no show. But as a patient is okay to have me wait 1 hour and 45 minutes for service. That's NOT acceptable. My time has value as does theirs.

I had always been injected before without an imaging machine and the injections would hold up maybe six months to a year. As the other review stated it was a little more uncomfortable than I preferred, but I also could tell immediately that he was really addressing the concern and not just putting a Band-Aid on it, I got it through just fine. I got through it just fine ...HUMMING helped a lot. He explained that he doesn't want you on too many drugs because he needs you to feel if he's really addressing the concern. The staff was very kind also. And like any doctor, there is a wait sometimes when he is trying to get everyone in that's hurting for the day my last doctor would continue to push pain pills on me, even though I explain that my brother died from an opiate addiction. I love that he has other options for you not just writing scripts, that means the world to me!!|Dr. Anderson is amazing! He has truly helped me more in my first month than any doctor has in 9 years. All of the staff are amazing, from the time you walk in and greeted by Betsy, then taken back by Lisa and in the injection room with Lori. They're all so kind and personable and treat you the way they would want to be treated. I highly recommend them!!!|I like Dr.Anderson, however, one must be prepared, I thought it was just me.  I went to the dr. two years ago in Feb for painful sciatic, he gave me an epidural in back.  It almost caused me to pass out, very intense pain.  Lasted 18 months. I was there two weeks ago, as another condition in entire right and left leg developed.  Now, he gave me a face block instead of epidural and I thought the epidural was painful.  It did not work and I will not go back, pain still there.   Ran into my pastor at the post office, he too had a horrific experience with a very painful injection with Dr. Andersen.  Ended up finding out, the dr injured a nerve in his leg and proved by two other dr's.  Again, I like dr Andersen, but be prepared for horrific intense pain...and I hope whatever he decided to do will help you.  Had he given me the epidural, I bet I would be fine now.  I have had epidurals before and wow...it was a breeze in comparison. Going for a recommended orthapedic now.|Dr. Anderson gave me a shot for my sciatica pain & it relieved the pain.  Dr. Anderson quickly diagnosed another painful condition I have been having for two years that a chiropractor misdiagnosed.  I wish I would have met Dr. Anderson two years ago.  Dr. Anderson & all of his staff were super nice & helpful to me.|I have to say I respectfully and completely disagree with Ms. Kimbrell's opinion on Dr. Anderson. I think he completely understands pain and sympathizes with all sufferers.

I called Dr. Anthony Anderson's office to make an appointment as a new patient for my 86 year old grandmother and spoke to his receptionist, Betsy, on Monday. She was able to work my grandmother in on Wednesday of the same week. Her kindness and respect eminated through the phone and she was even sweeter in person. I took my grandmother to see Dr. Anderson last week (3/2016) after years of severe pain, now increasing as arthritis also sets in. She has been on pain meds and completed PT, but was still hurting. Like almost all doctors, they run slightly behind, but we waited only 10 minutes after completing our paperwork before we were taken into an exam room.

While we were waiting to be seen, it was apparent that the previous patient had stopped Dr. Anderson before he came into our room. She had a few more questions and was explaining her pain and its history in greater detail. (Along with stories of her pets and family :D) Dr. Anderson spoke with her and further explained different options and treatments. He did not rush her, even though her appointment was finished and we were waiting. He was sympathetic as well as empathetic with her. When she was finished you could hear the appreciation for his extra time in her voice.

When Dr. Anderson entered the exam room he was warm and kind. He listened to my grandmother explain her pain and where and when it started. He was patient and attentive while she went on and on about her dogs and her love for being outside and her gardening. (You gotta love the 86 year old ladies who love to go on and on about their pets and their plants!) He did a physical exam on her checking her range of motion in her hips, back and overall body. He asked what she would like to see change in terms of her pain, what expectations she had, and then explained different treatment options and potential outcomes. He offered no guarantees but was optimistic of a successful outcome. My grandmother decided to do a form of injections in her joints and back. I don't recall the specific procedure he wanted to start with, I want to say it was pain medicine injected into her sacroiliac joint or an SNRB (selective nerve root block). I  was prepared to schedule another appointment for the procedure but was happily surprised when he told her they would perform the procedure while we were there that day. I share these details because I'm fairly certain that making sure my grandmother went home feeling better that day was something that was important to him and it was definitely important to us. Other patients might have had to wait a few more minutes but I was grateful that he took the time to help her. Sometimes we have to wait a little longer to be seen when we go to see a specialist, but knowing they will take the time with us when it's our turn speaks to their dedication and devotion to their patients.

By 10:30 that evening my grandmother was a whole new woman! It will be a week tomorrow and she's still feeling fantastic. The office contacted us that evening to check on her status and the next day as well. We have a follow up appointment for tomorrow.

Overall, I am MORE than pleased with Dr. Anderson and his staff. My grandmother means the world to me and I feel as though I have high expectations when it comes to her healthcare and the doctors we allow to treat her. Dr. Anderson surpassed all my expectations and more.

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Anderson without hesitation or reservation! Thank you to the pain management staff for your amazing work and for bringing my fun, energetic and outgoing grandmother back to me!

A+++++

Forever grateful,
Megan Kinealy|Wasn't listening to what I was telling him. Seemed he had his mind made up that I was just looking for pain medication. Was out in the waiting room 50 min. past my appointment and then was rushed, of course, because he had 3 other people after me that had been waiting. Everyone else was terrific though. And as I suspected,  by his initial attitude, he would not prescribe any pain medication. I have already been taking something for the severe pain I have but my Dr. retired,  leaving me to find a new one. He wants to cut off all my medication and for me to do physical therapy. He obviously doesn't understand or empathize with pain sufferers.|Dr. Anderson's treatment for back pain far exceeds other pain management doctors I've seen.
I trust his opinion, and the procedures he has done on my back help tremendously.|Dr.Anderson has gone above and beyond with my elderly mother for her pain management.

I took testing in the beginning, the pain psychologist I saw did say the tests pointed to the fact that my pain is physical pain, though I have some depression & anxiety as well.

I went to the sessions, they were useless - after dealing with pain for years, I already knew all this stuff, and all the ""tips"" given. I was told in the beginning that I might do well with the Alpha-Stim but was required to go to FIVE group therapy sessions, then have follow up. There was a chance the Alpha-Stim would be offered during the sessions but that never happened. They called up today about the follow up and the earliest they could get me in was November.

She doesn't visit with you before or after the procedure.  She never explains what she's doing.  The nurses are horribly rude.

Dr. Leech is by far the most astonishing chiropractor I have ever encountered. I worked in the dental field for 15 years. I spent 15 years of my life sitting in that chai, in the same position hunching and bending over and over for eight hours a day. Let me tell you ,,,this by far took a toll on my body! Needless to say my sciatic was affecting my every day life. Some days it
literally hurt to walk!  I was in so much pain I couldn't take it anymore. I knew it was time to reach out for medical attention. I was referred to Dr. Leech through word of mouth. Working in the med/ dental field  is the best type of referral there is. Let me tell you this man has the hands of an angel! As crazy as it sounds it only took about three or four visits before I was back to myself again. He was my medication Not to mention he saved my career! If you have any kind of back pain sciatic pain ,neck, pain you MUST go see for yourself! Dr. Leech has a Understanding, humble, and down to earth bedside manner w/ healing hands of an angel!!!! Highly recommended!!!!|I had a terrible experience with them. First I went in for a consultation that went good. They scheduled a follow up appointment the next week after they got my medical file and MRI, I have to admit I was excited that I might get some relief soon.My appointment day; I showed up early and they called me in. I spent the next hour sitting waiting on the doctor. Now that would be ok if they were busy but they forgot to get my medical file from the hospital. The reason I know this is because I know people at this hospital! Then after they got it they told me that there wasnt anything they could do! And to top it all off I did a piss test for them for some reason ( Which everybody gets one they told me ) I get a Bill for $1600.00 because if they did any research on my Insurance they would know My insurance does not cover drug tests that are not medically needed! So I will be going up there to see what can be done about this! I know I'm probably one out of many but all I can say is if you are going there be careful!

Sincerely; Still in pain|Horrible! I need surgery but am told by them,  not to get surgery. I called today because I'm still in terrible pain. desperate for some relief I'm being the
That they can't help me! Screw you! My MRI clearly showed them that I'm broken. Not all of us are freaking addicts. Oh and if you have Medicaid,  you will NEVER see the doctor, only the nurse..|The entire staff here are ""EXCELLENT & KNOWLEDGEABLE "" in each of their professions!To all the ney-sayers here, you must have a record or past that these folks wish not to deal with. I been a patient here for over a year, I take my meds like I am perscribed, I don't use or abuse drugs, I don't drink, I pass all my tests, And most  importantly,I AM A PROUD CHRISTIAN! MAYBE  if those who wish to become a patient here followed this example, you to could have some of the best treatment in this  state, that being THE A.P.I.|I love it here the staff is always nice and they really do care about you! I was hit by a car and they saw me the very next day, a day they don't normally see patients!! I had to use a walker for a while but now it's been a month since I have used it!!!!|I never wait long for a doctor here my appointments are always kept promptly! The staff was courteous friendly knowledgeable... To be honest I wouldn't go anywhere else or even think of it!|Great doctors and staff. Do all they can to help you!

I loved the doctors and NPs! So nice and friendly they are very knowledgeable and try to get to the root of the issues!! So very thankful for Branson Neurology!!|They canceled my appointment because i was 6 min. late.  Asked me if i wanted to reschedule, after already handing me an appointment card for a month and a half out.  Now I have to go and take pain pills for another month and a half to wait and see if they will even be able to help me.  No wonder people result to the drugs, where are the actual health care professionals?  Six minutes?  Shame on you people, you could have at least told me you were gonna cancel on me when I called ahead to let you know I was running behind.  I hope this never happens to any of them.|I would have to agree with most the reviews on here! I have never been treated the way I was treated in this office. I think the problem is the doctor mostly. I've never known a doctor to just attack someone, but it really seemed like he was attacking me. He literally told me that because I was a single mother on Medicaid that was why I was there at his office. I think I was in the shock for the rest of the meeting. I don't think I'm going to take the medications he referred me to have and I don't trust him. I would find a different neurologist one who knows how to be empathetic not just read brain scans. Pain is debilitating and for someone to attack your struggle and tell you it's not there it's probably one of the worst feelings in the entire world. It seems to be a theme with him too.

Edit* just want to make sure everybody knows I never got an apology letter or anything of the sort but I did get a letter saying that he was leaving the office so I don't know if they saw my review or if he left for some other reason but the doctor that saw me is no longer there.

As far as the office went everybody seemed okay I went in pretty quick so I can't really attest to the other doctors that might be working here. I know the one specific one I saw was not great.|I see Doctor Corneilson every time I go!  She has helped my back and neck pain immensely!  She is very aware of my other health issues, and has still found ways to help my pain, when others couldn't!  The staff here are wonderful very caring people.  I see her 4 times a year, and she has always been available if I need to come in between visits.|A no nonsense team of professionals. They deal all day with folks in pain and those folks can get cranky. I know.  I have personally used this clinic for my pain and neurological problems for the last 20 years. They treat you like family and listen to you. And even on their worst days they are still friendly and compassionate. Highly recommend.|I was there today for the first time. Others had warned me that they were rude, but, i gave them a chance.  I have been on pain meds for 5 years. I have never abused them, never failed a urine test. I've never done any form of drugs in my life. Pain meds were a miracle to me, when I finally was able to get relief, after years and years of suffering. I have sever chronic pain. My regular doctor had to cut down my meds because of Federal Regulations. I go to the Pain clinic, thinking they might be able to give me the needed amount of meds so I can get back to quality of life that I had before. Or at least, help me at all. When I was on my full script of meds, i was able to work, play with my Grandkids, walk farther, clean house, etc. Since getting cut down, I am barely able to do my housework. Can't take any trips because of pain, can't shop because of too much walking. Just ruined the quality of my life, so now I suffer most hours of the day, and barely sleep.
So, when I went in there today, there was no introduction. The first words out of Dr Cornelius mouth was, if you're looking for euphoria from meds, we can't help you. I said what? I'm looking for help. Well, being as over weight as you are, that is why you are in so much pain. And if your just looking for pills, you should consider goin to a doctor who just does pain management. I thought Cox Pain and Neurology was that???? I have never been so humiliated in my life. So embarrassed because of my weight, and made to feel like a drug addict. I've never even seem drugs. Besides my meds. I don't know what happened to beside manner, or at least treating people with some sort of compassion . I cried almost the whole appointment and cried all the way home, now upset again just thinking of how I was treated. I'm getting the xrays done she ordered, but that's it. I'm getting referred to a different doctor. If you didn't truly want to help people, and think everyone is a dope head, then you shouldn't have become a doctor. I have sever depression and sever panic attacks, and after today, i had a massive panic attack right after I got home. I felt so bad about myself after leaving there, that, I don't even know what to do. I absolutely never write reviews, but I can't imagine treating people who are suffering already every day of their life this way. Anyway, the rest of the staff was very nice. I'm shattered and broken.|This clinic is so busy they loose communication from the medicine count room to the actual room where nurse practioner greer see you. Dr. Cornelison is hardly ever there and lets mary ann greer run her practice. I have perfect marks on my record no early refills no always in count with medicines. I was knocked down on my pain patch from .75mcg to 50mcg because i did not do a sleep study. Greer said safety safety safety. I was taking the same amount of medicine for 11 years. I pleaded with her before doing such a harsh thing consult my primary care physician or phyciatrist first she said she did not have to. So feeling vulnerable and with no choice i took her reducation but almost had a heart attack. I do not trust this office they do not read records and dont care about your pain. Please use caution before trusting this office. My pcp said they almost killed me and suggusted i never go there again. I know how hard it is to find a good pain doctor but this is branson detox center and dont care what happens to you my pcp said a 10 percent reducation would of been humane they chose a 33.3% reduction instead. Like i say use caution and im a good patient.|The last time I saw Diane C was because I was scheduled for an epidural.

My neurologist recommended me to him. I was hoping a neck surgery would help me more than it did. The burning nerve pain is all that it helped though unfortunately. I guess you can't Cut, Glue and Paste your way out of degenerative disk disease. Stinks. But I'm so happy with Dr. Knudsen and the nursing and clinical staff. I've been treated kind and respectfully. Do unto others I guess. I'm so sorry the powers that be has caused a rift between the pain patients and pain physicians in our society. It's sad. Blaming everyone but themselves. Doctors and patients live or suffer  by the rules. They don't make the rules. The ones that dont have any skin in the game and yet gain the most are the rule makers. Politics and big money. Always mess up stuff. Sick. Online pills are illegal medicine. Shouldn't be in the discussion. You can't get fentenyl outside a hospital setting legally. Shouldn't be in the discussion. Don't complain on review boards about a doctor please? Call your state Rep. or Congressman. Make them change the discussion. To real and truthful statements.
Like we don't have an opioid crisis!! We have a morality crisis!!
Nobody shoved a pill down anyone's throat.
That's assault and attempted or actual murder. Right? They took legal scripts illegally or illegal scripts to their own demise!! Which is also illegal. Suiside by pills is a crime. The misinformation is effecting us pain patients horribly. It makes me sick and disgusted at supposedly smart people that are in power. Also those whom are to cowardly to stand up to them.
Atleast there are courageous doctors still helping us poor pain suffers. Be thankful as I am there are good humans left. Thank God for the ones relieving suffering and not causing more. Thanks again. Keep up the good fight. Don't blame the wrong people. Spread truth and goodness with love for others.|This is the most caring, attentive, and professional pain relief location in the Joplin area. For 2yrs, I have sought help concerning injury from pain and Dr. Knudsen and his staff have been incredible at addressing the issues, solving for relief, and long-term care planning. The front office staff is the best. They are personable and understanding to patient needs and working with you. The nursing staff is also top notch. They are professionals that seek to assist the doctor in caring for the patient. And the doctor himself, he has been amazing at maintaining a month-to-month care plan, as well as long term options to address the pain.
Fantastic place.
-Andrew|After three years of passing urine tests, being oncount with the medication and being on time, I made the mistake of being honest and telling them I tested positive for covid five days earlier as I was sitting on their parking lot. The older nurse said she would not make an appointment for me until I got a letter from my Dr. releasing me. Two days later with the letter in hand , I called and she set it for the 12th which was 12 days with no medication. I went in on the 6th and ask her if they could get me in earlier or even get me in with a cancellation. She just kept saying ""we'll call you.
I made the mistake of saying that ""if I would have not been honest in telling them I tested positive I would have got my medication, but I'm not like that.""
Seeing they have no policy with patients that call in sick but to make them wait two weeks or more for an opening, tells me that the office could be a hotbed of infectious people who would keep quiet rather than go without medication and be in severe pain  for two weeks. I'm disappointed that Dr. Knudson  did not have some type of policy that would allow sick patients to be treated sooner. When I told the older nurse my prescription was up the following day and I was out of medication she made the comment that when I found out I was positive I should have spaced out my pills. Really! I had four left, how do you space that out over 12 days. And isn't that a violation of my contract to take them as prescribed. Today when she called and told me to come in and get my prescription I thought Dr was going to see me, but no. She haded me the prescription and a letter telling me he was dropping me. ..|Just because I'm young, Knudsen treated me as a pill seeker. I have multiple chronic illnesses that cause a lot of pain, and at 21 I am desperately looking for some quality of life. I expressed to him my pain and how I'm  tired of crying and hurting all the time and just wanted relief whatever it takes. Hes Very rude, short and seems as if not interested. Appointments last no more than 10-15 minutes and the majority of the time is him filling out paperwork in a very unsettling awkward silence. I got a Steroid/epidural injection in my back, which I was basically forced to do, and had a allergic reaction and it still didn't help the pain, honestly just made it worse. I informed him of this, and he basically called me a Liar! Worst experience EVER. The only thing pleasant about his office we're his nurse and the front desk girl!|Ok I wouldn't want anyone to go to him .

Spot on with the one  review. Seems like the doctor of whom I havent met but insurance paid for the highly overpriced visits for a doctor I never seem. scheduled in 3 appts within six weeks. Not one thing addressed at $995.00 let
me sit never saw  him until the last five min there N I had five minutes after complaint for for the 3+ hour wait.They made me do a urine test each visit. The final appt despite my Chicago Doctor calling with my referral etc ETC ETC.. six months to get in so I have been bedridden from Jan to June. Last apt was at 1030. Being new to Tennessee I was lost all the time so I called for direction. My appt on phone vm said 1030am. Come 2pm . N second waiting area since 1045. I use the restroom to only see his feet up on desk taking on the phone n laughing. So here I am thinking wth is going on come 130 I see all these people who are coming and being seen before me I question this. They said my appt is at 330 lol lol . I played recording on vm I was right Dr Walks n from other room n says what's your problem lol. And without my chart and years of records for pain management yada yada. He says and I quote ""I will only cut you here n here n do on saying I need 7 surgeries. I said I know but I live alone in middle of no where with no help n asked about Dr who referred me with all the records sent. I had in ten years n surgeries. That mtrfkr said please follow me as I'm crying in pain n he totally pushed me out the office! To this day they cannot help me not one office. They all treat me like an addict or something A brick wall. But funny at every place they sent me filled with patients they all said they were there for a refill. I had few at several places often to sell them at ten or more a piece. OMG see them are the people who's screwing real patients n selling them a supply and demand
drug dealers but me I get grown pretty|Dr Schmidt is a great doctor. He listens to you and helps you with the right treatment.
He told me to get a MRI because, he knew something was wrong wrong with me.
Come to find out  I need  survey on my neck, front and back. Or I would become paralyzed.|I've been a patent for many years.  He, and his staff are awesome.  I have read the reviews that many Have posted.  If waiting longer than expected is such a problem, then seek a different, less qualified Dr.  Your wait in their office may be shorter, maybe not.  However, you will never find a Dr as skilled as Dr Schmidt.  Nor will you receive the relief for your pain that comes with the privilege of having Dr Schmidt as a Dr.|I have been going to the Washington office for 2plus years.   They take good care of me.   All the staff are caring and professional.   The injections have helped me allot.   But I try to be active.  Dr Schmidt is a very good doctor.   You have to talk to him and let them know what's wrong.   It's a busy place but I am thankful he comes to our town.|Arguably the worst medical facility I've ever come into contact with. I am a licensed trauma nurse and have never in my entire career seen a group of more unprofessional or uncaring medical providers. My mother was a patient of theirs and was dropped before she was able to receive a procedure that would have helped her long term acute pain. She was told by medical staff 2 hours before the procedure that in order for them to go through with it, she would have to get a workup done explaining why she had previously had an episode of low blood pressure. After scrambling at the last minute and receiving a workup from a physician at urgent care, she was turned down by Dr. Schmidt because the workup ""was't good enough."" Mind you, this information was given to my mother last minute and she had been needing this surgery for months. When she called them arguably furious, she was dropped as a patient. If you are thinking of becoming a patient of Stephen Schmidt, don't. He's a robotic medical provider at best and a heartless individual at worst. Wendy, one of the members of his staff, is no better. I was present when I heard her talk to my mother and father and could not believe the disrespect she showed both of them. Her judgmental, arrogant, and condescending remarks regarding my mother's condition were entirely out of place for someone so uneducated in her field. If there were ever two medical ""professionals"" who should consider leaving the field immediately due to their very apparent lack of care for patients and utter lack of respect, it would be Stephen Schmidt and Wendy.|I only rate this as a 1 for the service. Appointment at 1:00. Don't get in the room until an hour or more later. Wait for doctor for another half an hour or more. Put another patient ahead of my husband. The chairs are hard and uncomfortable to be waiting that long. Staffing is nice. For the money you pay should have better sitting and  need more better scheduling appointments  than trying to see how many people that they can get in one day or be over in this area more than one day through the week or have another doctor to help with the over load. Should be more considerate of the patient's time too.|I was seen within 15 minutes and I saw the doctor within 30 minutes from my arrival.  Dr. Schmidt took his time during this consultation to hear my concerns and help me find the best possible treatment.  I have chronic pain and there aren't many doctors who treat that anymore, so I'm grateful for dr. Schmidt!",2024-01-06|2023-11-17|2024-01-05|2022-06-09|2019-01-28|2021-05-19|2020-01-15|2020-03-03,5|1|5|5|5|1|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJZVK3r3nS2IcRjNNbshlu0BU,31

I hurt so much I spend most of my time in bed. Dr Gunaputti took in everything I had to say and answer questions with an impeccable bedside manner. That is a rare trait. We are still searching pain options, 30 years of continuous damage is hard to fix. He was kind and could see it on my face. How much pain I'm constantly in. He didn't talk to me like I was stupid, he took my experience being a paramedic, and spoke to me on that level. I would definitely recommend!!|I have been a patient of Dr. Gunapooti for about 15 years. He is a great Dr. and a kind person.

He is very accurate and confident in his procedures.  as much pain as im in normally walking in the office its always a pleasant peaceful environment with great personable staff throughout the clinic.  I highly recommend Dr Gunapooti and trust his decisions in giving me the best care he can.|Dr. Gunapooti is great along with his PA's I would still give his staff a 5 star, except there's ALWAYS one that CLEARLY doesn't have any people skills and extremely rude and just ignorant and uncouth on the phone!

One day their mothers and grandmothers are going to be in this same position and there's not going to be any care providers around to help as well they may even have someone worse than her and treat them the same way!

After talking with 2 people and leaving a message that prescription was not called in to be filled. Problems with the automated text for confirmation that you will make your appointment and charging consultation visits as office visits. I really have doubts about this origination's integrity. I'm sure they will try to charge for a missed appointment tomorrow morning due to them failing to do there job.|I saw Dr. Boenefeld after my pain management Dr. in town told me to start on marijuana. A person who works every day can't be high. He put me on a pain patch and it worked well. He also burned my nerves in my back which was a great help with my pain. He was very good, found all my problems and found a way to treat me without pills. He was refreshing. I would recommend him to anyone. I don't see him now because of a change in my financial situation. But I can return at any time and if need be I will. He was great.|After living here 2.5 years and having zero luck finding a doctor to help me, Dr Bodefield has been a godsend. I've had an extensive surgical history and no other doctors in the area have been willing to help. I've had two visits so far and he has been attentive, sympathetic and extremely helpful in every regard. Since moving here from NC in 2019 I can say without a doubt that Dr Bodefield has been the best physician experience I've had so far in this area. This doctor is definitely a 10/10 no matter what other reviews state.|I had an awful experience! After waiting for a month for my initial appointment, I arrived and found out that they had scheduled me to their ""wrong"" office and needed to reschedule at one of their other offices. After finally getting in to my initial appointment I had to wait in the waiting room for 90 minutes before seeing the doctor. When I finally saw him, he examined me for 7-8 minutes and said, ""it's just nerve pain"" and prescribed medication from a family of medicines that have already been prescribed and didn't work. Moreover, my other doctors have said there was no point in ordering it for me since other similar medications hadn't worked. The worst were that there was not one attempt to apologize for being 90 minutes late, much less scheduling me to the ""wrong"" office, nor did there seem to be any attempt on Dr. Boedefeld's part to try and understand my pain.|This doctor was so rude and treated my wife Like some type of street trash my wife is a Iraq vet who was injured by a IED And is now disabled and has to use canes and walkers to even walk 10 feet and he and his staff just treated her so horribly and don't even ask how long we waited.but he had the nerve to tell her that she didn't need medication but instead shots in her back and legs and he wouldn't listen to her at all and it made me so mad cause when my wife is hurting so bad that she is crying all night and I have to carry her to a salt bath and hold her cause of how much pain she is in. It's a shame that because of drug addicts abusing these doctors that now they all treat everyone like a drug addict and it hurts the people who are really in pain and suffering.

My husband has ankle and leg problems and is now walking better than I've ever seen. I have an autoimmune disease and have problems with all my joints and so we've begun treatment on my low back and I feel better each and every day. My sciatic pain is reduced, I can bend over without pain, and my muscle spasms have all but disappeared.

I will always be a client here from now on.|We've been going to this clinic for 3 years. Recently they changed staffing around and increased patient load substantially to an unsafe level where they are just shoving people in and out. My mom went to Pain Stop Clinic to get lidocaine injections for back pain. The N.P. assigned to give her injections that particular day used too big of a needle WITH MY MOTHER TELLING HER IT WAS TOO BIG. My mom is a nurse and been in the medical field for over 30 years, she knows what she's talking about. The NP ignored her comment and gave her the injection with the inch long needle anyway. Within an hour of my mom being home, she knew something was not right and went to urgent care right away. At urgent care she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance because the NP punctured her lung and it was now deflated. She spent three days in the hospital with a chest tube. After further investigation of this NP in the Pain Stop Clinic, turns out she's a pediatric nurse!
We have reported them to the BBB and the Board of Nursing. No other patients need to be hurt from this pathetic practice. This clinic should be out of business and shut down immediately.|I came to Pain Stop with shoulder, elbow, and wrist issues that were making it difficult for me to perform normal tasks at work.

Great staff that truly cares about your rehabilitation and well-being.|Horrible.  Turn and walk away.  There is no treatment to help you improve just office visits to make them money.

I've been seeing him for well over 10years and since the day I've met Dr. Swarm we have been tackling my health issues together!!! I will honestly say Dr. Swarm listens when you talk to  him and that's one of the first things I love about him. I like all the staff in the office their so nice!!! Great environment!!!|Dr Swarms talks me through the injection putting my mind at ease.  The shots for the last 15 years have all gave me relief.  Thank you so much Dr Swarm and staff.
I did have a different  doctor from Belleville give me a shot, my blood pressure spiked to around 220/90  i walk out of his office very worried and nervous.|At first I really liked Dr. Swarm. He was personable and great at listening, for the first time it felt like someone was understanding how I was feeling. After less than 6 months and 2 prescriptions (mild/non habit forming ones at that) he told me that I should take aspirin, because if those weren't working, aspirin was my best option.

What a waste of time/co-pay/insurance and everything else on a doctor who was satiated trying 2 drugs.|On May 24, 2018; Dr. Swarm performed a botched surgery on my Mother, Tammy Nadeau. She was suppose to receive a pain pump to alleviate pain. Dr. Swarm, during surgery, punctured her spinal cord. For 3 days after surgery, my Mother was unable to walk or even use the bathroom. Her abdomen filled with fluid. Concerned we demanded answers. Dr. Swarm finally came to my mother's room and he explained that he ""screwed up"". He stated that he only went in to her intercostal space 2x and the MRI showed that he had punctured her spinal cord. Have that on video. Funny, medical records show that he went in FOUR TIMES. Medical records even showed how he tried editing both the surgical report and the MRI report to reflect that she did not have a spinal cord injury.
Multiple videos with not only Dr. Swarm admitting she had a spinal cord injury but also other doctors stating that ""this side effect and that side effect was due to the spinal cord injury from surgery"".

My Mother WALKED in to that hospital....but never walked out. For nearly 6 months after surgery, she was in excruciating pain. The staff at the hospital failed to.turn and reposition her which caused her to have a pressure ulcer.

Exactly 6 months from the day of surgery (October 24, 2018), I brought my Mom home on hospice after the infection from the bed wound went down to her bone (osteomyilitis), and her lungs and abdomen kept filling up with fluid despite multiple drainings.
My Mother passed away November 3, 2018.

Dr. Swarm, you will never truly know what you have taken from us. You will never know how.much you have negatively impacted my family. You had the audacity to lie...LIE to my Mother's face about how many times you entered her spinal canal. You paralyzed a patient and then proceeded to cover it up by editing medical records. Trust me. I have the unedited versions.

I've contacted Joint Commisions and the medical review board for physicians. And not only a full investigation on your conduct regarding editing medical records but also on your competency during surgery that ended with catastrophic results.

Although I believe ""accidents to happen"", I also believe in being HONEST enough to admit the WHOLE truth to your patient as well as not editing medical records. That, Sir, is where you become dishonest. And a disgrace to the medical community. People put their trust in medical professionals to do their best. I would ask you if you did your best with Tammy Nadeau (my Mother); but also realize that you have already been proven a liar not once but twice so do not expect an honest answer.

Do not trust your loved one or even your enemy with this doctor.|I think Dr. Swarm is an excellent doctor & he listens to everything you tell him about yourself & he helps you out as much as possible.|See Healthgrades Detailed Review posted earlier this month regarding

Im not sure why they still require masks because they clearly don't care if you are infectious or not. Place is so shady anymore, most places in Poplar Bluff no longer fill scripts anyway.|Just found out that a Dr. Scott in PB that my elderly and disabled mother saw for her intractable and untreated chronic pain and nerve damage in her lower spine recommended this place. Thanks for the heads up with the reviews. My mom is fragile and has dementia. She is declining and all I wanted is for her to have a little bit of a quality of life before she passes. Places like this Advanced Pain clinic have zero empathy and the reviews tell me that.. She can't sit for long in waiting rooms and she is unable to control her emotions. She is suffering a slow and painful death and none of her doctors care. Obviously, since Dr. Scott recommended this place and it's bottom line is money. Heartbreaking.|Wife's regular doctor wants her to see a pain management specialist. They faxed a referral to these quacks twice, bother times whoever the rude female receptionist is denied that they ever received them.

The rude woman who answered the phone said they can't do it like that and once again denied ever receiving a fax from the regular doctor...my wife had stood there and WATCHED the fax being sent. My wife started to ask here HOW she could get an appointment  and the woman hung up on her! I won't let her go to this ignorant so-called ""doctor"" even if they begged after being treated so rudely! I'd read numerous bad reviews on them but we're trying to get an appointment closer to where we live and figured we'd at least give them a chance but no chance of that now!|Dr. Essmeyer, Frank, and all the ladies are fantastic. They take complete care of me and treat my particular needs. They don't put me in a box and treat me like just like everyone else, because my pain is not the same as others. I've been impressed with them since I started going 5 months ago.|Beware of this place as they tell all their employees to push Injections because they get more money for injections than they do if you just want your regular pain meds...Even if you do not need them they will insist.....You have the right to say NO!    Also beware that the computer randomly calls someone in each month for a pill count about two weeks after you got them...if you do not have the right amount...then do not answer your phone or you will be cut off.....this place is such a scam.

At one point Dr. had some medical issues (from what I understand) and was out for 2 months. We were left on our own to find a doctor that would write our scripts while he was on leave. No problem, I found a doctor that would do that for me, even though it cost me an extra $250 a month to see a different doctor. In the middle of the second month, I ran into one of his staff at a restaurant. I ask her if Dr Knudsen was doing better, she said she wasn't sure, I asked her if she thought the doctor would be back and she said she wasn't sure I asked her if I I should go to another doctor that I had been referred to and had called me. She said she would. She didn't have a good feeling about it so I went to a new doctor. They never called me from Dr. Newton's office to schedule an appointment or anything the doctor I was seeing closed down and I called Dr. Newton's office to see if I could get back in and I was told I had been dismissed and I could not come back Even though his nurse told me to find another doctor. I don't think that's fair practice.|I have read the other reviews and my experience was vastly different from what others have described. Let me start with the staff. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and professional.  There was not one single bad thing to say. The nurse was very friendly and seemed eager to help in any way she could. My exam room was clean and decorated  with pictures from Colorado  and very inviting. The Doctor was jovial and listened to what I had to say. Besides my contract and

Conversation regarding pain he was nice and I enjoyed talking to him. He was very firm when it came to the pain Co and I think he needed to be that way. I will see him every thirty days and will look forward to my visit. It sounds like we were seeing a completely different Dr. As for me I sure would Refer Dr. Knudsen.|Was his patient for 3 years, never missed an appointment, always passed UAs, and was right on pull count. The problem?, I was sick and tested positive for Covid 5 days prior to my appointment that was on the 29th. I went on the 29th and sat in the parking lot hoping to talk to him via the program that was setup for the Covid isolation period. The nurse said they weren't doing that anymore. To make a long story short. They dropped me for being sick even tho I complied with her request in getting a release from my health provider. They have no policy for rescheduling you when sick except to make you wait untill they fit you in, general about two weeks. I asked her what was I suppose to do for the pain with only one day left of medication, and she replied that I should have spaced them out when I found out I had Covid. . She was telling me to do something that violated my contract.  This clearly is not pain management, but more like manage your own pain. That office could be a hotbed for sickness if people know they will have to wait at least 2weeks before seeing the DR. or get dropped. They will come to their appointment sick rather than take that chance. And by the way when I was called into the office, I got my prescription from the nurse along with the goodbye letter, without seeing Dr. Knudson. So why couldn't I be given the prescription when I came in with my release.|If less stars could be given I would. The whole office from secretary to the doctor are horrible. He doesn't care about you one but. He only cares himself. You never know what amount he says your supposed to have left when he counts. Also don't have one too many that's the same as not taking it's a prescribed in his opinion. You will be treated like everything except a human being in this clinic. I would rather choose to have to go cold turkey off narcotics and be sick than ever return to this office.|I wish that I could give both him and his office less than one star. If I could, I would. Neither himself or his staff has any care for their patients and it is seriously questionable if he really knows what he is doing. I provided information to him to help him help me and he ignored it. Not to mention that he kept forcing one specific type of medicine on me.
He will precribe you what he thinks is best, not what you really need and then has your next appointment scheduled for whenever. When you come in for that next appointment you had better have however many pills he thinks you should have, no matter how many you needed.
Also you had better not be sick and miss an appointment due to that, or he will drop you as a patient without warning making you go through withdrawals due to the drugs he has you taking.|I believe this is a great Dr's Office,  the nurses are great, The Dr is great. I never have a long wait to see the Dr and he's a very  knowledgeable Dr, I would recommend anyone to This Dr's office, I enjoy all that I come in contact with. I've read a lot of reviews that talk bad , But if you go to this Dr's office you will see none of this bad stuff here. I have not seen anything like what I have read.|I've been coming here for almost 2 years. Everyone is always friendly. They are extremely serious with the scripts and being right on the count that you should have. If you take them like he prescribes them then you'll never be short. He is a very ice man and cares deeply for his patients. But doesn't tolerate any misuse. It jeopardizes his practice to where he can't practice or help anyone anymore.  He has been doing this for a long time and he will always try the least addictive or less side effects first. You have to have a starting point. He truly listens and cares if you are sincere, and honest that is the best thing for you so he can help. Read your contract, and don't miss appointments.|I have never been treated do rudely by a nurse!  Asked if urinalysis was needed this visit no one could answer me ,up to dr they said so I made statement that I was going to bathroom rather than pee my pants. When I got done with dr the nurse accused me of hollering at her and threatened me with telling dr.

She also gave my husband injections 2 yrs ago and he hasn't needed to go back. She really does know what she is doing. Again, thank you.|Very disappointing experience, I waited 6 weeks for the appointment (no biggie, pretty common). Waitied 2 hours past my appointment time for the doctor to literally spend 4-5 minutes with me then only offer injections as a option. They received my PA 11/27 and still hadn't contacted me to schedule. Called yesterday, they are now booking into January. Patient care seems to be a low priority, more about overbooking appointments. Very frustrating as Dr. Sanders came highly recommended. I will be searching elsewhere.|The staff at this office is phenomenal. The receptionists, the nurses, the nurse practitioners and Dr. Sanders herself are so kind. I can tell that they really care about me. I would highly recommend to anyone.|Dr. Rebecca Sanders boy oh boy so much negative things I want to say. Her nurse spend more time with me than she did. So props to her, thank you, i'm glad you cared enough!!!!!! The Dr. She didn't bother to look me over didn't act like she cared. Handed me a paper took me to get 8hrs of sleep and 3 meals a day. Like, I don't already do that, lady. Actually, I get 10hrs. I like really lady I have pinch nerves It's my legs go numb when I sit down for too long. They go numb when I stand up for too long. They twitch when I drive. All of my med paperwork say no pain pills period because I don't want them. I've had 3 surgeries that I didn't even have pain. Meds after dr thought i was nuts. My thing is when a patient comes to you for help. You're supposed to help them, but no, and they want to base it off your age, and they don't want to help you. Or they just want to help period because be time they get to you they are sick of dealing with people you get the short end of the stick.... my opinion if you don't want to help why did you become a doctor in the first place. Because in my opinion, she needs to get a better bedside manner and help her patients. Because a patient that chooses to change a doctor because instead of someone driving an hour and a half, because they're having problems and rather change to drive twenty five minutes, a doctor should understand she shouldn't be hateful, and spend less than a minute and 30 seconds with a patient. And they wonder why doctors like this get lawsuits. And we won't even get started the ladies at the front desk.. let's just say everybody in that office. Needs Jesus|Dr. Sanders, claims and write ups about her that she care so much about the patient those claims are false! DR Sanders came into the room with a medical device that she wanted to implant which is a wire that touches the nerve that connects to a battery which is so crazy she even said in about a year the battery should be a third smaller and this battery was about a 3-inch square. She does not prescribe pain meds whatsoever! This woman only sells her patience medical procedures where she gets paid quite a bit! She is part of the medical systems problem in not helping people with severe chronic pain. Not all of us chronic pain patience are seeking drugs we are all being victimized because some people have drug issues she needs to step down as a pain management doctor as well as some of these surgeons that want to cut you open and not treat you and keep you comfortable while you are recovering I'm a victim of that as well!|Had an appointment for a lower back injection they told me to call if it didn't work after 10 to 14 days I called back after 14 days and waited for almost 2 weeks longer and still no call back so I called apparently I was supposed to get 2 injection and was never told but did get informed that I couldn't handle the 2nd injection they said i did really good and never said anything about the 2nd one.Do these people even know what is going on?|Dr.Sanders and all her staff are the most caring people. Never been treated so well. She stayed on my pain and I had some relief. Continue my planned treatment and looking forward to being pain free.|I had a great experience. Dr. Sanders was able to order images and diagnose the problem with my spine and get me into a neurosurgeon in a timely manner.  I have since gotten some diagnostic spinal injections to further determine my future plan of care and provide me with a great amount of relief in the meantime.  I am very satisfied with my care.",2024-11-29|2024-12-11|2024-12-04|2024-12-10|2024-08-14|2025-02-12|2024-03-13|2022-05-17,5|1|5|1|1|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJt-PlYdd6yIcRKnpJ-O5dY6E,18

My first pain-relief epidural injection to the spine by Doctor Kneeland that was absolutely, completely Painless !   In the past, at different facilities with different Doctors they were painful. Twice I screamed for them to pause as the injection was intensely painful.  My experience today was WILDLY different. Finished in about 10 minutes or less. When long-endured  pain is instantly relieved it can make you suddenly cry and today I almost did. My voice quivered but I did not cry. I read and disagreed with a few negative reviews posted here. Pain Doctors have lawful protocols they are forced to follow, they can not grant your wish to jump to what ""you"" know you need. I've researched pain management using the Internet and it's exciting, the new technology that's being explored and tested.
Deeper research reveals pain management protocols. In my case I shared my research with Doctor Kneeland, he listened and was not dismissive. He explained the protocol steps that MUST be tried first.  He explained that I could be pleasantly surprised but if these steps fail there are more to try and that included the new technology I mentioned. He is literally in training in regards to this new technology-based pain management. I have been in severe pain since 2009 or 15 years. It has stolen the last of my youth as this year I turned 65. I expressed my goals to Dr Kneeland... I  desperately (hope)  to ride a horse again deep into those majestic Montana mountains and camp by a river, alone with my horse, the Stars and God.  I desperately (hope)   to ski those fresh powder slopes again at Sunrise & later at Sunset.  ( I have that hope. )
I am back home in Montana, I can see our Mountains everyday. I am about 30 minutes from Glacier Nat'l Park.  My youth is gone but I have (hope)  to ride a horse and to ski a slope one more time after getting to know Dr. Kneeland.  My body and my soul were both deeply grateful today for his years of medical training dedication and motivation towards pain management. As a doctor his training never ends as Technologies change almost every year now. I would encourage every patient to remember.. be patient and allow the doctor to follow protocols as he is required by law to do. You've been patient this long don't give up (hope)  now!  There are brand new revolutionary Technologies that are being tested as we speak and with one of those new technologies he is in training, practicing so that one day he can apply them to his practice, to his patients. Please have patience and always have (hope!).  Did you know that hope is the very definition of life as we all hope for things, us older, elderly folks (hope)  for one more day just one more day. Be patient & always, always ( HOPE )|I've had 2 wonderful doctors, 1 awesome counselor, and one very unhelpful bandaid doctor at this clinic. Dr. Proctor is probably my favorite I saw him twice and he has been the only doctor who went through my medical history to determine what could be a possible cause to my mysterious chronic pain and sent me in the right direction. Dr. Coles on the other hand spent almost 3 years putting me on different antidepressants instead of listening to my pleas to find the root of the issue. Adding random medications to treat symptoms of an illness that isn't know is like puting a bandaid on a bullet wound instead of figuring out how to properly treat the issue. My mom should not have had to tell her off to get me diagnostic imaging or a referral in the right direction. Kind of a waste of money.|Bad communication, practice and ethics. Spoke to Dr just 2 months ago for appointment and everything was fine asked for an injection which was the point of getting the VA to authorize seeing these people on top of medication but they stalled and said VA will have to put in another consult when I still had 2 months left of coverage , makes no sense they care about money that's all. To make it worse I was called 2 days before my medication refill and was cut off just randomly . Not only is this not safe and bad practice but the medication and amount I was on needs to be tapered off along with preventive medication so I don't withdrawal for a week. Some of us have families and jobs to up keep. Would not recommend Kneeland and his staff . I am surprised they don't have multiple lawsuits against this place for bad practice and increasing chances of serious health complications for their acts!|I have been a patient for 4 years and Eric Belanger  PA.. is by far the worst pain management provider I have ever had to see.  I had no choice when my previous pain management Dr. Kelly walker was no longer practicing medicine for Logan health..|I am currently a patient at Logan Health Pain Management in Kalispell, MT.  I am on permanent disability.  I was given a prescription for a pain medication but due to a shortage was given only a partial prescription.  When I was out of the medication I called my pharmacy for a refill for the rest of the medication and was informed that the shortage continued and the medication could not be filled.  The pharmacy told me to call the pain management provider to have an alternative pain medication prescribed and sent to their pharmacy for me to pick up.  I did this and talked to pain management staff at the Kalispell office on 07/09/3024.  I was advised they would not write a prescription for an alternative pain medication and instructed me to attempt to locate another pharmacy that did not have a shortage and go there for a refill. I live in Whitefish and my pharmacy is half a mile away from my home.  Locating a different pharmacy would require me to drive to Kalispell.  I am currently on disability and am low income.  My wife drives our car to work every day so I do not have access to a vehicle to drive to Kalispell or the means to get a ride there.  I explained this to the pain management staff and explained that I would need an alternative prescription called into my pharmacy in Whitefish.  The staff member told me this would not be happening and that I would need to find a prescription in Kalispell.  I once again explained this was not an option for me to to my disability and financial hardship.  The staff members said they would not be calling an alternative prescription to my pharmacy in Whitefish and hung up on me. I am currently out of my pain medication and am in great pain.  I am greatly concerned about the amount of pain I am in as there appears to be no remedy from the pain management center.  I am also worried that I am going to go into withdrawals as the medication is a narcotic and I have been taking it daily for several years and have now been without it for over 14 hours.  I feel the pain management office is acting unethically by not allowing me access to needed pain medication and due to my disability and financial issues am not able to remedy the situation without their assistance.|One word Cruel.  I went there for pain management and took an X-ray and immediately they kicked me to orthopedic which is booked out forever with no help with pain management until my orthopedic appointment. They dropped me like a hot potato with no concern for the agony that I am going through, in fact they acknowledged it with total indifference.|Before I came to see Dr.kneeland I was unable to use my hands to hold even the simplest things as a cell phone. I felt like I was walking on glass 24/7 and desperately needed the help from a pain management doctor, who was going to treat me like a human versus just a number!! Jessica his assistant was just amazing! She has always treating me with the upmost respect, love and care that would be expected from an office!  I've never had problems getting an appointment with the front office, and I've never ever been treated unkindly!  I can't think Dr. Kneeland enough for all his hard work to give me back some of the life life that I lost!!
Today would also like to reach out and thank Libby at the front desk for helping me with paperwork and Dr. kneeland for taking the time to help them. Also, Jessica, you are totally amazing and Dr. kneeland you're all right..
much love to all of you and I'll see you soon!

Patricia Grant|I guess you love ''em or you hate 'em. I've had back problems since I was 23. I am turning 59 this year. I've been to this clinic before and left. Very unhappy with my treatment for years. I've come back and have been to two appointments and am being treated worse  than the last time. They might as well be a cult as far as I'm concerned. They hear what they want and are extremely patronizing and belittling. I did this to please another doctor did my best to keep an open mind. I'm sorry but I feel even worse about them then when I left about 5 years ago. If you have chronic pain and have been thru everything you can try they won't help you. As far as they're concerned you don't want help or just want pain killers. They are very judgmental if you say you've done that repeatedly. You haven't tried them they are better than anybody.

Dr. Spence made no promises but fielded all my questions over multiple phone calls. I appreciated his candor, transparency, and patience. I knew this procedure might be a long, but I needed help so I went for it. My NP took great care of me and explained every procedure each time I went in. I made sure to follow the diet recommendations to a T and the added bonus was losing 20 pounds in 3 months. The icing on that cake was that just about 90-100 days after my first shot, I finally began to experience relief from my low back pain. Dr. Spence had said it would almost be as if I woke up one day and wondered where my pain went. That is what happened. I went from a daily 8-9 on the pain scale (getting to the point of unable to move, doubled over in pain, or almost vomiting by the mid-afternoon) to waking up in low level pain that stayed consistent. I still am careful about how I move and what I lift, etc., but my pain has only ever hit a 4 or so since that day I first experienced relief. Now I'm going on 2 months out since that day (6 months since my first shot), and I'm still holding strong. I just thank Dr. Spence so much for giving me relief.|I started out this experience with low expectations for myself and the response my body would have to the weight loss treatments. As a mother of 5 weighloss has been a thing for 15 years! I was BLOWN away by all the benefits i gained! My weight  went down each monthly as i met with Kira and she helped me work through every mile stone. I lost 30 lbs total and did it slow and steady for my body to manage. My blood sugar levels were amazing and my mood stabilized, my inflammation markers went down significantly! I felt an overall improvement of health! I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone! One of the best experiences I've ever had dealing with weight management! Happy day! Wynn|I'm thrilled to share my incredible experience with Joint Repair & Life Enhancement Clinics of Montana! Before treatment, I was struggling with exhaustion, debilitating brain fog, poor sleep, and zero energy. But after receiving bio-identical hormone therapy, I feel like a new person! I haven't felt this good in years! I now have the energy to enjoy the things I love, my sleep has improved significantly, and the brain fog has lifted, making life so much easier. I highly recommend JR&LE Clinics of Montana for this treatment. You won't regret it! Their expertise and care have truly transformed my life. Thank you!|After years of having aching arthritis in my right shoulder, about 4 years ago the pain changed in character, becoming much more piercing and intense. I went to chiropractors for treatments but relief was only temporary.  The pain continued to get worse and immobilized my arm to the point I couldn't lift a glass. The pain became constant, around the clock, and continued to get so strong, I seriously considered ending my life.
However, as I researched viable alternatives, stem cells seemed worth pursuing.  At first, I tried an injection called PRP, but the doctor told me my cartilage was gone, so it wouldn't help for long, and it helped reduce my pain for only two weeks. I needed a real stem cell injection to rebuild my cartilage.
When I found Dr. Spence, with his advanced umbilical cord stem cell therapy, it seemed even better than getting surgery and extracting my own stem cells, so I got a simple shot in my shoulder.
Within the next 24 hours, I started feeling a softening of the pain and within two weeks my arm felt normal, as if I had nothing wrong with it. It's been that way now for several months.
It's actually now better than my left shoulder, and I am considering having Dr Spence inject that one also.|I received stem cell therapy in March 2023 in my neck, right shoulder, lower back and left knee (in which I had a meniscus tear repaired in 2010).  My neck was extremely stiff and I would hear a popping sound when turning my head from side to side. I had discomfort in my lower back and do have some scoliosis there.  The stress level on my spinal nerves was at the highest level. With the stem cell therapy and PRP injections, as well as the chiropractic adjustments, all areas are much improved.  I received good care and the confidence that Dr. Jahner wanted to improve the quality of my life. This did happen. I am pleased that I chose to go through with this treatment.|Just a great place to go when you need help and don't know where to call. Everybody I dealt with was kind and caring.
Explained everything to me, gave me many options, and the care I received was exceptional.|Pros:
1. Stem cell therapy appears to have worked.  Before xrays of my knee showed it to be bone- on- bone with lots of arthritis.  After xray showed a definite separation between the bones and relief from the arthritis.
2. The extreme diet required actually helped in other health areas.  I was able to go off all my diabetes meds and insulin and all my high blood pressure meds.
Cons:
1. The initial consultation felt like a high powered sales pitch.  Like it was more important to get a hold of my credit card
2. It is a large out of pocket expense, .not coveted by insurance. If I had not been retired and had access to my retirement fund,  I could not have afforded it without taking out a loan.|Stem Cells for a tone meniscus. On day 3 I already felt an improvement in pain and mobility. By Month 3 I was a little disappointed that more healing has not been done. But the difference between month 4 and 6 was huge!!! I was back to surfing and running without pain. It's been a significant improvement in knee function. My knee will probably never be the same before my injury, but I would say if I continue to keep it strong it functions at 95%. It's been a real blessing.

Many factors determine the outcome: age, weight, general health, the extent of damage, physical activity, adhering to post-treatment instructions, smoking, drinking, medications, concomitant diseases like diabetes and heart disease, to name several.

The key is having an experienced physician with all tools at his or her disposal to evaluate each patient individually and determine what the best course of action is based upon the many factors involved. It could be rehab. It could be stem cell injections. It could be stem cell augmented, minimally invasive surgery. It could even be a stem cell-augmented knee replacement in some cases.

Of course, there are cases for which stem cell + biologics injections alone are unlikely to help. That's one of the reasons for stories about getting ""stem cell injections"" that didn't work. In some of those cases, the doctor probably shouldn't have done them in the first place because they were unlikely to work. In others, the doctors are using inferior products that they haven't tested in a lab themselves. They have no idea what's actually in them, which is usually no stem cells, very small numbers of stem cells, or even non-viable (dead) cells. We are Montana's original and longest-running stem cell provider and we pride ourselves in always and only using the most ethical and effective stem cells for our patients.

I moved to a new state an after seeing the PM in this state I can only imagine what was said about me in ""report"" because I was suspicious of the wording of many things during the consult.|Horrible place to go for chronic pain. They cut me off of the medication I was doing well on without any taper. I was on 60mg of mme and I had been on the same dose for over a year. I had just had brain surgery a few months prior. When  I returned from surgery they said they could no longer prescribe to me since I had tried an illegal drug when I was a teenager. I had just answered that question honestly on a questionnaire they had just given to me that day. I'm 43 yrs old now. Mind you I had been with this clinic for over a year and answered all kinds of questions pertaining to my past prior to this visit. All was ok until the CDC guidelines came out that year. Then they said no, we are sorry we have to cut you off,  it is our policy to do so if you have ever tried an illegal drug. I have seen the policy and there is absolutely nothing like that on there and there has not been anything added like that since. I was treated like an addict. Not only that but the new doctor I was given mocked my choice of treatment for my condition. She walked in, threw down what she called my 'very thick file for someone so young and that looked so good', and said 'sooo you chose to be sliced and diced in NYC huh? How's that going?'  The neurosurgeon I went to was the best surgeon I could of gone to for my complex issues. I have a chiari malformation which means my brain and my brain stem (with my particular degree of herniation) was being compromised along with EDS a connective tissue disorder that makes surgery for me more difficult. Several chiari patients have died from this kind of compression. The surgeon I chose to travel to did several of these kinds of surgeries a month and the Benefis surgeons I went to in my town did maybe 2-3 a year. They told me the surgery would not help me. This was outdated information based on older diagnostics for chiari. I knew I'd have to find someone to help me. I was being looked at and treated as if I exaggerated my need for treatment. The Benefis Pain Doctor said 'well I guess if you look hard enough someone will eventually do the surgery you want, some just care about the money.' I was floored. After surgery my severe central sleep apnea was gone. Proof the surgery helped correct what could of been life threatening. Proof the Benefis Pain Management Dr that mocked me had no idea what she was talking about.  Proof that my research and patience and praying and hoping and being able to come up with all the money to finally get the help I needed in NYC had paid off! It took a few years but I made it.  Not only did I have to deal with all of this but the doctor before her that I had at this same pain clinic didn't even know what kind of chiari I had!  At our last visit before my surgery he said good luck with your Budd Chiari! I said what? Oh wait.. no.. and then I said never mind and walked off knowing he was leaving the clinic and I wouldn't see him again anyway so why explain now. As it dawned on me that he didn't know my true diagnosis for over a year,  I was pretty mind blown. But at least he was kind to me and treated my pain. It scared me that not only one but two physicians in the same facility could be so ignorant to my conditions. I still have pain because the surgery is not a cure all but it did help to rid me of the anxiety I had knowing I could of died from this malformation without surgery. I have other conditions as well but she didn't even care to ask about those. This last experience with Benefis pain clinic I had was the one that made me lose faith in what was going to be my hope of living a close to pain free life. This happened to me over two years ago and I still have anxiety over doctor visits now and I now have to settle for how my life is going to be from now on. Painful. Since my conditions are also progressive ones, the pain is not going to get better with time but worse. I try to remain positive though.  At least for now I have a small amount of  pain control from a very wonderful and caring  primary care doctor. It could be worse. But it could be a lot better.|Dr Spanbauer is Fantastic listens to you, and cares about your concerns.

He said he'd call in 2 weeks regarding potential pain relief. He did, I  was fine, no further treatment needed. Today I received a text saying I owed $40. I called his office for an explanation and found it was a charge for his follow-up phone call! They'd billed my insurance $145.00 and my share was $40.00. Unbelievable!
If you utilize this business, you might consider refusing any follow-up phone calls and save yourself some money. All he wanted to know was whether he hit the right spot with his injection. So I paid for his satisfaction.|0 stars! Beware of a business that cannot function properly. Waited 7 weeks for initial appointment. Got there 40 minutes before my appointment time. Waited an hour after my scheduled appointment tume before seeing anyone. Then scheduled for injections for a week later. Get to my scheduled appointment and they have no scheduled appointments for me anywhere. I live an hour and a half away. And all the desk girl said was ""oh I'm sorry would like you reschedule"" NO. I WILL NOT DO BUSINESS HERE EVER.  If you can't even get your scheduling right there's no way I'm allowing you to put injections into my spine.|The Doctors and Nurses are great. Unfortunately, every other aspect of this business is a failure. Their billing department is either incompetent or malicious. I'm covered by workman's comp, and they confirm this every time I check in. Yet I always get a bill and then have to jump through hoops with the billing department that claim they have no access to my insurance information. How the hell do they send me a bill if they have no access to my information? I would avoid this place unless you have no other options.

It also speaks volumes that they refuse to reply to negative reviews. This place is a yikes.|The negative reviews are shocking.  Personally, I have LOVED my experience with everyone at Advanced Pain & Spine, Missoula; the staff, the nurses, the surgeons, the assistants; everyone has been WONDERFUL.  I give 5 stars based on my own experience both of lower back nerve ablation, its testing block treatments, and additionally an injection for sciatica.  (Four treatments in total, as of Dec 2024.)  I found everyone on staff to be compassionate, attentive, human (not robotic), professional, personable, and all-together wonderful. The procedures were necessarily painful but have yielded excellent results; I'm deeply grateful -- I feel that I am in good hands and couldn't ask for better.  I can't speak for others, but this was my own experience and recommendation for this clinic.|I am a disabled veteran who has dealt with sometimes debilitating lower back pain. In the past 7 years I've seen Nicole Swartz FNP and Dr. Danaher. They have been incredible and if possible I would give 10 stars. My pain was managed, they always took great care of me and my needs. The hardest part was getting the VA to cooperate with me getting care in the community. Ultimately after a few years of injections to help the pain I received a spinal fusion which was referred by dr danaher only after the injections weren't doing the job anymore.  I've lived with chronic pain for too long and couldn't say enough good about the people, knowledge and work, advanced pain and spine did for me.|This place has managed to completely destroy me and any sense of self worth and joy in life I had. I went from owning a great business here in Missoula to being completely bedridden. I went there for help with very manageable back pain, which worked for a short time with the help of injections. Then, something went horribly wrong with my back. All of a sudden I was in more pain than I had ever experienced in my 49 years. Pain so unbearable I did not sleep for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. My husband watched in horror as I would spin in circles, day after day, trying to find a position I could sleep in to no avail. This pain came on very suddenly and I had just had their injections done. I went back in. I couldn't walk, I was so sleep deprived I couldn't think. They didn't want to order any tests, they wanted to do more injections. I literally begged for them to do something. I still can't believe I wasn't sent for imaging. Over 6 weeks the unbearable pain moved down my leg. I crawled into my garden tub to try to find relief and a comfortable position. The hot water and the bouncy of water created just enough relief I fell asleep...and slipped under the water. By the grace of God, my husband just happened to be in the driveway and headed in when this happened. He pulled me out of the tub, but the result was 10 days in the ICU and a very close call. Luckily, I did find a doctor who, upon hearing the entire story, ordered an MRI. I had an emergent surgical spine, only now I have to wait ANOTHER month because I was given steroids in the ICU and you cannot have a surgery involving bone when you've had steroids...but at least I had answers and found someone who was concerned about more than the money they will make off of an office procedure...AND there's the thing, this place makes so much money off that procedure room in the back that it's what drives that business, patient care be damned. Suffice it to say, the damage that was done due to a lack of care has left me with a severely atrophied left leg and a snowball effect of medical issues with my lungs. I dont leave my room due to pain and mobility issues now. My husband is now my caregiver, im far too young to need a caregiver. No more walks along the river, no more shopping trips with friends, no outings with my son. I am unable to help with my mom as she faces end of life care, I cannot even tolerate the 120-mile car ride to visit. Just to name a small fraction of the things these people stole from me by not giving a crap about anything but the almighty dollar gained by those fairly useless injections.

Don't even get me started on the RFA. it appears burning perfectly good nerves causes significant issues later on, issues where I'd had none before.|I've seen Nicole Swartz for many years now and have received outstanding care from her and other doctors I have seen there. I would recommend this place to other people who need pain management.
Jon D.
Plains|Steer clear of this place. These doctors are flat out negligent. I'm now watching a family member who was recommended for a 4th back surgery debilitate even further. The success rates are less than 5% but of course no one bothered to explain that them. This person who received this unnecessary and dangerous surgery will like lose their ability to walk due to these doctors lack of care and understanding. These doctors also fail to review medical records resulting in confusion and ultimately extreme harm to the patient.

It's a shame that clinics like this even perform these kinds of surgeries when the evidence is clear. Most of the time they do not work. But of course all surgeons really care about is getting paid. So great job! You just ruined someone's life. Thanks a lot and shame on you.",2024-11-01|2024-10-08|2024-09-25|2024-10-20|2024-11-18|2024-10-20|2024-12-04|2024-05-23,4|1|2|5|5|1|5|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",66|65.6|61.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot","What is the MRI  and Imaging facility in the same complex as Advanced Pain and Spine?","Yes i believe they are.

I've been a patient for at least 5 years here.

I even changed insurance mostly because of her!  I didn't want to rock the boat so I never told anyone she did these things.

She is disrupting the entire practice and misinforming the doctor.  The whole office is in an uproar lately, he even fired a long-time employee.  I thought Dr. Jahnke was kind originally but he never listened to or addressed my concerns and stopped trying to fix me.

He's changing professions and board certification anyway, go elsewhere or be sorry unless they fix these issues.  You've been warned.  :(

I'd had surgery on my other shoulder and didn't want to go through the long drawn out recovery. From day one care from all the staff was exceptional. They were all very good at their jobs and me feel calm and relaxed. Big props to Christina! She is incredibly sweet, very easy to talk to and could put up with my crazy sort of humor. I always looked forward to going in to see her!|I Love QC Kinetix . My Left knee was so bad,  bone on bone. Pain and my ortho Dr stated I needed surgery complete knee replacement. I try to look into alternative procedures. I FOUND  QC Kinetix on the radio advertisement. 6 month treatment and now no pain.  Able to go up and down stairs walk miles. It has been a year ago when I started. So grateful to the amazing staff and grateful
That I avoided surgery..No down time all natural what more could you ask for. I'm 75 years old so not just for the young. Great to do the things I used to do and then some. Love the staff ...|I came across QC Kinetix after years of trying every possible option medically besides surgery to fix my lower back pain. After I got out of the Army and after an accident I had in 2011, my lower back had started to get to the point of having so much pain it was immobilizing me every day making it harder and harder to move and function. After being told I had exhausted all my options besides having surgery I wasn't sure what else I could do. After hearing about QC Kinetix on the radio I did some research and decided to give it a try. From the start with the initial consultation through all of the following appointments I immediately felt welcomed and had nothing but positive experiences with everyone that worked there and the way they handled the treatments. They are very friendly and inviting from the moment you walk in the door. They make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need to better assist you. They walk you through every procedure from start to last and communicate clearly everything they are doing.

I have one procedure left for my back treatment and all I can say is that it has been nothing but positive results. I immediately started to feel a noticeable difference in my mobility and pain levels from the very first appointment. From there it only got better. I am able to move without constant pain, get out of bed in the morning without having to use my hands to force my back to straighten upright. I work outside and have noticed that I can get through my day with little to no discomfort. I can actually see going forward the quality of life in my body improving and getting better after every visit.

I would 100% highly recommend QC Kinetix to anyone who is looking for another option and especially anyone who has been told that surgery is your only option.|After 4 years of lower back pain...5 different doctors and multiple opinions on treatment I found relief through the treatments here.

My lower back pain consisted of 2 types of pain. A constant dull ache in the lower back region and a direct intermittent sharp pain more centered in the same region. The direct pain  was off and on throughout the day. The constant dull ache was the most debilitating and wearing.

While the cat scans, ex rays and previous doctors couldn't positively identify the problem, I was given multiple treatment options to try. Everything from chiropractic, physical therapy, acupuncture, dry needling, rest and medication. Nothing relieved the pain. When I asked the last orthopedic doctor I saw about the treatments offered here he did not recommend them.

I'm glad I didn't listen to him. I started my first treatment here 7 months ago and finished my last treatment 2 months ago. Midway through the treatments the dull pain started to improve and now it is virtually all gone. The intermittent direct pain does occasionally happen but it's definitely less frequent and not as severe. It's something I can easily tolerate...almost more like normal aches and pain from regular life's activities. It seems there is even more healing and improvement each week.

I wish I would have done this from the start and avoided the pain, expense and frustration I endured these past 4 years. It's nice to feel so good once again.|I had right ankle pain for years. It was so bad 24/7 that I couldn't sleep and was becoming home bound. After the first couple of injections the pain was gone. I was able to sleep and have resumed working.

He should have a 5 star rating in my opinion. I moved here in June and have been seeing Eric and he's great as well, however today I had an appointment with Dr. Kneeland. I've had chronic pain since I was 27 years old, I am now 51, as you can imagine I've seen my share of pain docs and surgeons. With today's opioid epidemic I certainly can understand the issues that surround that. I have heard it all from you're too young, which was my personal favorite to being labeled as ( you can fill in the blank) I was not taken seriously until the imaging results came in. I've been to every kind of PT, injections, tens units, massage, how to cope therapy (which do have some great tools to put in your tool bag) Etc... the most horrific pain in my life was when C5 kicked C6 and C7 on my spinal cord in which almost paralyzed me. I'm so grateful that I'm not paralyzed, post surgery, however it still didn't fix other problems. Long story short I've been through my share of pain specialists, and what I appreciated most today was not being labeled, Ned made me feel comfortable and important. I also really appreciate that he's trying to create a new plan of action to help me manage my pain effectively and carefully. I walked away feeling blessed to have found him, and am pleased he's my new pain doc. If you're struggling with pain and are searching for a doctor I wouldn't hesitate in making an appointment and see what he could possibly do for you.
I don't write too many reviews but I felt compelled today to write more than just a few words, I know in doing my own searches I wish some would elaborate more. It's hard finding a good connection and someone who listens.
Thank you Dr. Kneeland for the support and ease today, I also appreciate your bedside manner and helping me improve my pain as best as humanly possible. Feeling greatful, and hopeful.|very unorganized and disrepecful staff and facility. They also lie and put BS on your chart for other DR to view. From my first visit to the last I would rather deal with the pain then the incompetant staff at logan health pain and so called Dr they have. I am 100% disabled combat Vet and the VA is better than these people, that is saying something!|I am a veteran age 65 with severe low back lumbar pain at L4 and L5 S1. The VA only allows two epidural spine shots a year, once every 6 months. There are 52 weeks in a year and for 46 weeks I am in pain. I have been in pain since 2009. Only these last few years has the VA allowed for these pain shots. It is no exaggeration when I say that my life experience is mostly experienced in pain. I walk like an old Korean rice farmer. I was stationed in South Korea I know how an old Papasan Korean rice farmer walks. Picture an elderly man with a walking cane bent forward taking one step at a time very slowly. That describes me. There are days when I truly and seriously am concerned that I am taking my last steps as the pain is that intense.

I deeply dread these epidural spine shots. They hurt as they go deep into the spine and release the medication. On two different occasions in two different facilities and with two different doctors I  had to scream  for them to pause the injection as the pain was so intense. One doctor explained that the injection site was tricky and hard to get to. At the other facility the other doctor made four attempts each time very painful and I had to scream at him to stop and he refused to stop until he reached the injection site and then he mocked me and asked did I want him to stop now.

My experience with Dr Kneeland, today, was wildly and dramatically different in that the process was completely painless. He counts down 1-2-3 and then injects lidocaine to numb the injection area before going deeper to the injection site. I felt a pinch of a needle but he does it so fast it hardly has time to register and the area is numbed and the larger needle is used and the only thing I felt was the pressure of the medication entering the injection area. I never felt any pain,"" my hand to God!""

Sometimes at the end of the procedure I feel a quick sharp jolt of electricity down my right leg and this injection was no different it is sudden and there's no time to prepare for it but it was not painful at all.

My hand to God, this was an amazing experience. I will not be anxious when I visit again in 6 months.|Kneeland did a phenomenal job on my nerve block and steroid injection.   The whole thing took less then a few minutes.     The nurses that prep you for the operation are soo kind and empathetic.  I'm not sure who helped me but she was a sweetheart.   Highly recommended them.|I've noticed Dr. Kneeland likes to give ALL his advice, doesn't take time to listen to the patient. I thought this was a pain clinic to help with pain!!! I've had 3 surgeries on the same shoulder and looking at a 4th!! They're not helping, in fact they want to decrease my meds, which are nothing!!! I'm not happy with the treatment I'm receiving from him!!!|Suffering from degenerative disc issues I needed some other way to handle my pain without the affects of narcotics. Eric Belanger and Dr. Kneeland are very helpful in aiding pain management with lifestyle changes.|Dr. Kneeland did an EXCELLENT job with my radiofrequency ablation on my facet and SI joints.  I didn't feel much pain and had no negative repercussions, but I DO have pain relief!

When she discussed options with you, you told her if you found anything in her system other than her pain medication (legalized marijuana) that you would drop everything leaving her with nothing.  She was too afraid to even have my sister come to an appointment with her because of how you treated her.  She suffered from COPD, which meant she needed to be up and moving around on a regular basis. Due to the pain she was in. She sat on her couch and aspirated  which caused pneumonia then sepsis which led to her untimely death.

Not so! You must have a driver!""
I believed the two people I talked to at his office... that I could get the procedure and walk to a nearby motel... as I DID NOT HAVE A DRIVER this one time! Well they lied, and of course no one will own up to it. Well now, of course, I was not allowed to proceed. And now I am no longer welcome at his practice apparently... ""no appointment"" for me! Be warned... no driver... no procedure... no matter what anyone at his office might tell you. P.s. I was not upset with the doctor until now. I know his people set his byte and he has to support his troops. I am just sad that I am not to be believed.

He is an outstanding physician who cares deeply about helping people get better and improve their physical and mental well-being. I highly recommend Dr. Caldwell and his entire practice. They are exceptional human beings!|If there were zero stars I would have chosen that.  My primary referred me to this physician back in 2021 after I got T-boned by a truck, have a broken back causing severe chronic neuropathic pain.  Dr. Caldwell lectured me for 2 hours on two subjects:  That I he would not be giving me any narcotics (I did not ask for any) and then started in about the pain being in my head and on and on and on. He was arrogant and condescending.  I've been a nurse for 50 years and never experienced anything like this.  I left, called Mayo Clinic Division of Pain medicine and I got the most amazing respectful attention to my painful broken back.  I received 3 injections there ending in a RFA (Radio Frequency Ablation) which has created a new pain free life for me.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLINIC!!  They are terrible here!  Mayo Clinic is worth the effort and you will be treated 100% differently.|Dr. Caldwell is one of the few Doctors that I trust. He is straight forward and has a tremendous amount of integrity. He encouraged me to take more action in my daily living with pain. Caldwell turned me on to some great literature and work books in addition to Cortisone injection I received. The information I received through out my visits was invaluable, and more beneficial than the injection. I thank you for your honesty and dedication to the patient.|Dr. Christopher Caldwell > a 5 Star Physician
He and his staff have guided me through long periods of chronic intense pain.  Under his care I'm active and dealing with my pain in a positive fashion.  I walk.  I garden.  I swim.  I go to the gym.  I'm able to normalize my activities.  Pain is pain....but for me its not a disability.|1. Asked ( challenged) me why the doctor wanted me to receive a cortisone shot in my left hip in addition to the cortisone shot in my right hip. Said that my doctor knows about joints, but that ""HE"" is the expert in pain.
2. Rhetorically asked if I wanted a shot in my elbow that doesn't need medication, also, saying that he is ""paid by the shot"".
3. Made 4 jokes about the tattoo on the small of my back to his staff while performing the procedure. After I announced that the tattoo is 22 years old and is my husband's name, he retorted that [the age of the tattoo] ""explains it's sag"".

I have been a patient of Dr. Moore's for the past two years and can personally attest to the level of care he provides to his patients.  I have seen Dr. Moore on various occasions for evaluation and treatment of different ailments and am always pleased with the care I receive and the results I experience.  I first met Dr. Moore after being referred to him by a physician/coworker/friend for ongoing low back and hip pain.  I found it encouraging that I was able to call his office and schedule an appointment to be evaluated and treated that same day.  However, what I appreciated most about this visit was the fact that Dr. Moore did not require an ""initial consultation visit"" or ""x-rays"" before treating me.  Instead, he reviewed my medical history, listened to my symptoms/concerns, performed a thorough physical examination and used his findings to develop a comprehensive plan of care.  Following the first treatment, I experienced immediate pain relief and felt noticeably better...after two treatments my pain was completely resolved and I was back to my normal self.  This has been my experience with Dr. Moore no matter what ailment I present with....the treatment provides me with significant and lasting results.In regards to Dr. Moore, it is evident that he genuinely cares about helping his patients and takes great pride in his ability to improve their quality of life.  He takes the time to listen and fully understand your concerns and goes above and beyond to ensure your needs are met.  I also appreciate that he will find or create availability in his schedule to see you on the same day you call for an appointment if need be. He is conscientious about the cost of his services and works with you and your insurance company to ensure the care you receive is affordable.  Lastly, Dr. Moore recognizes the importance of working in conjunction with other members of the healthcare team and doesn't hesitate to refer you to an appropriate provider if necessary.Since becoming a patient of Dr. Moore's, I have recommended his services to many of my family members, friends, coworkers, and acquaintances- as well as to individuals I have cared for (I am a RN).  I can honestly say every individual that I know who has received care from Dr. Moore...including those who were initially hesitant to schedule an appointment...were impressed with the attention and results they received and were extremely grateful for my recommendation.  I would strongly encourage people to visit Dr. Moore's website and look at the services he offers and the conditions he treats to determine how he too can help you.|Dr. Chris Moore has provided excellent care for both me and my family for years.  The first time was for low back pain during pregnancy.  He has since then helped me through a second pregnancy, a car accident, three marathons and various other occasional aches that happen in life.I highly reccommend Dr. Moore if you are looking for a provider who is thorough, time efficient, and successful at treating your needs.|Dr. Moore did a wonderful job dealing with my back problems.

I try to make a concise list of my concerns in a few bullet points before my app to foster efficiency and effectiveness. Living in pain  is a constant assault on the body and mind so I must put my feelings and presumptions aside to get the most out of the visit and take advantage of the vast amount of services and expertise at this pain clinic. I've read some of these bad reviews and I've seen some of these people in the waiting room acting like dipsticks. You get out what you put in!!  Your misfortune is not a pass to act like a troll and expect results and respect.
Thanks, George|We recently moved here and went to Dr Bone at SCL Health and have never been treated so poorly. He has zero compassion for anything you feel or have to say. He is the definition of the ""Little man complex"". Using his title as a doctor to manipulate and belittle you making you feel terrible.  I'm shocked that a well known healthcare company like SCL Health would have someone like this on staff. DON'T EVER GO TO THIS PSEUDO DOCTOR.  This guy is poster child for the state of healthcare today.  Here's an idea, treat you patients like human beings. Something this guy knows nothing about.
Makes you wonder about SCL Health overall.
If your ever refered to this loser ""LEAVE SKID MARKS""|I recently moved from Oregon to Cody, Wyoming.  I was sooo blessed to find Dr Schabacker M.D. and Hans Bone P.A. right away. I was injured and became a chronic pain patient in 1985, 35 yrs ago.  I have had many pain doctors and Dr Schabacker & Hans both go to the top of my list.
