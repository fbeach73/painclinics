They had another urine in the box that did not have a name on it. I think that it was not my urine they tested. I have never done Cocaine in my life. They seen  me for the last time and acted like everything was ok . Got my medication and then I was told I was Discharged. I don't understand why they will never admit that they made a mistake. I have never had any problem with this Practice but I'm really concerned about the way things were handled. Everyone makes mistakes!!! But I know as a fact I did not have any Cocaine in my system. But I was still discharged . I went to DR Fulton for 22 years and never had any problems. ( May he R.I.P ) . THE DEA handled all the Urinalyses and for all that time I never had anything in my Urine. I just think I should be given another chance. They can give me another Urine or whatever they would like. No one wanted to hear what I had to say. But as a practice in whole I liked going there. I would really like to come back to Dr. Sayheed. I think I should get another chance. This just really sadens my heart.|This is the WORST Dr's office I have ever experienced! Injections are MANDATORY, staff turnovers are constant! My best friend husband is a severe diabetic and he received a MANDATORY Cortisone Injection, and he was NOT WARNED that the Steroids spiked his blood sugar for a week! I have went here years ago. NOTHING HAS CHANGED! Sayeed is all about the MONEY. His exams for follow ups are so painful that I would leave that office in more pain than before I arrived! Sayeed also has multiple MALPRACTICE CASES! Please do your research to save the time, money and headache!

I HIGHLY recommend going to Center for Interventional Pain and Spine, at Elkton! That is the BEST office I have been to!!|I love seeing Dr. S. He is very good when it comes to new patients. He really tries to narrow down where the pain is coming from, and make a plan to relieve the pain. There is a women at the front desk by I believe her name is Nicole. She's very polite always smiles and does her best to help you with what you need. Energy is amazing she works very hard and tried to accommodate you to the best of her ability. A women works there by name of Linda she's very rude and nasty. She talks to people how ever she likes patients and staff. She's yells and gets disrespectful, and she's just has very nasty energy. She doesn't acknowledge the good her staff do only the bad. She's has 0 patients. Other then that I do wish my medication went back to how it was before my pregnancy, but for some reason they won't put it back to tha. Other then that they been doing better with the wait time and Ms.Joan is very nice and also tries to manage your pain correctly.|Finally found a pain practice that is really focused on their patients well-being and how they are progressing to make you pain free... U Matter 2 Radio|BEWARE
Do not go to this office. I repeat. Do not go here period they have the rudest. Most disrespectful staff I have ever encountered. I have been cussed out, hung up on and screamed at as well as many of their other patients. Their staff has a very high turnover rate as well. I have spoken to a few of their staff members and even one doctor it is just as bad to work there. They do not care about your pain. The doctor just wants to give injection, so he can get the money. Dr
Sayeed is rough and cold. LINDA AND MELISSA ARE THE WORST OF THE WORST. How can any good come from such a nightmare of a place. Do yourself a favor.  Avoid this horror show!|Very polite staff and Dr S really explained my MRI and after all these years I finally understand what's going on with my back. I have been to several pain doctors but Dr S made me feel like he really cares. He set up a plan and I really hope I finally get some relief|I love all of the providers at Nova Interventional Pain Management. They have helped be get through my pain for several years now.

His bedside manner is genuine and thorough and the staff at both the practice and surgical centers are the best I've ever encountered. This practice saved my life; gave me back my sanity and my future ability to be mobile and active. Highly recommend!!|Excellent care, excellent bedside manor, caring Dr's. Treated as a person, family member. Knows our name and history without chart. Dr Patel talks frankly and with compassion. Great sense of humor. Gets to the problem and explores options that the patient understands and is comfortable with. Cannot recommend this practice enough. We see Dr A. Patel and so happy to have found him and staff.|I did not have a good experience. I initially came to see if they could take over the epidurals I was getting, but they refused to give me the same dose of medication based on their feelings instead of any evidence. Then, I needed occipital nerve blocks, and I advised the pain was at the base of my skull. Injections were done in the top of my head and not where the pain was in the lower occipital region. It was a wasted procedure and I'm still confused why it was done. I have since seen the medical records from the visit and I'm pretty sure they say he did the lower injections when they were not performed. All I know is I didn't get appropriate treatment, and there seems to be a lack of understanding of the medications being used  as well as a lack of understanding of the anatomy.|As someone with Ankylosing Spondylitis, chronic pain was unfortunately a part of my day-to-day. I'm so glad I found Delaware Valley Pain & Spine. I had no idea pain management existed, and Dr Patel and his team did such an amazing job at making my life more manageable. Highly recommend these guys, they are both friendly and effective!|Dr. Rosen is the best pain management doctor I've had, and I've had several over 30 years for back pain. I've gotten more relief since I've been seeing him than I've had from other places.

He isn't very close, but it's worth the drive to see him. I'm about 45 min to an hour away depending on traffic of course. If you have Pain Management issues be sure to give them a try, you won't regret it.|Super friendly and welcoming staff, felt very taken care of. Dr. Patel is an excellent doctor, listened to me with a lot of respect and empathy, was very informative and made me feel like I will be ok. He was very clear on next steps and possible courses of treatment. Front desk staff was also very helpful when I had to call back to get an MRI script fixed and updated so I could schedule the test. Highly recommend this office!|The best move I ever made was switching pain management doctors.  DVP&SI is wonderful.  Dr. Rosen takes the time to listen to his patients' concerns.  PA-C Armen is also fantastic.  I can't say enough wonderful things about his office staff.  They return phone calls on the same day!  They are on top of all the prior authorization documentation Express Scripts throws at them. I am receiving great care and I can't thank them enough .|Everyone there care about you.

Prior to the procedure, I went to his office on Falls Rd to have the cyst examined. The staff was very sweet and welcoming, during my initial visit and during my follow up visit. In addition, the staff at the surgery center was amazing also. Overall, my experience was great and I would definitely recommend Dr. Schneider to my family and friends.|Dr. Schneider is very patient with his patients for sure. Answers all questions and very friendly. Professionally, he did a great job with the lasers on a large scar on my leg. Highly recommended.|Dr Schneider is probably one of the best doctors I've ever encountered. He is extremely well formed and will do everything that he can to help a patient. He is great with patients with rare conditions and will do due diligence to find the treatment that will best help a patient. In my years as his patient he very seldomly gave me pills for my condition and when he did they were adjacent to other treatments and never narcotics! He's not the type to get you stuck on pills or pain medication. And injections is what pain management does if you don't take pills! Not all patients qualify for procedures such as burning or freezing of the nerves. Other type of palliative treatments are also conducive to the condition and the patients' physical makeup. There's no such thing as a catch all help all in one treatment for pain. People who give great doctors like this bad ratings because they do not understand how pain management works is harmful to everyone!|Troubles me to read reviews in reference to Dr. Schneider...but assume your pain has affected your negative attitude!!. I personally think Dr. Schneider wants NOTHING BUT THE BEST for his patients!!. He is in his position to treat Chronic Pain and his GOAL is to Decrease as much pain as Possible and must say he has went BEYOND My expectations...by truly listening to my issues and Trying his BEST to HELP BY ANY means possible!!. I am also Cancer Survivor..which brings on issues of its own and myself and Dr. Schneider are well aware of its side effects and the realization that he isn't GOD but still does his best to help me. Must also say as a cancer survivor Dr. Schneider has found ..by examination...growths within me that my own ONCOLOGIST hasn't detected. I was then sent for PET Scan to rule out re-occurring cancer and I Truly Thank Him for his KNOWLEDGE..WISDOM...CARING...AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST...JUST TAKING THE TIME!!!.|After several years of severe, painful spinal stenosis Dr. Schneider administered a series of cortisone shots which provided incredible relief. I can now walk upright and participate in everyday activities again. I found Dr. Schneider to be a caring and profoundly knowledgeable physician with the patient's best interest at heart. I highly recommend him to those in need of pain relief.|Extremely inefficient and poorly run office. In the office for an hour, up to 2.5 hours each visit with 99% of that time waiting. The billing office is uneducated in Medicare billing as well. Absolutely double check the co-pays before writing the check!

Dr Schneider started out to be a well informed provider who quickly turned into one of those pain providers who would rather get a patient bstuck on medications then offer due diligence in finding other options to treat pain or find it's cause.

Steer clear of Nurse Heiderman as well, extremely ill informed and unable to work with rare disease or complex patients.

Unfortunately, it was an overall poor experiance at Spine and Pain. I really wanted to feel comfortable there as I live close by however a longer drive is well worth it to avoid the headaches this office causes. I highly recommend looking elsewhere. This office is geared towards increasing their profit and moving patients in.and out as quickly as possible.  Which may not be too bad if it meant us patients were in and out of the office promptly as well.|I have been seeing Dr. Schneider and his group of Nurse Practitioners and PA's since 2014.  They are excellent and never more than 10-15 past your scheduled time.  However, I'm really afraid that it might go downhill now that Dr. Schneider is being pulled away from this location and put in the White Marsh office.  I'm crossing my fingers and hope to remain with the BelAir Office.  I totally disagree with a prior review.  The BelAir Office is Extremely Efficient and Very Well Run.  As I said, I am just afraid that since Dr. Schneider is moving to the White Marsh office that things might go downhill.  They really do TREAT PAIN.  I'd be 6 feet under without them.|My husband is a Parkinsons patient with chronic pain.  We have to go here every 30 days to get his Rx for pain medication.  The office is very poorly run with staff that clearly would prefer to be elsewhere.  My husband never sees a doctor.  He sees a staffer who's only job is to issue his Rx for a controlled drug.  She does not check his vitals or weight.  His visit is literally 5 minutes from the time he is called back to the time he comes back out.  It is a Medicare rip off as far as I am concerned.",2024-10-01|2024-04-30|2023-02-06|2018-01-03|2019-09-07|2017-10-18|2019-09-16|2019-08-26,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJc-yFgOndx4kRrpdR0PDSfVo,13

I would highly recommend this establishment.|Whenever I visit National Spine and Pain, I am treated respectfully and efficiently. Maria always asks the right questions and discusses the best ways to address my needs. I have confidence that my treatment is is the result of compassionate consideration.|Came in for lower spine issues due to trauma. It seemed that the doc didn't really listened and brushed it off as SI joint problems, set me up to get shots and if that wouldn't work we'd further troubleshoot. He didn't even touch my back once or did any exercises to see where the pain exactly comes from. My insurance denied the claim for shots at first because of the lack of a physical exam, he convinced them after all and in my desperation I gave it a try. Who am I to second guess a professional?
Well, the shots did not improve anything. Came back 2 weeks later to follow up. Different doc, she said I need imaging and then there's the option for more shots.
They hand you out professionally made pamphlets about the shots. My question is, why hasn't any doctor done an actual physical exam to get to the bottom of the issue? Why not imaging first before you pester my body with an invasive procedure? I'm not going back there, it seems they are just trying to milk you for money and dont care about your issue.

Update: shortly after my 1 star review I finally got in contact with the original doctor. He admitted we should have proceeded to get imaging done first. To not battle my insurance, I've finished the PT sessions that were required.
Now I'm ready to book my MRI and misplaced my referral. Of course I cannot get in contact with anyone once again. This is the most frustrating place I've ever had to deal with. I've been calling for days. Don't expect any favors unless you go there to give them money.
The email sent in their reply does not work anymore either.

Update 2:
Shelly is amazing. She works in scheduling and helped me out with my MRI referral, she sent it out immediately. Nonetheless due to the wording the Dr. left in my notes, my insurance would still not approve my MRI.
I'm at a loss.
My problems got triggered by 2 recent incidents, he emphasized the fact that I was having issues since pregnancy, which is true but totally unrelated, probably, so he can get paid for giving me shots, but not caring about my still persistent issue at all.

Terrible place! Other than Shelly. Do yourself a favor and stay away!|After 7 years of being a loyal patient with Maria Wilson at the National Spine and Pain Center in Bel Air MD, I had to re-locate to SC for work.

I've come here for years for spine health and am always so appreciative of their kindness, flexibility with appointments, and the relief I experience physically.  Most recently, I developed a knee problem. Struggled with it for months and finally asked Dr. Tim to take a look. Not just a spine Dr here. I'm over the moon that I'm finally feeling relief. Highly recommended!!!!!|You know, it's funny how life works sometimes. A decade ago, I was just casually scrolling through Groupon looking for deals on massages when I stumbled upon Integrative Physical Health. I thought, ""Why not?"" and booked an appointment. Little did I know, it was a decision that would literally change my life.

After a free massage and X-ray, he sat me down and gave me some news. Turns out, past head injuries I had suffered severely affected my spine. It was to the point where another fall could have been disastrous. Sounds grim, right?

But here's the thing: Dr. Tim didn't just send me on my way. Instead, he suggested a treatment plan that, I kid you not, has been nothing short of transformative. I never felt pressured to begin care which is why I have no problem paying even now that he is considered out of network for us.

The office staff at Integrative Physical Health? Amazing. They're friendly, professional, and incredibly accommodating. They make you feel like you've been part of their family for years.

Honestly, I even briefly switched to a different practice that was closer so I could walk from my job. While they were nice enough, it just wasn't the same experience.

And when we moved to Florida, I started care there, but bragged about Dr. Tim's to everyone who asked about my chiropractic experience.

After 10 long years since my first visit, I'm back with Dr. Tim and his team, and let me tell you, I couldn't be happier. If you're ever in need, I highly recommend Integrative Physical Health. It's not just about the treatment, it's about the entire experience.|I was experiencing sharp knee pain that made my life miserable. By chance, I received one of Dr. Tim's flyers in the mail, which specifically mentioned knee pain (I never usually read those flyers).

Despite my skepticism, I made an appointment with Dr. Tim. He discovered that the issue was actually in my lumbar/hips, not my knee. After a few adjustments, I was pain-free! If you are experiencing joint pain, I highly recommend consulting with this practice.|I had been getting severe back and neck pain that would cause debilitating headaches on a daily basis. It was getting difficult to work, play with my children, or pick up my baby. I had never done chiropractic care before so I was unsure of what to expect. I found this group through my insurance and am so thankful that I did. I called and they were able to squeeze me in same day for an evaluation and start my adjustments the following week. I have been going for almost a month now and am feeling so much better. Barely any back pain anymore and my headaches are completely GONE. The staff as a whole are amazing - incredibly kind and helpful. If you are looking for a chiropractic care, please do not skip on Integrative Physical Health - they are 10000% worth it!|I have been dealing with debilitating back pain from back to back car accidents for two and a half years. I went through 3 different back doctors. All 3 told me they were not able to do much more for me. I was depressed and had resolved myself to being in pain the rest of my life. Dr. Tim was the only doctor to catch two issues with my spine the other 3 missed. In just 2 visits my life changed for the better. I went from near constant pain, minimizing my walking and movement, to having my range of motion back and my ability to stand and walk without pain. I'm already recommending them to all of my friends. I'm happier, more healthy, and starting to move and feel like myself again. Absolutely life changing.|Dr. Tim and his team are the best! I'm down to twice a month for adjustments and laser, and I feel so much better. Lots more movement and flexibility and relief from tail bone pain, as well as, reduction in pain from plantar fasciitis. I've also experienced a reduction in headache frequency. Highly recommend! You'll feel soooo much better!|Went to see Dr.Tim for right hip pain that made walking unbearable. After just 5 sessions I am happy to report that I am pain free and back to doing activities I enjoy! Everyone in the office is super nice and I felt welcomed the second I walked in the door as a new patient.|I cannot suggest this company enough. I originally came in for back pain. Now, Dr. Tim is adjusting not only my back but my ankle!! Dr. Tim has relieved so much pain over the past month I can't thank him enough. And I cannot forget to mention, he has an amazing staff that help and make you feel so welcomed.

I am 100% appalled with the behavior of the advanced pain management staff. My elderly and disabled husband Larry Crawford had been a patient of the Augusta Georgia office for 4 years now and we have started to face neglectful and improper care from his pain management doctor. He has visited with Dr. Malia and Angel who have all been so caring and attentive to his needs in term of pain. However I have had my run ins with other staff members. A receptionist by the name of Ms. Angela is constantly speaking to me in a degrading tone and acting as if she has some kind of superiority to me. I am in no way a rude or confrontational person but she has constantly presented a bad attitude to me and though I have spoken to people about her, the attitude persists. I have been made aware of the many staffing changes that have taken place including Dr. Malia and Angel leaving as well as new doctors being brought in and so I have been a hard time in terms of my husband's medication management. He has had his treatment plan switched without first being informed MULTIPLE times and this has caused his pain to skyrocket because he's being supplied with so many different amounts of medication by his doctor because they do not call us they just make their own decisions based off of FDA regulations instead of tuning the care directly to their patients. I am not by any means saying that laws are not laws but there is not and never has been a reason for my husband to be under suspicion of ANYTHING. He has always maintained anything that his Dr asked. Passed drug tests, was always presenting and talking about his pain, and never ran out any earlier than he should. This doctors office has become nothing more than people in white coats there to keep the numbers right. I am sorry if there is anyone who disagrees but I have had it to my wits end with the Augusta Advanced Pain Management Staff!!!! My husband is a PERSON, not just a number and I will not continue to let him be in pain and even risk dependency development because they feel it is ok to continuously lower his prescription dosage without his nor my knowledge. This is not Ok and I will not stand for it any longer!!  I will  be reaching out to proper advocates who support elderly people dealing with chronic health issues. WE HAVE RIGHTS TOO!!

People also ask
Do doctors have an obligation to treat pain?
Al Overview
+3
Yes, doctors have a recognized ethical and legal obligation to treat pain, meaning they should actively assess and manage a patient's pain as part of their standard of care; failing to do so can be considered medical negligence.
Key points about this obligation:
Ethical principle:
The medical field widely considers pain relief as a fundamental ethical duty, with many professional codes explicitly stating physicians should strive to alleviate suffering and pain.
Patient rights:
Patients have a right to appropriate pain management, and undertreating pain can be considered a violation of their rights.
Legal implications:
In many jurisdictions, not adequately addressing a patient's pain can lead to malpractice lawsuits.
However, important considerations exist:
Individualized approach:
While pain management is a priority, the appropriate treatment will vary based on the patient's specific condition, medical history, and potential risks.
Open communication:
Doctors should engage in open dialogue with patients to understand their pain experience and collaboratively decide on the best treatment plan.|I have been a patient of Advanced Pain Management for numerous years following injuries sustained on my job as a State Trooper for 30 years.  These injuries left me permanently disabled.  Here I was so fortunate to meet Dr Van Malia!  Dr Malia is one of the most knowledgeable, kind hearted Pain Specialists that I have EVER met.  From the start he listened to me, read my LENGTHY case charts from the various surgeons and pain specialists that have worked on me over the years, all without making any significant progress in reducing pain symptoms.  Dr Malia worked tirelessly working out courses of treatment designed to give me better quality of life, never once telling me there was nothing more to be done as I heard SO many times before!  Now Dr Malia worked with my insurance company to get me approved for a spinal cord stimulator designed to improve life quality.  Initial testing was impressive in pain reduction levels.  The only problems are the two Medtronic representatives that have constantly failed to work with me to fine tune the settings to achieve maximum benefits.  Dr Malia continues to get them to do their jobs and follow protocols even though his duties ended with the test phases. How many Doctors do you know that continuously keeps going above and beyond his responsibilities because he truly 100 % CARES about his patients welfare!   Thank you Dr Malia for your caring, your friendship and always being there for me!|I was extremely pleased with the Doctor Hemant Yagnick evaluation of me and my MRI of my lower back which is extremely painful. He stated that based on the MRI he saw of my lower back spine that he recommended that I have surgery to help do away with the extreme pain and issues that affect my lower back and leg. I told him that the VA has refused to perform surgery on my lower spine back. So he said he was going to send a evaluation letter to the VA recommending surgeon and also having the same evaluation letter given to me that I can use at Fort Eisenhower Hospital to maybe have them perform the surgery.|I have been a patient at Advanced Pain Mgmt for 13 years and they are the best! Dr. Yagnick and Karen are compassionate, kind, and so smart. They always go above and beyond to help their patients. So very thankful for this practice.|Dr. Yanick has been my doctor for over 20yaers he has given me injections and has never caused me any pain he is the only doctor that i would ever let give me injections in my back if anyone ever needs injections he is the best doctor for that. He is a great doctor that cares about his patients.|This professional group of specialists are second to none. The office staff are friendly and helpful. Don't think twice about seeking

The staff welcomes you with a warm smile and very kind. I do see Dr. Agrawal from time to time and each time, its with a big smile and a warm welcoming. Everything is usually explained to me in details which I liked if I have any questions. Lately I've been getting in and out pretty quickly from the office. I appreciate everyone and everything that they all do for me.|They were quite busy today but they worked through the patients smoothly and efficiently. I received excellent feedback and learned new information regarding my daily questionnaire. Everyone was warm and friendly.|I missed my appointment this morning and I called the staff and they got me back in today. I really like this staff. They are very friendly and nice.|The staff is great they have people skills they greet you with a smile all day long you're in and out in a good time frame even when they're behind and the lobby is full the doctor is friendly and he explains everything he's going to do before he does it it's their policies I don't agree with $50 if you're late a minute after the allowed 15 minute grace period,$50 if you call days before your appointment telling them why you can't come that day at that time bc something unexpected came up,$50 if you miss your appointment, this is my true story with family first pain clinic I was referred to family first I was a new client to them and I had to do a urine screen for the first time with them they gave me the address I googled it and I thought I could find the address but I didn't find the address to where the facility was so called family first and explained to them what my situation was long story short bc I couldn't find the facility where they do the urine screens I missed my appointment and they charged me $50 when I went to my next appointment I explained to them that it wasn't my fault and they shouldn't charge me $50bc it's an honest mistake it could've happened to anyone they still charged me $50 so I had to pay $100 or I couldn't see the doctor I was so pissed off bc I couldn't believe they could do me and I know I'm not the only person this has happened to like this their policies suck like a duck in a truck|I was recommended to this place. I spoke with some guy that didn't have good English. He told me what I needed and I said ok I needed a few weeks to get all that information but never scheduled an appointment. So called Drs they said everything was faxed over. Called and talked to same guy he said , yes, all my information was faxed over. Said yes to every question. He assured me everything they needed was faxed over so made the same. For those of you who live in Georgia it was a FREAKING HOT day in July. But I had the appointment so I arrived 15 mins early. Found the right door after walking around and knocking on every other door. The front steps are not easy to walk up. It was 112 out that day and I use oxygen. It was awful. So I get in there told the sweet lady behind the counter everything the guy told me that everything was faxed over and I'm here to pee in my cup. She said we don't have any of your paperwork. I was already so hot from having to be out that day. I started crying. I said the guy I talked to said everything was here but she said nope. She said without your paperwork and referral you can't keep this appointment and since you can't we have to charge you $50 for missing it. I lost it. Crying and telling her how hard it was for me to even come out today. Having a hard time with the heat. Nothing. She went from a sweet lady to not one. She said until your paperwork is here we have to reschedule your appointment and now you owe us $50. Well I said I will not be paying the $50.

Long story short. The end up saying next appointment my paperwork wasn't there and now she said you owe us $100. I said NO. I said I know my stuff was faxed over and they said no.

End in the end. They did have my paperwork. They had me mixed up with someone else. Even after they said they messed up. They still refused to take the $100 off. I said y'all made the mistake and had my paperwork all this time and still want me to pay $100 because y'all got me mixed up with someone else and she said sorry. I refused to pay. I shouldn't have had to if they did their job right.

So warning DO NOT try this place. Before that they tried to charge me another $50 because I couldn't pee enough . That would have been $150 plus they were also filing my insurance.

This place has no intention of helping you if you need a pain dr. Just a bunch of ""towel head type"" of people that just want your money and file false claims on your insurance.

Please report this place if you haven't.|Great experience. Dr. Agrawal and his team went over and above to assist me today. They are always friendly and helpful. A+|They turned me away and I have a debilitating genetic disorder and they made me come three times to
Charge me for drug tests & a nerve study test which put me down for 5 days and was in excruciating pain from it and triggered 2 knee dislocations then waited 6 months and called pretending they would see me then called back the very next day and said sorry so very unprofessional & I would not go here and I'm warning others as much as possible especially on my genetic groups Athens Facebook page for Ehlers Danlos|They have an very nice receptionist..

He is consistently on time, which is very refreshing and has many suggestions as far as herbs, diet and alternative therapies to try to improve my overall quality of life. As far as doctors go, he is always professional, gives me all the time I need for each visit and isn't  judgmental in any way. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a very different pain management experience.|I have been seeing Dr. Parimi for several years now. He is by far the best doctor i have ever been involved with. He was very thorough in his initial assessment of my situation  and suggested several different treatment options. You can tell on your first visit that he really cares and knows what he is talking about. Very down to earth doctor. His scheduling is awesome. There is no wait time for your appointment, at which he is very attentive in making sure your treatment option is working well for you. Dr. Parimi is very professional, but also someone you would call a friend!|I had my first appointment with Dr. Parimi yesterday.  Prior to even seeing him, he spent a considerable amount of time on the phone with me discussing my situation.  This, in and of itself, is very unusual and greatly appreciated!  I was switching pain management doctors, and I was so happy to be able to consult with him prior to officially making the change.  I was so pleased with my first appointment.  I can be a hard critic of pain management centers, where my personal issues are barely addressed. Combine that attitude with an innate crankiness when I'm not feeling at all well and the result can be much less than pleasant at times. This visit was a world away from previous experiences elsewhere. It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. When I say Dr. Parimi made me feel that I was in very safe hands, and even made me feel comfortable enough to share my experiences in truth, then you can believe he is the best. I am truly grateful and I don't get that awful feeling of dread anymore over being in pain management.  I also appreciate Dr. Parimi's partnership agreement with his clients, as I am a by the book type of person.   I don't think words can describe how happy I am.  And, it does not hurt that he is a fellow corgi owner!|As a middle-aged busy executive with chronic pain, Dr Parimi has helped me regain control of my daily routine and hectic schedule. My treatment includes proactive approaches to compliment my medications. His practice is focused and effective. Our appointments have always run on time and the office environment is soothing in itself. For over two years I have been comforted by the dedication to a working patient/physician pain management plan. Many thanks!!|I have seen many doctors over the years, for a variety of health conditions. Dr. Parimi is the first to take the time to sit and talk with me, answer questions, and actively investigate something he wasn't sure about so that we could be on the same page. He is considerate and honest, and I've always had the sincere feeling that he had my best interests at heart. If I need to contact him, he is available, and if I have a question about something not on my medication or exercise regime, he is happy to look into it on the spot for me. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Parimi to anyone seeking assistance with pain management.|Dr Parimi is great to work with.  He is professional, personable, and always wants to make sure that I am being provided the best care possible.  I would recommend anyone that has serious pain issues to use Dr Parimi.  He has made my life much better, after numerous surgeries from playing college football I was at the point where I couldn't go outside and play with my children because I hurt too much.  Now they have trouble keeping up with me!  I've used him for the last 2 years and will continue to see him for the foreseeable future.|Dr Parimi is hands on with his patients. Very polite, professional and extremely knowledgeable about different pain mangement options to put you on the road to recovery. Takes the necessary time to get to know you and is dedicated to assisting your pain issues heads on. Never makes you feel like your just another patient. Which is so hard to find with so many Doctors these days.Great bedside manner! Nice & quiet laid back office environment also.|Dr Parimi is very kind and listens to what I say,  feeling and what I'm going through. He takes the time to make sure that my treatment is right for me. He takes great pride in what he does, is flexible and very easy to work with! I have been to Another pain management place years ago that was a TOTAL nightmare!!!  Dr Parimi sees you AT YOUR APPT TIME!!! He spends time I need, gets medical records to me and insurance company when requested and in a timely manner(immediately!). I have been dealing with many doctors and institutions, and could only wish to have received this level of professionalism with them!

I absolutely love the care that I get from him and the NP Monica McGowan. If you're looking for a Dr that  knows what he is doing and how to hire the best staff to look after you. Look no farther.|Most professional and clean doctor's office! Pain management can be a hard road and I'm so glad to have found Dr. Marshall. He understands women's pain issues related to endometriosis and other conditions better than most OBGYNs I've been to. Highly recommend.|My care was excellent! Dr. Xion explained procedures to me and had visual diagrams  of what she was gong to perform.  Her staff was very friendly and professional.  I would recommend my family
Members  and friends to
Definitely seek this medical office with pain problems

O|I've known this physician and his nurse Monica McGowan for quite some time. I met them at another practice and because of some issues, I lost track of both Dr. Marshall and Nurse McGowan, NP. One day, while scanning Google, I first saw Dr. Marshall. Some MD's develop a deep trust with their patients and I truly believe that they must keep it! In Pain Management, it's very imperative that a patient MUST SHOW that MD that they're doing what's prescribed! I myself am taking strong medicine! At this juncture, he knows I balk at the more invasive procedures that's offered. Every MD needs a good Nurse. I understood that when I was a scrub tech. I met many great Nurses. Monica McGowan mainly works with Dr. Marshall and she's a great Nurse. They're hard to find! She seemed not to talk much to me in the beginning so, I didn't get to know her like I did Dr. Marshall, and even now, the only time there's any interaction with her is at appointment time. This past July, I was hospitalized and even now, I'm recovering. She saw me a few weeks ago. I wanted to discuss this matter with them both, but Dr. Marshall was at his Paces Ferry location. So far, the trigger point's holding. My epidural's scheduled for the day before Thanksgiving. After the interaction with Ms. McGowan, NP and how Dr. Marshall and his medical staff handles change in the office, it seems to me, I'm guaranteed relief and if you decide on Dr Marshall, and Ms. McGowan, NP. you too will experience satisfaction and great relief. (I bet Nurse Monica's smiling at how I kept using NP.) She's a good one and would make a great P.A. Still, she has great knowledge of how Dr. Marshall wants things to go in his practice. I use one word: Positivity. Without that, look for again one word: Chaos. It's no chaos at Regenerative Spine and Pain. They are all good at what they do. Dr. Marshall's double board certified, and graduated from Harvard out of Boston, Emory, and Morehouse, the latter two: Atlanta. Dr. Jennifer Xiong a Harvard graduate is with Dr. Marshall, and Dr. Christopher Williams. They ALL, including Monica, Nurse Practitioner, at his practice, are highly trained at pain relief! This ""snake oil"" they sell on the Net won't hack it and it's a waste of time, but this Regenerative Spine and Pain is part and parcel of how I was wearing nice shoes! Dr. Marshall and his team's making it again, possible. I recommend this medical practice.|Everyone was polite and energetic with positive attitudes. While the appointment seemed fast. The nurses and doctors listened to everything I needed to say and they gave me positive feedback and hope. Even check out had me leaving with a smile.|I've received the best care ever. I have no complaints. The staff is amazing, office is always spotless and no communication issues. I would definitely refer family and friends.|The office asked me to take a drug test, which I agreed to, as I knew they wanted to make sure any medication that was perhaps prescribed didn't interfere with anything in my system.  I waited 30 - 45 mins. to be seen by the Dr. with no update or apology for the long wait. A few weeks later I see they billed my insurance for $600.00 for ONE DRUG TEST!  First of all no one informed me that it would be an additional charge outside of my copay or just possibly an additional charged in general.  They billed TWO separate billing codes to my insurance for ONE DRUG TEST!  I did however still go back to get an injection because I was in pain and the preauthorization process for the injection through my insurance had already begun.  The injection was a  2 HOUR wait! and I was informed of 2 different amounts both of which was not accurate, as now I'm expected to pay 3x the amount AFTER the procedure. Had I been informed of this prior to the procedure I would have held off or not had the procedure done at all!  This office does not have the best communication or transparency.

***UPDATE***

There were 2 claims submitted to my insurance with the SAME billing code for 1 procedure.  I was told one charge was for the Dr. and one was for the hospital/procedure location, but both charges are in the same amount and now I'm being asked to cover 3x the amount I was told I was required to pay at the time of procedure!!|My first visit at Regenerative Spine and Pain Specialists was very reassuring.

Nurse Jennifer took the time to thoroughly understand my pain and the history of my injury. Her communication skills are exceptional; she was able to explain everything involving underlying issues that had been overlooked by others.

His nurse, Jennifer, made sure to secure me a quick appointment when I first needed to be seen. She has been by my side every moment since then (10 months ago). Jennifer even drove out to my house to drop off a radiology disc so I would have it for my neurologist the following day. I don't know how, but she makes sure she is available 24/7 for her patients (even while on vacation at Disney). I don't know what I would do without the talented Dr. Nok and the incredibly empathetic nurse Jennifer. I am pain free, living my best life,  and not taking any pain medications!!!!

Thank you Christopher Watson|This long-awaited review is to express my immense gratitude for the exceptional care I received at Pain Consultants of Atlanta. On 9/18/2024 I recently had a lumbar puncture patch performed there, and initially, I was quite nervous. However, my anxieties were quickly put to rest thanks to the outstanding interactions I had with everyone at the clinic, from the front desk to the nurses and doctors.

Dr. Callaway was absolutely phenomenal. He was incredibly meticulous, which I greatly appreciated. His caring approach ensured that everything was done accurately and in great detail, which put my mind at ease.

I also want to give a special shout-out to the PCA Surgical Team: Lionellie D., Chandra A., Cherelle B., and Jay B. Your professionalism and dedication to patient care were evident throughout my entire experience.

This clinic will undoubtedly be my first choice for any future pain issues. Keep up the excellent work, and thank you for everything!|My doctor sent a referral to a specific MD and every day for 6 days I tried to reach them to schedule an appt but after requesting appt online, leaving 3 phone messages and surgeon referral being ignored, I gave up. No matter which phone prompt I entered I was sent to a voice mail. No contact from them at all so on day 7 from referral I told my surgeon to refer me to another practice. Don't know anything about the physicians but the practice management is beyond unprofessional. I have never had this experience with any other doctor's office.
Update: 4 weeks later they called to schedule an appt!! By then I had already seen another specialist.|Dr. Callaway is very thorough, takes his time and is  very comprehensive.

Doctor explained my treatment in words I understood.I'm so excited about my treatment plan!!|The staff was friendly and kind and Dr.Polk was very nice.|I felt like I was being used for insurance fraud. He continued the care of another physician because I moved but he barely examined me. I got an additional injury while in his care and instead of him doing something for it he just told me the pain will go away on its own. I told him I couldn't be prescribed ibuprofen because of my kidneys and he sent it to my pharmacy 3x's all different occasions and says it was done in error (even after I told him about the first incident). I left and am now seeing a real pain management doctor smh. Watch some of these GA doctors they are money hungry and need to care more about their patients than what insurance they carry.|This use to be the best drs office you could walk into, I started two years ago with Dr Ellison, she was fantastic the office staff was fantastic.. then one day I walked in and was told she wasn't there anymore I would be seeing Dr Polk. He was ok but wasn't Dr Ellison. The last year they have had numerous staff come and go, only one that's still there since I started. She's wonderful and she truly took care of me. The icing on the cake for me was when I went in for my procedure they let a girl that was 'interviewing' to be hired stick me with a needle to put my IV, you could tell she was not comfortable doing it, she stuck me 5 different times before their anesthesiologist (that watched this girl continue to stick me and tell her to keep sticking me in the same arm)  stepped in and did it. Then when I called to cancel the second round of the procedure due to my husband having surgery, the girl that answered the phone was new of course was ugly, made me feel like a junkie for asking to schedule my normal monthly appointment and said 'I mean are you out of medicine or something?' No it's called common courtesy to give notice I won't make that appointment and need to schedule another weeks in advance. Fast forward I come into my appointment on a Wednesday Dr Polk isn't there, Dr Nelson is, no pharmacy would fill my prescriptions because his signature being on Dr polks prescription paper. I went back and forth for days with this office being told different stuff and went without my medications I have been taking 2+ years for 7 days and it didn't phase them at all. I am truly disappointed at how I was done, and hope the office staff learns how to treat people.|Dr. Polk and his staff are very professional, kind and caring.

I was miserable in my day to day life trying to work around it, so it made me very moody, always stressed out, along with a very deep feeling of discouragement succumbing to what I thought would continue to be my everyday life.

They kicked me out of the clinic saying that my urine  test after 1 month and just a couple of days before my next appointment, was dirty. They know that same day if the test is dirty and they wouldn't  have given me any narcotics.  I don't know why  all of a sudden they came to this conclusion.  Maybe because I  rescheduled  my appointment  the day of my appointment. My blood pressure  was dangerously low and I had to be transported to the hospital by ambulance.   I assured them that the only drugs I  take are the ones prescribed to me. Since they  insisted that my test was dirty, they could have taken a hair sample at no cost to them instead  they chose to kick me out the clinic.

However, I was giving a lot of forms to fill out before my procedure. Nobody discussed any of them with me prior During or after many of them discussed complications, etc., nobody explained side effects, etc. afterwards this was a little concerning to me. I have had many operations mini procedures in my life and whenever you're messing with the spinal cord, I feel like there should be at least a review of the Procedure with the doctor or nurse practitioner. I asked about signing the forms and the front desk said they would go over all of them with me when we got into the exam room. This did not happen. I went under an anesthesia and woke in a wheelchair was pushed out to my car quickly with No aftercare instructions.
I am seeing my regular doctor today as I have developed a rash at the injection site. No one has called from the clinic to check on my progress like I would normally expect after any outpatient procedure or anesthesia. I really like the physician that I had initially but that's not who performed the procedure. I was surprised by another Doctor Who said he would be doing it. All this being said the clinic is clean the people are friendly, helpful, and waiting was left to a minimum.|Been going here quite awhile now. About a year ago I wanted off opiods and did so. They kept calling me for months to come back. I decided to give it one more go and they right away not only wanted me back on opiods but increased it to the max dose. I've followed all their rules and guidelines and then get told that my recent urine test had ""small traces of cocaine"" in it which would be impossible since I do not do that kind of thing, I'm drug tested for work and drug tested for another medication. On top of it I have a heart condition and on a stimulant for ADD and with said heart condition I have regular tests, EKGs and blood work done to make sure I can stay with the ADD medication. Basically if I did cocaine I would have a heart attack so it's not possible. Although with this information as well as clean history and record and only back on opiods because they begged and harassed me for months and now I am dependent on them, they kicked me out and also didn't give me any medication to ween off or find another doctor. I am in process of taking legal action for malpractice, especially getting me hooked on an opioid I didn't want to be on in first place with them insisting it was perfectly fine.|At the age of 68 years, having just moved to Georgia, not knowing any doctors, and having suffered chronic back pain for over 40 years, I never dreamed I would find a doctor who could give me relief from the pain. Too many have tried and failed. After my first injection... nothing. But after the second two, I am PAIN-FRE I didn't believe that it would relieve my sciatic nerve pain either, which would not allow me to stand for more than 10-15 minutes, could not find a comfortable position, and even pain pills didn't help. But EUREKA, the nerve pain is gone,..COMPLETELY!!! THANK YOU SUMMIT SPINE AND JOINT!!! I am a patient for life!!|If you're looking for a personable practice who looks out for what treatment best suits you then Summit Spine and Joint Centers is the place you should go. I had a discrepancy with some paperwork and was handling it by phone for two days. I spoke to several nice and helpful associates. One in particular Tory remembered my exact reason I was calling back and altogether they were able to fulfill my issue without having to make the drive to the office. The whole staff is respectful, courteous, and willing to help. Thank y'all very much.|I've been coming here for a couple years now. The front desk staff attitudes have improved immensely!!!!! The young ladies that WERE there carried themselves in a way that caused patients to feel as if they were a bother. Cold, blank stares, monotone voices. I'm glad that there has been a change. Great job. Scott is A-1. He listens and is very personable. He is certainly THE BEST provider here.
The young lady, ladies in transport as of November 5-6, 2024, need SERIOUS training in workplace etiquette. Their conversations in the presence of patients is TOTALLY unacceptable. The cussing and obnoxious, rambunctious attitudes are tiring to say the least. While awaiting my procedure I was subjected to 25-30 minutes of NONE STOP, gossiping, cussing, and LOUD trivial conversations. While the ""grown-ups"" on staff noticeably separated themselves from the young ladies in obvious irritation. The young ladies were COMPLETELY oblivious to the fact that they were AT WORK and in a PROFESSIONAL environment. Certainly I'm not saying that anyone should lose their job. HOWEVER, they need to be made aware that their conduct is unacceptable in this type of environment and that there is a process of maturation that needs to take place|I must say that the couple of times I've been at Summit,  I was treated with respect and dignity. Dr Patel, ( he's adorable by the way) listen to my concerns and didn't rush me off like some kind of medical number. Doc, you rock!  Please don't ever lose the bedside you provide your patients,  or rather me.
Keep doing what you do!!|Summit Spine and Joint has been a Godsend for me in helping with the chronic pain I suffer with. I've been receiving care here for over two years and the doctors and staff have been very professional and caring. They haven't stopped on continuously trying different procedures, covered by my insurance, that offer me the most benefits.|The Lawrenceville office is my favorite by far. The atmosphere is much nicer, cleaner and roomie. Wait times are minimal and the staff so friendly and always treating me professionally and courteous.
As for the Decatur office, Alot of the staff are nice but the few bad apples there, especially at the front desk, Made me never want to go there again and drive the extra 15 miles to Lawrenceville.

On day 1 I had incidents with the data entry Ricky, the way he treat patients is horrible. He argues with them back and forth, I believe he tries to set the tone for how things are run there. Until I met the doctor Dr. Moore, then I understood why. This man is a brute. I missed an appt Oct 1, because my phone broke( they send you reminders).Well they reschedule me for the following week Oct 8th. Well my car broke down, a tree fell in my house and I lost electricity during the hurricane Helene. I got a ride from a friend and I thought my appt was for 9:30am instead it was for 9:00am so I was actually 17 minutes late. While in the way there I called to let them know I was indeed on my way, the lady told me that I was now late and would not be seen and that I wouldn't be seen at all for the month and that ALL APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN CANCELED AS WELL. In all my years of living and dealing with doctors, I have missed, rescheduled and been late and I have never seen where a doctor refuse to see you or to reschedule an appt.  Their bedside manners in dealing with patients who are in need is horrible. I since found another pain doctor altogether. This doctor talks to you any kind of way, so the staff talks to you any kind of way. This doctor is a terrible choice. Beware Aware of Dr. Moore at North Georgia Pain Clinic at 285 Boulevard NE Unit 640 Atlanta Ga. 30312|I like the fact that I usually don't have to wait for a long time. The Medical Assistants are nice and the doctor is friendly most of the time.  However,  sometimes doctors need to try and put themselves in the patients shoes.  Myself personally I have more going on than just back pain, sometimes the pain I have is more debilitating and I take what's prescribed to me for the most part as planned.  Sometimes I have gone of course but not on purpose.  I'm satisfied with Dr. M.

He is really a nice person if you learn him. Thank you staff at the Atlanta office.|Dr Morrison has restored my ability to work, and live my life to the fullest possible. I had seen several other pain doctors, and had had many epidurals, as we as radio frequency nerve ablation. Nothing was helping my uncontrolled chronic pain.
Dr. Morrison's ability to preform regular epidurals has been nothing short of a miracle in my life. I am extremely grateful for him, and the North Georgia staff.|My daughter moved to Georgia and was looking for a new pain management doctor. North Georgia pain clinic was recommended. She tried for 5 months to see one of these doctors. After she jumped through all their hoops and got all the info they asked for she was told by the clinic they would not take her as a patient. When she asked why they said we don't take your insurance. She found out they do take her insurance so she called back and told them. They called her back and said we do not owe you an explanation why we will not see you. So they lied and said they didn't take her insurance instead of giving her the truth. I've worked in the medical field for over 15 years and never have we told a patient we do not owe you an explanation. Very poor  practice and horrible doctors that would tell a young lady who suffers from 4 chronic illnesses. Shame on them.

Refreshing considering that most medical experiences are not like that. Had a little bit of trouble checking out because it was incredibly busy and there was only one person at the front desk, and had to call this morning to make my follow up. But prescription was called in quickly, and I'm glad I went and happy to have this Clinic at my disposal. Still waiting on PT orders.|Miller talked with me working to explain what would be done to my back. The information was expressed clearly and I'm comfortable with the procedure. Been going to her for several years-she's a Good and caring doctor.|Miss Robin beavers is such an amazing, compassionate, caring, understanding dr as well as a very amazing woman she will sit with you and talk with you. If you have any questions she's always there to answer you. She doesn't try and rush you out of the office to her. It is not just we are not just client or customers she truly wants to help people she does not judge she understands, and I cannot say enough about this Robin beavers. I've been with her for about five years now and seeing her every month I feel the same way.|She is very business like which turned me off at first! Sometimes I get a little smile from her!  She knows her stuff when diagnosing my problems.  She gives me a clear understanding of my problems and what course we'll be following. All the staff are polite and very helpful.|I unfortunately can't rate the doctor because I never had the opportunity to see one.  I never passed the waiting room to see one.  1st appointment I waited 45 minutes for them to do back office paperwork approval before I could be seen.  I elected to leave since the wait was long and I asked if they could reschedule me to allow them to get paperwork processed.   I received a call and I was rescheduled the for the following week.  I asked them at this appointment would I have wait or would I be seen without the longer wait time.  The response was no I wouldn't have a long wait.   Appointment day arrived and my appointment time was for 8am.  There was one person there before me.  They called this patient back, then another patient arrived afterwards who was called back in less than one minute.  I'm still waiting, another patient arrives rushing because they were stuck in traffic.  They called her back within 2 seconds!  I was over it because the lack of communication and me just waiting for what reason this time.   I tried to tell the young lady at the desk who walked off as she couldn't hear me call on her.  I just politely left as my time is valuable to me and I was missing time from work again only not be seen.  The office called me when I was halfway home saying they were ready to see me.  Again, my appointment time was 8am I arrived at 7:50am and they were ready for me at 8:35am!  The doctor was there and they were taking patients back who arrived well after me.  But the lack of communication just didn't help.   I called back and explained my reasons I left and the lady just ok and disconnected the call.

Warning to any new patients make sure have a free day to spend with the Covington location because the lack of communication and wait time didn't make me feel welcomed to this practice.|Dr Rosenfeld is a great Dr along with his staff that I have come to think of as family. They listen to your concerns and make procedures much more comfortable. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. I feel safe with them and have wonderful results with my chronic pain. They understand my pain and go the extra mile to help and try and come up with the help that I need. I know that I will always have the pain and issues that I have but feel good knowing they are there.
Lisa Batchelor|Dr. Kilday and the staff were excellent. He took time to go over my problem and provided feedback on my options for treatment. Dr. Kilday's knowledge gave me confidence in our plan. After a simple procedure I could walk again without pain or discomfort. I would highly recommend.|My wife and I see Dr Rosenfeld in Covington, GA. We also see his P.A., Mara Ehret, for office visits. Mara has been extremely helpful with her diagnosis and treatments. She has been spot on with the exams and recommendations to the Doctor.

Dr. Strauss is fast, efficient and has an exceptional bedside manner. He always makes pleasant conversation and always listens when my husband or myself voice new concerns. I highly recommend this practice for anyone suffering pain.|I've been seeing Dr. Strauss for years, he is by far the best pain specialist I've ever had. He makes sure that the medication will NOT be too much. I'm so thankful for Dr. Strauss, he actually saved my life by getting me on the CORRECT medication and dosage . Thank you Dr.Strauss and the entire staff.|I saw 4 different pain management Drs before I found Dr Strauss and I'm so glad I found them ! Every Dr I saw before him would just write scripts and send you on your way but Dr Strauss listen to everything I said he made ajustments to my medicine that allowed me to get off the strongest stuff and not suffer. The Staff is fantastic Lisa , Dana , Ricky everyone I have had the pleasure of meeting has been so helpful and positive.I would recommend them to anyone that is suffering.|It is hard to find a doctor who cares. I am happy to say that I found one with Dr. Strauss.  He has helped me through some of the worst pain I have ever experienced.  He is careful with my time, yet thorough. I have gone through so many doctors in the past year or so with the herniated discs in my neck, back pain, shoulder problems and rheumatoid arthritis. He makes sure we are on the right track. If we are doing things that do not work, he adjusts. He listens to what I say. Though I still have to see several doctors, he is by far the best one. The one that has helped the most.|Staff is so friendly and after a couple of visits they remembered my name! It's so nice to be remembered and not just a client number! No waiting and waiting either. Dr Straus is timely but he does listen  and examine if I'm having issues other than just bad pain days. On my first visit he reviewed my radiology reports from the MRIs and notes from my general practitioner then he did his own assessment as well. He's offered medication and procedure options so I have a bit of a choice with my treatments and what I can afford. He is a very kind Dr and it's obvious he loves what he does as he's always friendly! It's a referral only practice but if you need pain mgmt I highly recommend this clinic!|Tried to get an appointment with DR. Morrison but since it was an auto accident I can't get treated. My question is what different does it make how someone gets hurt?  Injured is injured! That makes no sense. I guess if you jump off a building you can get an appointment but if you have a car accident they want nothing to do with you.|Great customer service from ALL staff.  Dr. Morrison is very compassionate, kind, professional, & has taken care of my very complex health issues for nearly seven years.
The staff at NGPC goes well above & beyond to help me stay as functional as possible.  Which in & of itself is next door to a full on miracle.
There amazing folks have supported me through the best & worst of times.  And never once has anyone @NGPC Ever made me feel less than fully appreciated.
There just aren't enough words in the English language for me to express how very much I appreciate this group of VERY EXTRA ORDINARY Medical Staff!  From booking appointments to having procedures done & all in between, I don't believe anyone could ask for better.
My Heartfelt thanks to ALL @NGPC.|This place is a joke if you don't have any medical insurance. Dr Strauss had my long term disability cut out because he said he didn't see how I couldn't work. I had my primary Dr refer me to a spine specialist with Harbin clinic. My first appt there was April 3, he wanted to do surgery on April 6. Ended up having it on April 13 because of financial reasons. Thanks to Dr Strauss, we are in more of a bind now since he never examined me. He walked in handed me a rX and walked out. I tried telling him on several occasions on what I was feeling and he didn't care. He just told me when I get insurance we would discuss it further. If you just going for the pain meds then he's your guy. If you really want help go to Harbin Pain Mgmt. They screen the applicants and if they accept you, then you will get an appt.  Hopefully he will be shut down!! The ladies up front were very nice though.

God Bless|Everyone at this office is amazing. Starting at the front desk, Jocelyn, Kristen or Vickie greet you warmly as you come in and treat you as a valued person, even remembering your name. The triage team, who are often overlooked for the good job they do, is always very caring and attentive to your needs and getting you back as soon as possible. Next you are seen by a nurse, another very sweet. intelligent staff member who asks lots of important questions about your health, family and life making sure the doctor has all the important information he/she needs as well as building a good relationship with their patient. The doctor I see is great, Dr. Vaid. He has treated me for 3 years and helped me manage my pain so that I can live life and not let the pain control me. He has performed several procedures on me and done so well I didn't need sedation. There is also a woman named Jennifer who checks in on the patients and is one of my favorite staff members. She asks any questions that may have been missed and checks in on your personal life as well, developing better relationships with the patients.  As I stated I have been with them over 3 years and I would recommend this Office, Family, to anyone that reads this.

PS - Whoever wrote that review for Debra Meadows is totally wrong about the wait times. As for the 15 minutes most doctors do that as a courtesy, they see lots of patients and ask that you come 15 minutes early to avoid that and delay the person after you.  It sounds like someone had a bad day and seeing them talk like that about such a great office that I love bothers me because it isn't true.|My mother had a procedure done without anesthesia and had the most horrible operation and post op experience, they again tried to schedule her another procedure with no anesthesia with their excuse being that they don't have an anesthesiologist to work for them currently. Don't do a procedure on my mother where she is screaming in pain from a back procedure no anesthesia and you have to turn up the music in the office so people in the waiting room don't hear her crys. Shameful.|I recently moved from IN to GA.  I Have been seeing a neurologist for years and I dreaded having to get a new Dr.  The office staff is great  the nursing staff too.  Dr. Valid is Awesome!!  He's  punctual and very thorough.  He has a wonderful  bedside manner.  My husband was impressed too.  I am really happy to have found this place.|Impressive first visit
Dr. Kassamali and his assistant, Jeremy, were very pleasant and informative during my initial visit with this practice.  I felt very comfortable and that I was being taken seriously.  I felt I could trust them to have my best interests in mind.

Dr. Vaid and his staff have always been attentive to whatever my chronic pain I was feeling at the time.  Four stars instead of five reflects on the facility, not the staff.  They are always so busy  treating patients that it becomes obvious they need more staff, better phones (the on hold recording is awful) and an IT upgrade. I also would recommend the White Oak surgery  center. Always a good experience there as well.|I honestly love this place. The staff is very professional and nice and Dr. Polk is absolutely wonderful. Very patient, he explains what he's going to do and makes sure you understand. He also listens and makes you as comfortable as possible when doing the procedure. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone in need of a great doctor. Dr. Polk is one of a kind..|Dr Vaid is one of the most talented and compassionate doctors I have ever met.

Dr Robinson has no empathy and is an arrogant individual that treats everyone as if they are a drug dealers or criminal.  My husband has been disabled from a debilitating disease for more than 20 years now and our life has not been so easy.  It is unlike me to wish any harm to another human being, but I feel like if this doctor had a family member himself that was going through what my husband and I have been going through the last 20 years and are currently going through he would have more empathy.  Dr. Robinson you are sworn in your profession to ""do no harm"" as a principle of medical ethics and is your obligation as a physician.  Dr. Robinson, please be mindful that your actions, words and the way you express yourself to others harms others. The act to ""do no harm"" simply conveys several moral rules - do not kill, do not cause pain or suffering, do not incapacitate, do not cause offense and do not deprive others of the goods of life. We'll you Dr. Robinson need to take a very good look at the ethics you swore to uphold because you fall very short of maintaining the moral rules.

Our community just went through a tragic event this week (school shooting) and people every day commit suicide because people just think of themselves and not how they treat others. You are supposed to ""HELP"" people in need and make them feel safe.  Your words, actions, and your lack of empathy for others cause people to feel the opposite.

I write this not to be revengeful but to warn my fellow community of your actions, your lack of care, empathy and especially your lack of upholding your obligation.  I do hope and pray that no one else has to feel like we have been made to feel and that you take a hard look at yourself and how you carry yourself.  These are real people (not all are drug addicts) with real painful issues and diseases that just need someone / someone in your profession to actually care. Please do yourself and your entire staff a huge favor and schedule sensitivity training!

I did not post this review or hide my name because I have nothing to hide and want the community to know ""We are real people just like you and I hope no one treats your family the way you have treated my husband.""

Be Blessed!
Sonia Sewell|This clinic is the sister to the one I went to in Florida and I expected the same great staff and doctor. Well that didn't happen. This doctor had the nerve to question my drug allergies even saying he might make me get allergy testing. The staff has no sensitivity training and the billing is farmed out to a company in the Midwest. The procedure authorization and billing departments are abysmal! 3 months before I got refunds for copays (they didn't think I checked my EOBs) and they claim they either didn't get an authorization approval (I get one in my email from insurance 7 days prior to procedure) from insurance or they submit the wrong procedure for approval causing a denial for treatment.
Just saying think twice before using this pain management clinic.|I don't know what has happened to this practice over the last year but I can tell you I will NEVER refer them to anyone again. It's not the Doctor's or the medical staff it's the billing and people over them. They now no longer let you carry a balance and make payments on it then they turn around and charge 100.00 dollars for a drug test. Those who are self pay because we don't have insurance can't afford the extra 100 dollars and the reason they charge that much is because of the insurance companies.
This company that has taken over this practice is nothing but corporate greed taking advantage of people who have to have their services. People are struggling right now and and instead of helping their patients that have been there for years they're doing all they can to create even more of an economic hardship. I want to stress again it's NOT The Doctors or the medical staff they are amazing. Now I have to decide where I'm going to have to take the extra 100 out of maybe my power bill or rent to pay for what should only cost 30.00 to remain a patient because unfortunately I need the medicine to have any kind of quality of life.|Dr Jorge Alvear is very good and professional, he listens and all way understand about my pain . He is excellent speaking espanol. But please Dr call back when we leave a message, we know you are busy person but we call cause we really need you help.
Staff always treated me with respect. Especialmente Rosa.
Thanks for your job !|When Dr. Lena Lake left the practice, I thought no one would be able to believe in my issues and give me the care I truly need for my spine. However, Dr. Jorge Alvear became my doctor and he always took me seriously, believed me when I told him about my ongoing muscle cramps and pain in my spine, and trusted me above other specialists and doctors who made false reports on me. Then, he left and there are no good doctors and/NP's or PA's at the practice. I've stayed with them for 7 months and I have decided to go back to Dr. Alvear, even if it's going to be 2hrs longer drive because I place my total faith in him.|Dr. Chaundry is great, but the front desk staff are a joke and literally can not do the simplest of tasks. All voicemails are ""disabled"" so you can't leave a message and even if you could they wouldn't call back.|If I could give no stars I would .. when Dr Crider was there he was amazing However since he has left and his whole staff this place is a joke!!! Dr Robinson is an arrogant jerk that treats people like they are criminals and Dr Alcvear was my Dr after Dr crider left he was okay the one time I had an appt w him However he discharged me from the program without letting me know and for no reason advised I didn't follow protocol because I accidently left my medication in TN at when I went for Thanksgiving at the hotel so I needed a refill a few days sooner that is why I was discharged w no notice from anyone I have called the office manager Sandra several times she will not return my call or my new Dr faxes or phone calls this place is a joke save your self and find another Dr these people here are useless and care about nothing!!! Also they would not provide me or my new Dr my discharge paperwork where I can get anymore medicine this should be illegal what they are doing|I have had excellent experiences with both Dr Crider and Dr Robinson. I came in about 6 months ago with excruciating pain in my neck and also my lower back. Both providers were very attentive, have excellent bedside manner, and are gentle during examinations and all 4 of the spinal injection procedures I've undergone so far. I am doing so much better, the pain is much more manageable, and I feel SEEN and HEARD by the doctors and staff at Specialty Spine & Pain.

They have been able to help control my pain while simultaneously lowering the amount of narcotics I need to take by using alternative medicine to make me comfortable. The staff is wonderful and since they have little turnover I see the same people every month. I really appreciate Dr. Mark Ellis, he talks to me like an equal and is very knowledgeable about my case and the options available to me. He is wonderful person and truly cares about his patients. I see them every month and it's more a social visit rather than a medical visit and enjoy seeing the staff. Although my favorite person there is Diane who assist Dr. Ellis in procedures. She has been there longer than me and she is a ray of sunshine  everytime I see her. She helps my anxiety to calm before procedures. Would recommend Ellis Pain Management to anyone who wants options to help control daily pain management.|I came here to do a review of both Courtney, the nurse practitioner and Danielle the medical assistant. They are both so good to work with. Danielle gets me back as quickly as possible and is very professional while also being warm and friendly. I really feel like she is concerned for the patients. And a little friendly chat on the side doesn't hurt.

I cannot say enough good things about Courtney. I have been seen Courtney for a few years now and she is always so kind, friendly, and yet very professional. I not only feel like Courtney cares about her patients, I know Courtney cares about her patients. She treats the whole patient. Of course, she's concerned about the medical things and the pain that's going on, but she also is concerned about personal things in my life. She knows that wellness is a big package of mind, body, and spirit. Like I said there's so many things I could say good about Courtney that this would be a very long review. I highly recommend Courtney to anyone and everyone.|I am a disabled veteran and I am a patient of Courtney Hinson NP-C and RN Danielle. They are truly professional, courteous and compassionate. They really care about your health and overall well-being, I truly look forward to my appointments with them at Ellis Pain Center. They are truly awesome and I thank Courtney and Danielle for being there for my pain management needs. Tyrone Sebastian Huff|Been going there for years, always been easy to get along with everyone.
I wish more doctors offices had more employees like Dr Ellis has.
Thank you Dr Ellis keep up the good work.|Courtney and Danielle are the bomb. I look forward to every appointment. They always greet me with a smile and make me feel at home. It's a pleasure with everyone at Ellis pain center. I've been a patient probably since they opened. Have never had a bad experience.|I truly love The Staff  they have been there for me. Courtney and Danielle and My favorite Nurse.. I Appreciate everything  they have  done  for me. This is one of the best place  to come to get the best Medical care..

You. Are Appreciate|Ellis pain center is great. They take the time to get to know you and help you with your pain management. All the staff is friendly. Ms. Danielle and Ms. Courtney especially put you at ease and listen to what you have going on. Absolutely a great group of people!|If you're thinking about going to this Ellis pain management, please don't go. This pain management has tried to mess me up from seeing any other pain management because I wanted to leave them. The nurse practitioner, Courtney Henson yelled at me and stormed out of the Room that I was in because I said I will release this office. First Courtney said that there was going to go down on my medicine and then when I went back, they took me all the way off the medication that I was on. I asked her about the change and why am I being taken off the medication. I told her that I was there for almost 5 years she says SO we have patience that have been with us over 20 years. I told her I understand but I'm talking about myself. She said either you get off the medicine or sign the paper to leave our office and at this point she was yelling at me. I said I have never been treated like this before she said either you accept what we say or leave. I said well I will sign the papers to be released not because we're changing medication's but because you lied and said we just gonna go down on the medicine, and because you are yelling at me she got up walk out and slammed the door. When I was looking for other pain management to go to. Because I sign the release form from Ellis Pain when they asked for my records from Ellis they said that I was difficult, I did not want to go down on medication's. 2 of the office refused to see me because of what they said about me. I had to beg an office to see me and I told them my side of the story in order for them to give me an appointment. Please I beg you please do not go to Ellis pain management because they will destroy you if you try to leave or if you ask them any questions about them lying to you that is a problem for them. I RATE this office the worst pain management office EVER. They really are trying to destroy me and my character. I am seeking attorneys about this matter as today because I just got word another pain office do not want to see me because of what they said about me. They lied on ME  .

UPDATE: they did not want to continue a conversation with me, they sent me a threatening letter. The letter was from Dr. Ellis himself, he was very rude and told me I can never come back to his facility. I was not planning on coming back, I have already found a new Pain Doctor that is very excellent. Dear Dr. Ellis, if you wanted to talk to me so I can take this post down you should have called me.

He is the first physician who could manage my cervical and lumbar  injuries where others were not successful.  Dr. Dammanna uses conservative treatment and the highest quality of care.

I have read several of the reviews regarding the office staff.  In my experience I have not found this to be true.  When making an appointment I have had to leave a message on occasion and my call has been returned with in the same day or the follow business day. I have never waited two days.  I did have to reschedule an appointment because I WAS LATE due to unforeseen circumstances. The front desk worked with me to reschedule for the next available appointment.

Procedures are handled very professionally and I have had issues with my insurance and the staff has been amazing appealing denial of services  when they truly do not have to. They were doing it as a courtesy.   Once approved and the day of my procedure all of the surgical staff was so kind, caring and also professional. I do hope you have a wonderful positive experience as I have. had.  Thank you Pain Physians of Atlanta|I have been under the care of Dr. Ravi Dammanna for the last 12 years. Throughout this time, I have undergone several neck and joint surgeries and have dealt with chronic pain stemming from a car accident many years ago. Dr. Dammanna and his surgical team have profoundly improved my pain levels and mobility over the years. They are compassionate and attentive, taking the time to review my MRI and explain what is happening so that I can fully understand. The surgical team is top notch and truly cares about how they prep patients for procedures.  Dr. Dammanna has performed numerous procedures for me, providing substantial relief and allowing me to continue activities without surgery.  I am so grateful for this practice and appreciate Dr. Dammanna's honesty with me about my medical conditions.  PPof A is an Excellent practice that I highly recommend.|Dr Damamna was my doctor and I could not have been more pleased. He was very honest and informative at visit before my procedure. His team was great from checking until I left. The entire team was so pleasant, friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this group to any of my family or friends.|I sincerely appreciate how they treat their patients.  Dr. Ravi Damamna is my physcian. He truly listens to his patients, is sincerely compassionate when things are serious, goes the extra mile when the need arises, and his team rate a 5-star in my book!  The entire staff is amazing.  I feel very lucky to have been referred to them.  He has kept me from having to have more spinal surgery for many years and am very grateful!  Thanks Pain Physicans of Atlanta!!|I was referred by my oncologist because of the constant pain from radiation.  Dr Wada is completely laid back, making me more relaxed, still hurt like...
He went through several oral med options, nothing worked. We then tried the spinal cord stimulator.  BINGO.  Finally something that eased a huge percentage of the agony I've dealt with for almost a year. That was the temporary unit, (an insurance hoop to see if it did anything)  I'm scheduled for my permanent unit, next week.  I am totally looking forward to being able to sit to eat, walk and everything else I've forgotten about.|I have been seeing Dr. Ravi Dammanna for many years for chronic migraines, and he is amazing! He really listens and wants to help his patients.  His staff has been great especially with the med shortages! I am very thankful for them because migraines have caused me to have to miss out on a lot of things and events. Now with proper pain management and figuring out triggers, I don't have to miss out on life!|PaIn Physicians of Atlanta is a top notch professional Healthcare organization. I survived Lung Cancer in 2011 only to have a lot of issues with my back and Dr. Ravi Dammanna has enabled me to live a quality life without pain for which I am forever grateful. He is such a kind, knowledgeable, compassionate doctor who always listens to me and makes suggestions and together we come up with a plan.

Recently I started having severe pain down my left leg shortly before leaving for vacation and he was able to order an MRI, get the results and work me in for a steroid epi 2 days before we left. The steroid epi, completely eliminated my leg pain and several months later, I'm still pain free. Very few if ANY other doctor could have pulled all that off so quickly!

His surgical team (especially Caleb) is so nice and calming. I feel like I'm visiting old friends when I go in as they are always so kind and actually talk to me when I enter the surgical room. Some healthcare providers forget how important that is-not Dr Dammanna and his fabulous team!

I like to remind Dr Dammanna and my incredible Neurosurgeon Dr Charles Weaver that my Thoracic Surgeon and Oncologist may have saved my life but THEY made my life worth living with their outstanding kindness and skills.

I trust Dr Dammanna completely and have recommended several friends to him.|Suffering with sacroiliac joint pain for several years, going for numerous physical therapies and taking meloxicam with no relief, my first appointment with Dr. Dammanna convinced me I found the right team to help me. He reviewed my MRI and explained every detail of the cause of my pain and options for treatment. I had sacroiliac joint injection twice. After the first dose the pain was still mostly there but the second injection managed 90% of it. Dr. Dammanna and his nurses make a great team before, during, and after the procedure.

DS|I have been going here for over 2 years. I had been going to another pain clinic that was helping me (more then just pain meds), the doctor quit, and so I decided to seek another physician. I found a clinic who for almost 2 years did nothing but gave me pain pills, it was during the sickness...lol. That doctor just gave meds no other options. I finally was using a walker & a scooter on my hardest days. My Nurse Practioner brought up this clinic    referred me to Dr. Eric Pulito  I went in with attitude, I told him I didn't want the medication i wanted to get better. He was great. He told me they could help me more then just pills.  I Love Them 
I am not  getting any worse, I still use the walker & scooter at times (for long days out). Not like before. I am certainly walking more. There are options they discuss with you, explaining every procedure. I get relief, i didn't get before. This clinic has given me hope and a life again. I can not say enough positive praise. They are all very special that work there. They treat you with respect and not like you are just there for medications, your there to get better, and they will do what they can to help you achieve your goal.|Summit Spine is the best Dr's office I've ever had!!!!

Thank you to all.|One of the worst patient care experiences I have ever experienced. The doctors themselves could be outstanding, however the staff member responsible for intake and scheduling (Sherry?Shelly? I genuinely can't recall) is just awful. I had a lumbar puncture at Piedmont hospital and they sent a referral to pain consultants of Atlanta and told me to call shortly after and ask if it was possible to be seen that day for a blood patch. I waited a while and called- but the woman I spoke to not only was condescending and rude, but when I explained why I was calling she huffed and said ""yeah I got one yesterday for that- where do you live- yeah that's not you"" making it clear she hadn't bothered to call that received referral either. She abruptly told me ""that's not how things work"" when I said Piedmont had said to ask about getting in asap. She said she would call me when my information was received. I never heard from her, and followed up with the hospital who assure me they had sent it and told me when. The weekend passed with me in significant pain and unable to do much more than lay flat and hope I didn't move too quickly or cough or sneeze. I called back Monday morning around 11 am. Someone else answered there and yelled over asking if anything had come in with my name and did they want to talk to me. I was put in the phone with the same woman as Friday. She said yes she received the info, then asked me when I had the procedure and explained it had been Wednesday and I bad initially called Friday morning. Her response was ""it's been FIVE days- you don't feel better?"" She proceeded to say they didn't have any openings and she would have to talk to her supervisor and call me back. That was Monday morning- it's Thursday and I haven't received a call. I would hope those running this office would look into this as I can't think this is a one off situation.|Very professional and patient focused team. Great patient care from provider and staff. I accepted a referral for continued care with an epidural steroid not knowing anyone of the providers or clinical staff prior to my scheduled procedure and was well taken care of throughout my visit!

I was a patient there for 5 years while living in Georgia, and my experience was exceptional.  Dr. Mitchell is incredibly knowledgeable and truly outstanding at what he does.  Since moving out of state and switching to a new doctor, I can absolutely feel the difference - my pain was much better managed under Dr. Mitchell's care.  The multiple injections I received allowed me to function without constant discomfort, something I haven't experienced elsewhere.

Dr. Mitchell is not only a brilliant physician but also one of the kindest doctors you could ever meet.  He takes the time to explain everything in a way that's easy to understand and always makes you feel comfortable.

I highly recommend TDI Pain over any other practice.  Unlike the large network-owned facilities where patients can feel like just a number, TDI Pain truly cares about each individual.  Thank you, Dr. Mitchell and TDI Pain, for your exceptional care!

Respectfully,
Emily Coffey|My experience with TDI pain and Dr. Mitchell have been one of the most rewarding experience. When I 1st met him that day he told me he would do all he could to help ease my pain. And now years, later, he is still taking good care of me. I love Dr. Mitchell and all the staff. Terry is very tentative to his patients and the girls that get you set up for the procedures are sweet as they can be. I am very happy and pleased with my visits. I love my PA Robin. she defiantly understands my pain. love all these folks!
Donna Estes|They are good at getting enough people, more than an enough to an enormous amount of money coming in. I was a patient for I think about a year & after getting talked into a different pain meds for a few months, ended up with many side affects & instead of going back to my original meds, I again prescribed a different one that needed to be approved by my insurance & IT WAS NOT! Of course instead of going back to my original meds they made the decision to keep me on the meds that gave me side effects, today on this day I have NO! pain meds to take so that I have NO quality of a life since my insurance company & doctor took & made my decision for me. NO ONE AT EITHER PLACE LISTENED OR CARED FOR ME, MY WELL BEING OR HOW I FELT! TDI has thousands of patients & couldn't give a hoot if I didn't stay in their practice.

THIS IS SO VERY & EXTREMELY UNCALLED FOR! I have been to every single doctor I was recommended to go to to see if there was something that could help me get out of my daily & extremely awful pain so I could I could live the rest of my life with some comfort & not the pain I experience now. Prayer & the Lord is my only hope left in my situation as GOG IS IN CONTROL!
Blessings & prayers & hope for all who can relate to my situation & daily pain!!|They are SCAMMERS (and they are proud of it!)!  If you have a personal injury case due to a crash, the schedulers will tell you that they work off of ""Letters of Protection"" (LOPs) but then when you go for your visit, they force you to pay out-of-pocket!  Richard (""CFO"") sees the patients and he tells the patient a completely opposite story and makes them pay for their visit and medications upfront!  Even if the patient is out of work and does not have an income.  Beware of this place because it seems like they say one thing to you in order to get you in the door, and then they tell you something else once they have you in the visit!  I would not refer ANY patient to this place after learning how poorly they treated one recently!|Been going here for years. I used to really enjoy my visits. The ppl were so nice, but that's not the case anymore. Yes, I began to complain when they put me with a young PA that wasn't even old enough to understand the pain that I deal with. Then reception is the worse. After you're labeled a troublemaker for expressing your opinion, they made me wait 2 hours before giving me my prescription..totally on purpose. I am fond of, Dr. Mitchell. I only wish I could say the same for his current staff.|I love everything about TDI Pain. They are the only place that has attempted to help me with my pain issues. The provider I have now is amazing she truly listens to me and doesn't try to push medication! I love seeing Dr. Mitchell when I have procedures done he is always in a great mood and very caring!|I drive 2 hours one way to go here. I see Tya, a nurse practioner for office visits & Dr Mitchell does all of my procedures. And i absolutely love them both, they make it worth the drive. The staff is awesome.  Antwonette, Zack & Penny are always very nice & go above & beyond for the patients. My 3 complaints would be: difficult to get thru when calling, wait time is often extensive, procedures scd too far out. I've been making the 4 hour round trip for several years now. The pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion. They are worth it The CFO (I think is his title) Richard, will try his best to do anything & everything he can to help you out|I had an app with both offices today. All they staff was courteous as they could be. Dr. Mitchell is wonderful, goodness I can't remember his name right now. It's the guy that puts you too sleep, he is wonderful.

Laneisha is great, I am so thankful, I got her a my new NP.

I refer my friends to him and they to have been impressed and happy with the treatment they have received and the way they were treated as a whole.|The back injections I got yesterday hurt considerably more than the first ones I received last year. I was a patient at this facility about 4 years ago. I arrived for my appointment and was taken back for prepping. When I left the facility that day 4 years ago, I decided to never go back. It felt like the doctor had used my back as a dartboard. That's exactly the way I felt yesterday. I will be attending the February 4th appointment with the PA. He should expect to get an earful.|The complete medical staff as well as the complete office staff are competent, efficient, polite and especially caring. I've been a patient since 2018 and would not consider going anywhere else!|Dr. Bovient is probably the most arrogant person I have ever met. I was there to talk about my Nalu stimulator and he wanted to talk about his leg day! His clothes are incredibly tight and he walks around like a deity of pain medicine (over compensation maybe???). He actually moved my Nalu stimulator to a worse location, and when I was struggling in the healing process, he couldn't have cared less. His bedside manner is that of an ape and I would rather deal with my pain than visit him again.

Also, the front staff is SOOOOO unfriendly. I was there several mornings when the receptionist didn't even look like she had bothered to brush her hair. Every interaction left an impression on me like I was bothering them by asking for them to do their job. My husband also had constantly fight with billing, even after we had met my deductible. It was as if no one in that office knew how to do their job. The office manager was the only shining light, but I had to go through several steps to get acknowledged by her and get my questions answered. The staff needs customer service training and Dr. Bovient needs to worry a little less about his EXTRA tight pants and his workout and worry a little more about his patients' overall care.|I've been dealing with chronic pain for years - struggling to find the right care to treat it. I've only been to this office maybe 3 times now. However, at each visit Dr. Delva has treated me with nothing but respect and has taken his time with me listening to my concerns and giving me helpful information. At my last visit, he told me that he really hopes they can do right by me and help me, which that alone meant the world to me. I have nothing but good things to say about him. Thank you Dr. Delva!|Dr Delva is wonderful!  His assistant, Shante, is amazing as well!  They are so caring and helpful!

He is very series about finding the correct solution for you individually and that he's not ""ignoring"" you as some other reviews state but typing in every word you say into your chart to not miss a thing. He has helped me and I tried to find help for my condition for YEARS and nothing ever changed. I felt like just a number and they just treated all patients the same and spent 2 minutes with me and that's it. My injections help me so much and I can finally sleep through the night with the treatment plan he has used for me. I love his staff.   He cares and he will find a way to help you if possible, you have to let him take the notes and ask the questions because he is listening and will do the right thing for you.|Dr Allen. Is a great doctor
He take the time to help you with all of your issues. He take the time to input everything into the system so he does not miss anything. He is to the point but this doesn't make him  a bad guy. He offers other help for you pain like procedure that helps a lot. along with physical therapy.  I have suffered with Lupus and other complications for years now.

You have to follow all the rules and he will help you.|Going to Dr. Idi Allen was one of the worst doctor experiences that I have in my 62yrs. Dr. Allen was unfriendly, cold, Un compassionate, uncaring, tried to belittle and degrade me in every way he possibly could. I would ask him questions and he would respond with be quiet I am typing. He didn't like me from our very first visit and he made sure I knew that every time I went to my appointments. I went to my appointment the day after getting out of the hospital in the ICU for RSV and one of his staff came down to get me when I called for a wheelchair (which was very nice). When he came in the room for our visit and saw me in the wheelchair he asked me sarcastically what was wrong with me now? The same appointment day my blood pressure was 225/119 and he said and did NOTHING about it (doctors are suppose to send you to the hospital or call EMS when a patient has blood pressure that high and he did not). On top of his nasty attitude, every time I went to my appointment he threatened to just stop my medicine cold turkey and discharge me. He was a very mean and wicked doctor and one of the worst doctors I have ever encountered. On top of all of his terrible traits and attitude, he made NO secret in anyway that he is extremely with out a doubt prejudice against white people. I wouldn't recommend Dr. Allen to my worst enemy or ANYONE. THE WORST EVER!!!|I came back to this doctor to get records referring to a car accident and it has been over six or seven months have nothing to not heard from anyone from this office.

If this is bellied up and gone bankrupt I would like to know so that I can indeed get my records that I require in order to go before jury.

I'd like to add to the reply, it is my wife and she has not been seen in years it was last year and she had to go to Emory because she ran out of medication and the doctor went silent on her with no reply and no concern for the patient. The attorneys did not get all records-and some dates are wrong. She went in person to get the records but the place was closed.|Dr.Allen has helped my father in ways I can not describe.  He couldn't walk for long, stand or even sleep. He went to see Dr.Allen and he checked every possible thing that could be wrong with him.

Also, their procedure office (attached in tandem to the normal pain management office, and the procedure office is called ""Salubrious"") is wonderful. The nurses and the staff for my radio frequency ablation procedures on my spine have always been informative, kind and they put in the effort to care for you and remember you.

My wife and I spent a lot of effort and time into choosing the right pain management doctor, as I'm young, only 28, and have multiple diseases that can complicate things, so we did not just simply want a doctor that prescribes meds and gets rid of me. Dr Rubin is exactly what we had hoped for and more.

I can say Dr. Rubin and ALL of his staff are respectful, they take the time to find the right treatment for each person, and they take appropriate and strong precautions to ensure the medication (if prescribed) is being taken appropriately (I.e. random urine tests, pill counting, etc). It is encouraging to have a doctor's office for my pain issues that cares enough to ensure proper therapeutic usage of prescribed medications.

Literally he is the kindest and most patient doctor I've ever met, and has worked diligently to get me back on track to being able to spend a bit more time with my family instead of simply always being in pain.

Thanks to everyone at Physician Pain Care & Salubrious.

-Luke|I remember a time when the world was a different place. Doctor's actually would greet the patient with a smile. Doctor's wanted to find the best solution to your issue. They would take the time to listen to your concerns, because you really mattered to them. People never forget, how you made them feel. Dr. Rubin, is an expert in his profession. What I'm most impressed by is, his integrity, and the way he makes his patients his top priority every visit. The office, as well as the staff are always extremely professional, and inviting. Thank you Dr. Rubin for recognizing that, those characteristics are still important today.|I have been suffering with nonstop pain for almost a decade (I am in my mid 30's), been seen by over 10 different doctors with different specialties across the US, and Dr. Rubin has been the only one to listen to what has been happening, and not just prescribing opiates. Many of the other doctors just prescribe opiates and call it treatment. Dr. Rubin took the time to ask the questions and talk game plan. He listened to my concerns, and answered all of my questions. I could not be happier with the treatment and the staff. I was finally able to receive a proper diagnosis, and treatment all in one location, with the same doctor and staff. Having the nerve block injections has been life changing. I can finally and honestly say for the first time in almost a decade I am pain free, and it is all thank to Dr. Rubin for listening. I could not be happier with everyone at this office.|BEWARE & BECAREFUL OF DR JEFFREY RUBIN. my recent pain mgmt provider lft his practice after 1 yr n i was haplessly handed off to a new Dr at Physician Pain Care, Dr Jeffrey Rubin. At first i was told my treatment would continue as it had been for the last 3 yrs,  but unfortunately he lied thru his teeth. N After the multiple incompetence n repeated mistakes from his office staff, messing up everything about my meds, the dosage, quantity n dates, which hadnt changedon for 3yrs. When i finally complained after coming to my wits end, Dr. Rubin met with me for the only time at my final appt to inform me he changed his mind and would not continue my care. Naturally I got upset n lost my temper n spoke the truth too bluntly n was basically kicked out of the practice n he did it in the meanest n most unethical way possible. He told me to find a new Dr n he chose to stop everything cold turkey instead of slowly weaning down off my meds in a safe manner n then outright lied on my Official Discharge Letter stating i was in ""Bad Standing"" which gave every new dr i tried to set up appts with, the easy excuse for them to not even meet me for a new patient appt. Lastly he refused to provide any meds to counter the side effects of immediate opiod detox, which he knew i would immediately start to experienc since I've been on these meds 4 over 2 decades following a car accident which i became legally disabled as a result of. Luckily my mom came w/ so at least i had a witness not on the Physician Pain Care's Payroll who also heard his lies n sorry excuses as well as his highly unethical medical behavior. Then add insult to injury, when i asked what I was supposed to do while I attempted to find a new Dr while unwillingly suffering from severe n immediate opioid detox, n how could I lessen my upcoming suffering? Dr Rubin then callously informed ""if"" i needed help, I could always go to the ER. I've dealt with chronic pain as my everyday way of life for 2 decades, so plz believe me when I say, if u choose to go under the medical care of Dr Jeffrey Rubin for any reason, u do so at ur own peril. Ull most likely suffer as i have suffered entirely unnecessarily cuz the man n his practice doesnt give a single solitary piece of crap of ur physical n metal well-being. the Hell I've endured since this happened on 1/25/25 till today, 2/20/25, was easily avoidable n ull eventually regret ever allowing Dr Rubin anywhere near u for the purpose of pain reduction, relief or real help of any kind. Good luck to u all. I pray u never experience the hell I went through while he ""cared for my medical needs"". Please, Beware n Becareful, he'll only help ruin ur life not improve it. At least thats exactly what he did to me n I fear thats what he'll do to I chose to share this story & review, cuz if even 1 person is saved from Dr Rubin's intentional failure to act accordingly as a human being n a supposed health care professional. N i could save even 1 indiv from his blatant diregard to his Hippocratic Oath of ""Do No Harm"". Then it's worth it.  next victim, I'm sorry, I mean patient.... I chose to share this story & review, cuz if even 1 person is saved from Dr Rubin's intentional failure to act accordingly as a human being n a supposed health care professional. N i can save even 1 indiv from his blatant diregard to his Hippocratic Oath of ""Do No Harm"". Then it's worth it. He and his office of ""Healthcare professionals "" made it clear in no uncertain terms that my current and future physical well-being was a no real big concern to him as a Doctor or a human being. My opinion n advice, stay away from Physician Pain Care n Dr Rubin, cuz regardless of the lies they spk, everyone i dealt with there had absolutely no issue leaving me to suffer alone n with zero help or advice for my future well-being n saw nothing wrong with the intentional n preventable upcoming suffering i experienced from detox from medications which there practice had provided me w/ for over a yr, but somehow I was the wrong one in this situation. Uve been warned.|I would highly recommend Dr Rubin for any pain management needs. He is highly skilled, patient and very good at explaining procedures.

After having a less than stellar experience with my previous spine/pain management provider, I was referred to Nova by my Neurologist.

I knew I was in the right place when I told Dr. Ram on the first day that I wasn't there to just get some opioids and go home. One of dearest Army buddies overdosed on them, and it's just not something in which I feel comfortable. Dr. Ram smiled and said ""Good! Because I don't like handing them out!"". I learned that opioids are but a single arrow in her quiver, but not always the go-to solution.

She is a terrific listener, and really took the time to understand everything that I was suffering from (not just physical issues). She and her office staff have done an impressive job not just in holistically treating me, but also making the entire experience as pleasant and relaxing as possible.

I simply cannot recommend them highly enough!|The office staff is so efficient. The doctors are always willing to listen to Whatever need you have. I would recommend this place for anybody that has back pain.|Great Experience! Very professional and methodical. Everything was explained well and even documented for additional record. The procedure was very seamless and I appreciated and respected their thoroughness of the process. It is always nice to have people who know what they are doing and provide friendly customer service as well with a smile.|I initially came in for lower back issues. Dr Ram is an incredible doctor and thoroughly explains everything. Danyelle is a charm; she is always smiling and in a pleasant mood. Her happy outlook makes the experience go that much better.

But the NPs seem to think everyone needs a procedure. If you don't  they tell you no meds. So if medication keeps you functioning everyday in a normal way, they don't want you here.|This was my first experience with a pain clinic.  After several months, I never saw a doctor.  No doctor explained my condition to me nor discussed treatment options. I was told that the doctor never comes to the Griffin office. To see him, I would have to go to Stockbridge.
My pain was well controlled with medication but I was told that I MUST submit to injections which were never explained to me, other than to say that sometimes it worked, sometimes it doesn't.
I told her that I did not feel my pain was bad enough for such an invasive procedure.  I was not given any input into my care.  She told me that's what their doctors demand. I don't do anything without the opportunity to research the procedure and the qualifications of who is working on me.  Because I did not agree to the more invasive and expensive procedure, I was kicked out of the practice with no discussion of next steps. I will find a clinic that meets my definition of proper patient care.|The front desk: 
The MA: 
The NP: 

I was made to feel like I was wrong for being a patient. I have an entire care team of four Specialists who are CARING, MAKE EYE CONTACT and SPEAK TO ME AS A PATIENT. I have been dealing with this disease for almost 2 decades and only recently started seeing pain management FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT!
I am the Director of Operations for a Healthcare company! I would never allow ANY OF MY STAFF TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT I EXPERIENCED!!!!
No one should ever feel like they have to explain their disease or why thrive and have a better quality of life on a particular treatment.

Thank you front desk staff for your care and concern as I stood there in tears!! You are a true professional and a kind human being. I felt heard.

ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AND OTHERS!!!
Never allow anyone to make you feel like a problem because you have a disease.|This Pain Management has been nothing but good to me. They have taken care of all of my needs. Doctor Seymore Is highly skilled and he will take the time to discuss and issues that you have. Plus the staff are wonderful and caring. I read a negative post about the needle going into the neck. Of course it's going to hurt, But not like it was described. Anyways Thanks to The Pain Management for all that you have done for me.|Dr Seymour is The Most Genuine and Compassionate Physician you will ever come across. His patients are always treated with the upmost care and respect and His priority has always been to give Me the best treatment as possible. Dr Seymour is very knowledgeable and well educated with today's technology in modern medicine. Everyone working in that office is very friendly and caring towards His patients and will go above and beyond to help with any specific needs you may have, you will know you have received the Best quality of care once you are there.  Dr Seymour is  A Prime example of A Physician who truly cares about His Patients.|Dr. Seymore was great. I was so nervous but he explained everything he was going to do before he did it. His staff was so nice and friendly, yet very professional.|I visited two other pain clinics before I came here 8 years ago. Dr. Seymore has done miracles where two other doctors have failed. I had back surgery about 11 years ago with metal rods and screws everywhere. I re-hurt my back after the initial operation and was having extreme burning in my left leg that totally incapacitated me. The short story is that Dr. Seymore gave me back some semblance of a normal life where others had failed. I will never let another doctor give me back injections and if Dr. Seymore ever leaves Pain Management Specialist Of Atlanta I will follow him where ever he goes. I want to thank Dr. Seymore, and P.A. Laren, and all the staff for the caring and effective services I have received. If you are looking for true professionalism and a truly caring knowledgeable physician look no further, make an appointment today to see Dr. Seymore and his staff.|Pain Management was ABSOLUTELY THE ULTIMATE WORST doctor's office I have ever been to. Dr. Seymore and Dr. White are most INCOMPETENT doctors I have ever had to deal with. Their patients are NOT patients that they care about, but ONLY CASH COWS!  Dr. White did numerous procedures on my left knee and during all that time he NEVER SAW MY KNEE AND TIBIA BONE WAS BROKEN! Dr. Seymore gave me an epidural on my neck and it was so painful I thought I was going to die on the table and I cried for 2 hours after. Another time he gave an occipital block, had his PA practice on me and she stuck the needle in my skull 4 times and I couldn't move my neck for a week.
Because for my benefit I went to another doctor to check on a different procedure I was thinking about doing since I had a lack of trust in Dr. White and Dr. Seymore at this time not having any procedures done by the other the discharged me from their practice leaving me high and dry with NO NARCOTICS AFTER THEM GIVING THEM TO ME FOR 2 yrs.

I love Dr Pleasant. He is a good listener and strives to apply his wealth of knowledge in order to control my pain. Stephanie the P. A. Is wonderful and always has a smile for everyone. Susan the front office worker is another person that xare about the patients that go here. If you are looking for a pain management team that will be there for you and all your pain needs. Look no further.|Dr Pleasant and his office staff are wonderful. Dr Pleasant is very easy to talk to and very personable. He took as much time with me as I needed and answered all of our questions. I highly recommend the Pain Consultants of Atlanta - Fayetteville office.|Dr Pleasant is the best!  He truly cares for his patients. He is very empathetic and works very hard to give them the best outcome. He has kept me going for a number of years now and I have no doubts that if it were not for his care that I would not be mobile. I highly recommend him.|I have attempted to schedule a new patient appointment with the Fayetteville office since October 23rd (today is November 21st) with no results.
I called the office on 10/23/24 and was sent to voicemail (I did not leave one at this time). I called again the next day on 10/24/24 where I left a voicemail requesting a call back. After never hearing back, I called again on 11/15/24 and left another voicemail. To be on the safe side, I also completed an Appointment Request form on their website at 2:45pm. Only 30 minutes later at 3:15pm I received a call from a lovely lady that acknowledged me and asked additional questions. She informed me I should receive a call back from their scheduler 1 to 2 business days later. She is the only good part of this upsetting situation. After not hearing back from them by the end of the 2nd business day (Tuesday, 11/19/24) I tried calling again only to yet again be sent to voicemail. It is now Thursday, 11/21/24 and their office has closed for the day and I have received no further communications from their office.
I have chronic pain from a genetic condition as well as a previous lumbar fusion. My grandmother was a patient before she passed almost a decade ago and my mother recommended this office based on that experience. The care team treated my grandmother with dignity towards the end of her life and so I wanted to have them assist me with my chronic pain. I'm sure the doctors are great based off of my mother's testimony and other reviews. But if you are wanting to establish care, you will not be contacted even if you are proactive with following up. I am left to assume that either their scheduling staff is incompetent (I feel awful for even typing that out) or they have made assumptions that I am drug seeking and think of me as less than human and not deserving of so much as even a response. Either way, others should rethink this office for pain management.
It should also be noted I rarely leave negative reviews. People who experience chronic pain deserve more decency as they struggle enough. Please do better moving forward.|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Pleasant!!! He's very personable and really detailed about my treatment(s) and always explains things in layman's terms. I would (and have) recommend Dr. Pleasant to anyone!!|Nathaniel Pleasant, MD Is a consumate professional. He is compassionate, caring, and has an excellent ""bedside"" manner.

I would recommend him to everybody that is in pain.
Thanks Doc.
Tommy  Dillard|I'm so glad I switched!

I just signed on with Dr. Crider at Origins. What a huge change from the doctor I was switching from! Everyone was so kind and welcoming. They had me do A LOT of medical history paperwork; which I think is a good thing. They're definitely not there to just dole out meds. Although, if needed, they will manage your meds.

The PA spent a good amount of time with me asking a lot of questions to get a good sense of my issues. Then, Dr. Crider came in and chatted with me for a good amount of time also. He ordered a test, we set up a follow up appointment, and took care of meds. Great visit!|Dr.Steve was very genuine and that's important for a patient.  I like that he offers different solutions to manage pain. This Doctor listened to me attentively and I didn't feel judged or embarrassed by my situation. I know this Doc is going to help me, I'm very grateful to be in his care.|Dr. Crider and his staff are all very kind and compassionate. They are friendly and there's a good energy in the office. Dr. Crider explains diagnosis and treatments in a way that is easy to understand. He walked me through my MRI results and explained every issue in great detail and answered all my questions. Dr. Crider is also very understanding that I do not want to take medications for pain and has provided alternatives as well as support in me finding solutions and cures for the source of the pain. Since my very first visit, I felt like I was in good hands.|Love Dr. Crider and staff. He's made me feel very comfortable in helping with my bank pain and provided multiple options on things we could try and not just throwing medicine at the issue. He provides the medicine however which I'm super grateful for but very nice knowing we have other things we can try to hopefully relieve my back pain to a more manageable level and after going through one back surgery and looking at the option of another facing me, I was very glad to find Dr. Crider to hopefully not have to go through that again. I've already had one back injection that has relieved my sciatica and due to a miscommunication had to go through the procedure without the anesthesia. Dr. Crider was super calm and confident and talked me through the entire thing even though I was unsure and very anxious. Knowing he gives me the option however for my next procedure to use different things such as once again doing it with nothing, valium, or anesthesia when my previous doctor gave neither of the last two options and made it feel like he only did the injections as a money grab (they didn't work either) rather than a tool to help with pain makes me feel so much better. I would definitely recommend this office to anyone suffering with back issues. The staff is really great too! If I have issues with appointments, medicine questions or any other concerns, they always are quick to respond. Rarely have I had to leave a message for a nurse to call me back and waited forever for a response, usually I can call and speak directly to someone instantly. I have only had to wait longer than 10 minutes to go back to a room after arriving only once also. I appreciate everything Dr. Crider and his staff are doing for me.|It is a great place to go too. The whole staff is very caring and respectful!! The doctor and nurses are wonderful too!!! Doctor Crider is very thorough and thoughtful. He found a fracture in my back when the surgeon and the radiologist didn't see it.

I can now somewhat live a more bareable life. The staff is super friendly and professional. Dr Taylor's bedside mannerism is stellar. If you are tired of living your life in excruciating pain, please give Dr. Taylor's office a call. Thank you so very much.|I've been with Dr Taylor since 2010 for my suboxone treatment and other treatments. I wish Dr Taylor was a full-service medical doctor degreed in all medical specialties because he is the best Dr I've ever had in all my 48 years. He does not treat you like a number. He sits down and calmly listens to your questions without rushing you and he doesn't get up to leave the room until the entire conversation is finished. His wife Nancy, is a nurse who works with him and she is a complete doll! If you're looking for a compassionate doctor who is thorough with you and is a good listener and communicates well, Dr Taylor is the Dr for you. A good Christian man and his staff is always kind.

2010-current|I could write a LOT about how happy I am with Comprehensive Pain Care, but I will try to summarize my feelings below:

Dr. Taylor is professional, compassionate, personable, interested in making sure your pain care is being managed; and from my perspective, one of the BEST DRs around.  I appreciate him taking the time to listen to me and making diagnoses that make sense and get you feeling better.  He should be named as one of the ""TOP TEN"" DRs!!

His staff is friendly, professional and always recognize you by name.  Thank you for all the things you do in the background!  I'm grateful for everyone at Comprehensive Pain Care.|Dr Taylor has been absolutely God sent to me. I have suffered with chronic back pain for almost 13 years . I had a failed back surgery in 2008. Dr Taylor is the first Doctor in all these years that has truly cared & listened to me! He has & continues to work diligently to control my pain. I feel so blessed to have found him & have him as my Doctor. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of a caring, compassionate Doctor who cares about his patients, listens & takes the appropriate actions to give you the best quality of life he can. If I could give him more than 5 stars I definitely would!|If you decide to visit Dr Taylor's office, be ready for inconsiderate, and condescending treatment by both his support staff and Dr. Taylor himself. You'll be talked to as one would speak to a small child. I went to one appointment and immediately realized I'd made a mistake.|I have been seeing Dr Taylor since 1997. I had a sinus surgery that damaged my Supraorbita Nerve and has cause me terrible pain since. I don't know what I would do without Dr Taylor. In 1998 he flew up to Johns Hopkins University Hospital where I was having experimental brain surgery just to give me support during the first couple of hours of surgery. The staff at Comprehensive Pain Center is also great. They actually care how you are feeling and greet you with a smile. Dr Taylor and his wife Nancy are two of the kindest most knowledgeable people I know when it comes to relieving pain.
Dr Taylor travels around the world giving seminars on pain relief. Most of his patients don't even know this because he's not the bragging or telling type. All I know is he the best pain management Dr around Atlanta.|I've been very happy with the doctor and the staff . It is obvious, very soon,  that doctor Taylor truly cares for his patients. The staff is wonderful and polite and it makes you feel like you're in a place that people really care. I feel better just being here. Keep up the good work!|Dr. Taylor and his staff are the most caring people ever! He has a heart of gold and I am so blessed that he is my doctor. May he practice for many more years because none of us want to lose him. God bless you Dr. Taylor and staff!

They listen and try to help. There is one young woman at the front desk (I'm sorry I don't know her name) who is extremely rude and dismissive. I also get no less than five reminders for each appointment.  For my last appointment on December 30, I got six reminders, three on Christmas Day, one during our Christmas dinner blessing.

David W.|I have been on the schedule here for a cortisone epidural for over a month.  The morning of the procedure I received a call that they were taking me off the schedule due to insurance denying the claim.  However, they admit to receiving the information from Insurance 4 days prior and made no efforts to contact me or correct this.  I called my insurance company and they said the claim was denied because the doctor did not file it correctly and had neglected to inform them I had been receiving chiropractic therapy for over 6 months since my car wreck.  After some time on the phone I was very angry and and clearly in pain when they simply refused to do the procedure.  So much for patient care and doing the right thing.  I was asked to get back in line and wait while they worked out fixing the mistake they made in the first place.  So now I am looking for another place to get this procedure.  There are several issues here.
1. When they called to schedule this we discussed the therapies I had received and they failed to relay this to the insurance company.

2. They received the letter of denial from the insurance company 4 days prior and waited until the morning of to call me and remove me from the schedule when this could have been resolved on Monday morning

3.  They have clearly shown that ALL they care about is money and not doing the right thing.

4.  They allowed me to go without food or water from 11pm the night before, pull my 17 year old daughter out of school for a ride back and forth (I was to be sedated), and alter my business calendar to suit this procedure.  When they had every opportunity to correct this the day before.

5.  Apparently when you are in pain and they have done nothing to fix or help you are expected to be calm cool and collected because God forbid they feel offended by your pain.  Don't worry though they will apologize for the inconvenience

He is intelligent, articulate, and empathetic to his patients needs and concerns. I was a Firefighter Paramedic for 28 years.

The front desk person assisted with my work up. After being worked up by friendly staff I met Dr Epps . He explained the findings of my MRI, performed the epidural today. The surgical staff were gentle and encouraging and talked me thru the procedures.. . More friendly Staff explained thoroughly  followup home care and then I was on my way home. Dr. Epps is great .|Really liked this doctor. He took the time to read my husband's complicated medical notes, explained his condition to us in an easily understandable way, and came up with a good plan of care.|The entire staff at Alliance Spine is wonderful. I've had two surgeries and I'm facing a third on my cervical spine. They've been attentive and caring regarding my extreme pain. (I have 4 herniated discs in my cervical spine that are pressing/pinching my spinal cord)
They listen, adjust as necessary, and never make you feel awkward or ashamed of needing pain management. Dr Epps has performed injection & epidural procedures for me, and I've been very satisfied with the results. He is kind and compassionate. I highly recommend both the Covington & Conyers locations!|Dr Epps spent time talking to me to see what my n concerns and pain level was. Just got home and am pain free so far.|I have been a patient of Alliance Pain and Spine Clinic for more than 10 years. I have sciatica and stenosis with extreme joint pain as a result of injuries from heavy weight lifting in my youth.

Yesterday was the first time I met and interacted with Dr. Epps. He was very personable as well as professional. I was impressed that he obviously knew my past diagnosis' although this was our first meeting. In other words he took the time to research my history before meeting.

He made suggestions about my pain medications and counseled with me. I found him thorough and likeable, he left me with a feeling of confidence that I was in good hands with a physician that cared. JIM ZIEGLER|Dr. Epps, all the nurses, and office staff are great! He has helped me tremendously with all the different procedures. I highly recommend Alliance Spine & pain management. I go to their Sugarloaf office.|Dr William Epps is very good doctor and he is expert in his work. I was in pain since 2019 and was not able to tolerate pain. I was not able to sit, stand and sleep probably without pain. I am quite better now. This is my sec procedure in which he burned my nerve and now, I am 70 to 80% recovered from my nerve pain which I think that it will work for 1 to 1 1/2 year based on my last procedure. His office staff is also very good. Dr Epps and his staff also take care of insurance and authorization approval. No need to worry about coverage and approval as well.|Dr Epps is the best.

Myself working in the medical field for 14 years as a clinical lead and RMA I had a tragic car accident in March of 2024 and after being in wonderful health for most of my life overnight it changed. After months of being in the hospital and multiple surgeries I had to learn a new lifestyle of now being a patient. I was referred to Dr Chi and his staff. I was so nervous my first visit but there was a front office staff member named Madison Thornton that seeing her smile and kindness made my anxiety and nervousness simmer down then meeting Dr Chi and his nurse I soon realized that this place was special and they listened to all my concerns. FNP Mary Bracken is absolutely amazing and I truly adore and appreciate her. It has almost been a year since I have been a patient here and I refer them to everyone even from my old practice I worked at I have let the physicians and my FNP know to send patients here. Today I had an appointment and @ 10 am and I accidentally left my cc at home and since I am now a cash pay patient my husband asked if he could run home which is 6 minutes away and the check in lady (not going to publicly name) was like no you have to reschedule your appointment when For 1 I am already here sitting in my chair waiting and my husband was going to go grab it she was adamant about telling us no ,but Madison Thornton there amazing front office staff member went above and beyond by helping us and I got to see my provider as well I was not taking back until 10:45 and my husband definitely had time to go get our payment method with time to spare but with being told no by the other front staff member multiple times we found a different payment method well we're forced to do so or not see my provider.Kindness doesn't cost anything and she is what makes this office worth coming to. As well as Lyric Ellis the MA in the back absolutely AMAZING. The heart of any practice starts from the front and goes to the the back. Those two women deserve a big raise and a special day off!!! And the only other suggestion I would have is for the other staff is to just have empathy for those of us that have had a life changing experience and we come here for help and to show a little more compassion. Other than that 5 stars for the providers and the staff that does show the patients genuine care.|The doctors are top notch!! Life changing and never condescending. The staff is lovely. The only issue I have is seeing different doctors a lot, and the practice is so large, it's hard to get prior authorizations and other forms you will need if you go to these sorts of docs. However, they absolutely work hard for you, you just have to stay on them a lot and stay on the phone more than should be. However, the doctors are absolutely worth your time.|I was told by a Dr nothing could be done so he sent me to Summit. They showed me something they could do and I am waiting on insurance to approve it. They get right to work on you because they know you are hurting. Everyone is super nice. Give it a try. You will be glad you did. To live with pain daily is no fun.|Dr. Chai is a wonderful positive person. He listens to your problem than he goes after what the actual problem may be. He did that with me . My rt lower lumbar always hurts and causes problems with my rt leg..I have a problem with my Sacroiliac as well as my fusion and Dr. Chai replaced my old stimulator with his unit. Just a few weeks ago. Did great job. This one is different from my last one. Going through testing and maybe a retune at my next follow up.So, far it is doing the job.Considering my circumstances. If you have pain. Talk to Dr. Chai. He knows what he is doing as well as his staff. Great people. Recommend Summit Spine out of Carrollton, GA
Veterans talk to your VA doctor to out source Community Care Services. Close to your homes. I'm a Veteran.|Overall, I felt like I received very great care from Summit. Staff were always pleasant. Providers seemed caring. I felt like my pain was being adequately managed. I don't want to badmouth them, but I have some deep concerns about how my end care was managed. It is very hard to be a person who needs pain management. It feels like it's not ok for patients to ask questions because we're treated like criminals.

Is there a safe process for patients (or former patients) to reach out regarding concerns? I don't know how else to get questions answered and was hoping somebody from management might see this post.|I have been going to see Dr Chai for over a year now and he has listened and helped me with my chronic pain. Not only is he a great doctor but he truly cares about his patients. Lastly, he has the absolute best bedside manner and makes you feel comfortable.|I really feel summit is the right place to treat my pain and keep it under control .I've been under pain management since 2008 .I went to another pain clinic from 2008 till 2024 nearly 16 years,I even continued going to them after I moved here in 2020 two and half hours away.till 2024 of september.i had good Drs but the staff was so bad the last few years .I have to say I'm happy with summit I made a good choice it's hard changing Drs after that many years.i love my Drs I had.but Dr chai, just the six months I been going he's such a pleasant person to talk to he friendly and makes you feel like he really does care ,puts you at ease to talk to.explains everything he's going to do and why.and while he was doing my shots he's having  conversation with me. He's just very nice and professional  but  caring. I have never had a doctor that just made you feel like all his patients are really important to him.he told me if I need help when I go back to work,if i need a letter saying I can't stand for just a certain amount of time.  this is so different from a lot of Drs, I've never had the last Drs I seen all those years I went,ever offer to help me out in such a caring and compassion way, as Dr chai, as he show me he cares if I'm ok while I'm working if I need too again.i really like the staff,that matters a lot to me. due to the last 16 years of the front desk of my last drs office their staff had no compassion. every six months they would be some new staff up front and they didn't know how to treat people who was in pain.they didn't need to be in that kind of career at all  and I told them a few times just how I felt about the treatment and they needed to find a different kind of career because they have chosen the wrong one.i felt like they was only there to receive their paycheck.id be in tears and angry sometimes by the time I saw the Dr. Cant say that  about the Drs. there great and very good Doctors which is why I went to them for so many years and put up with the staff.but I'm happy to be going  now to summit spine and pain Doctor now in Carrollton, probably will continue as long as the doors are open.I have no complaints of staff are the Drs here.they have been great so far. I never waited more than 20 minutes in the lobby and once I'm in the back I am seeing the Doctor within 15 mins.these doctors here impressed me how they are willing to adjust your medication as needed. and also with any other treatments. they are kind enough to answer any questions you may have for them.i feel I'm in good hands now.|I am currently being treated for spinal issues and chronic pain.
Dr Gerald Chai is  always very caring and kind.
He is a wonderful doctor with high energy, enthusiasm, and humility.
I will continue to refer him to everyone I know, and Summit is blessed to have his expertise and high level of professional etiquette on board.

They contacted me almost immediately and got me into the office in less than two weeks (I actually think it was a week but I'm not positive). The new patient appt person was lovely on the phone.

I was shocked at my first appointment though.  The office reception area was PACKED and a huge line to check in.  I waited an hour to see Dr Strother but she was great.  The med assistant that took me back was extremely friendly

My thoughts are that the Columbus office isn't as nice as Lagrange. I'm going to do all my appointments there. I've had a couple procedures and Dr Strother never seems to rush or ignore me.  She listens and we work on the most painful issues.  I highly recommend her

I would say though the Columbus office needs help with time management and to thoroughly clean that office especially the front office. It just smells dirty and looks messy

Overall I'm pretty happy going to Lagrange|I havnt been a patient here in two years. But when I was, I set aside the whole afternoon because I would be in the waiting area for 2-3 hours. The reason I'm back however, is that two years ago they tried to bill me repeatedly for an operation that the Dr confirmed with me multiple times was covered by tricare. After I was billed he confirmed again and said you have nothing to worry about. Here I am two years later receiving yet again ... another bill for something I am not suppose to pay for. Two years. At this point it's going to collections. I do not care. I feel sorry for anyone who's forced to go here through tricare.

Also have been trying to get ahold of anyone the past few few days. No response from leaving a voicemail or the patient portal I was told to use.|I have been a patient since 2016 at Nexus Pain Care Center Columbus GA. It has really deteriorated over the past year and a half. This correspondences with the expansion of the company to 3 other locations. Just an example, today my appointment was at 11:30 AM. It's currently 1:15 PM and I am still in the waiting room. The staff can't even tell me how much longer I have to wait to be seen. This is totally unexcepable.|I met with Dr. Casiano today. Not only is he caring, but also takes the time to listen and get to the root of the problem. I very much recommend him! Thanks for fast, great service!|They used to treat me and all of my friends with super great efficiency and proficiency. Jennifer was like the first sergeant at the front desk running everything smoothly if you had a problem you could contact her and she'd get it fixed immediately. I don't know if she's on vacation but she hasn't been here in a couple weeks and the place has totally fallen apart. They need to keep her here all the time because she knows all of the Patients and they all love her. If she's not back soon myself and all of my friends are going to start looking for another pain center because she's the glue that holds this place together.|Saying I haven't taking a drug test sense April but have charged me for them. Denying my medication cause they too lazy to print a hard copy have been waiting in the lobby an hr after my appointment and to threaten to show out to get them to do anything.

And I had high hopes for her and he upcoming appointments. She was told she would feel better and gain a quality of life she once had. Instead she's had nothing but trouble. Unprofessional staff. Not just to my mother but also to other patients in the waiting room and checking in... It's their way or the highway. I've seen all the responses to the reviews ""thank you for your response"" but hopefully the one star will help bring the rating down for future patients can be aware.|I'm very thankful that I'm a patient here.

Thank you Dr.B you are awesome.|I'm VERY grateful for him and his staff
I've been going to them for over 2 years. They are some of the nicest people.  They are always there when I call and need them. They stay in the solution and I appreciate that... again wonderful staff.|Worse office staff EVER!!! They don't answer or return your calls, suck at procedure scheduling, always billing incorrectly, and the list goes on. RUN FAR AWAY from this office!!! I'm a new patient here and don't plan to return.|I had no problems for almost two years. I didn't as for special favors. I went in and saw the nurse practitioner and got my prescription. She kept asking bout the neck injections and I kept refusing and for some reason that day she was in a mood! Very Vindictive nurse practitioner! I refused to get steroid injections in my neck and she started typing! Before I left that day, my pain management had been discontinued without warning after two years  and I had been locked out and informed by the nurse! The nurse practitioner didn't even have the guts to tell me in person! She locked me out like a dog and sent someone else to do her dirty work! Steroid injections don't work for everyone, including me! And I most certainly don't want anybody messing around my neck! I've informed her of this at every appointment! Maybe I should have informed her of how they didn't wear gloves when I had my shoulder injectioned, not even when they took blood! They fumbled around the spot as if they didn't know what they were doing during the injection and I just can't have that level of incompetence when dealing with my NECK! As a medical professional, I was taught to do no harm! What were they taught? My way or the highway! O yea, hardly any of the staff wears a mask! Also I wasn't given any guidance after being on pain management for two years! I think that's a dangerous practice to drop a patient with no warning!|I highly recommend Dr. B.  He and his office staff have been helpful and nice  over and above what is expected.  He successfully relieved my 76 year old Mom's back and hip pain that no other Dr. could do. He and his staff made sure we understood what they were doing and allowed us all the time we needed to ask questions.  We cannot say enough about how wonderful we were treated from the time we arrived to the time we left and the days after.  They have been intouch to ask how she is doing and if we needed anything.  We visited several other Dr.'s for this same pain and no one could help her.  Thank you Dr. B. and all of your staff.|I had an outpatient procedure done on September 2, 2021. I was scheduled for a follow up for next week. I was given in writing that date and time of the appointment. I arrive 15 minutes early for the appointment on the scheduled day. I was placed into a exam room and left for an hour. Since I had a prior engagement scheduled,  I ended up leaving because I could no longer wait. My appointment was very changed in the system from two until the hour I waited already. So I rescheduled the appointment for a couple days later. I arrived at the appointment only to find that the usual front office clerk was not sitting at her desk and was helped by another member who is not the nicest person I've ever spoken to. I was charged a co-pay for a follow up appointment.   I sat in the waiting room and after 30 minute wait I was told that my appointment has been canceled and a message had been left the previous day on my answering machine. I looked at my voicemail and I never received a cancellation phone call. I was told that I do not need a follow up appointment although I did have a very tedious procedure and have not spoken to the doctor since.  It's this kind of retaliation from the staff members that could cost a person their health.|I recommended  Dr White to my sister when she moved down here. If he took the time to talk to her he might have know what was going on with her. But she had different intake Assistants and apparently when ordering procedures they don't know the correct wording. They were rude and dismissive. They pretty much left my 75 year old sister in pain. Thought they say they are trying I just didn't see it. She has been in pain for 2 mnths now and barely able to get out of bed. They took their sweet time getting her first surgery scheduled and thats where the damage was done. finally did the second after we had reminded them(they said they had no idea lie) it.didn't take. Their wording to the insurance for a procedure she didn't need was wrong and denied.

I found all staff members to be pleasant and helpful. Dr. Seratto is a straightforward to the point kind of man. I liked that, not mincing words or wasting time with likely scenarios. Very knowledgeable doctor. He answered all my questions and explained everything in layman's terms. His diagnosis and treatment plan have given me the much needed pain relief I have desperately needed, as well as the most restful and pain free nights in months. So grateful I was referred to him.|Went there till I got out of the service in 2013. Just got a referral to go back for a bulging disk and nerve blocks for neck . All they wanted to know is why I quit going in 2013 . Like it hurt their feelings.  Did not ask for pain meds was told several times they wasn't give me any . Did not want them . All Dr sotto did was ask why I left in 2013 , and what do I want him to do . Long story short he finally decided to order a procedure on my back never heard back from them . Hopefully I can find another Dr . Want be back to him . Obviously he has to much buisness handing out prescription.|I have no problem with Dr Serrato. Yeah he could work on his bedside manner, but I just spoke over him for the first minute of the visit until he was finished reading my chart, he listened to me and offered more than one solution. He is very straight forward, I like that. The only people that have issues with him are usually patients that don't follow the strict guidelines of pain management..|My 87 year old mom went there and after a 40 minute wait seen the doctor and was told he would call her prescription into her pharmacy, he did not. I have called 3times this past week and was told someone would call me back, they didn't. MO day it will be a week she has been in tears cause we can't get her meds
And this isn't the 1st time this has happened|You have to deal with totally random incompetent people! It take 1-2 hours after your appointment for the prescription nurse to send it to your pharmacy! They really need to look at they treat the older patients!!!!|Great location and very caring head nurse. Head nurse goes beyond the call of duty. Awesome customer service. Mask not required but suggested. No three or four hour wait to see the Dr. Appointment are required and patients are seen accordingly.|I have never had any issues with the staff, in fact I find them pleasant. Sure the Dr maybe straight forward, but who doesn't want a doctor to be honest and straight forward with you as a patient, if I have questions, he answers them fully and I'm completely satisfied with that.|Do not waste your time with this ""1 man show"". Dr. Serrato is very rude as well as majority of his staff, especially the white women at the front desk. When you're in pain and suffer from severe anxiety and depression, he will DEFINITELY Escalate your trauma. Extremely poor bedside manners, he doesn't show that he care about you as a person to help you get better. This is only a means to pay his expenses. You will be just another number, especially if you start asking questions about your treatment plan. He goes in between patients within 5 to 10 minutes. I had one epidural cervical I needed a valium prior to treatment,  his staff gave me the med 15 minutes prior to the procedure. I was severely nervous and starting crying because the pain of the needle was tremendous! Dr. Serrato started belittling me and said he'd never in 20 years had a patient cry before. Following procedure, no one called or scheduled a follow up. I couldn't walk for up to 10hrs afterwards due to excruciating pain in arms and legs.

I called to reschedule my appointment with Dr. Singleton three days before my appointment and, they told me i couldn't because the office was closing. I had to scramble to find a new pain doctor.
Not only did they not contact me to let me know this was happening but they also, didn't help me find a new doctor. I could sue for malpractice and negligence. You can't just stop the medicines he prescribed cold turkey, without titrating down because of the high dosages. It can cause death if not handled properly.

I am very angry at how Doctor Smith and Doctor Singleton have handled my case and driven this once great pain clinic into the ground. Doctor Sheehan and Doctor Rollins were the greatest doctors and it's so sad how the owners of the practice made them leave and left us with the other horrible doctors.|UPDATE....
The person who responded to my review said to please call or email them for further details. I emailed them and they have NEVER responded to me. Just an FYI.

I had been seeing Dr. Rollins for the past 8 years or so and he was amazing. I started seeing Dr. Smith about a year ago and it has been hell. Without even talking to me and seeing how my current meds and treatments were working she immediately started force tapering me. I am a very compliant patient. Never missed an appointment and never failed a drug test. About a month or so ago I was at my ropes end with my pain so at my last appointment I asked her if she was going to take all of my oral meds and she said YES. That would leave me with only my pain pump. It barely touched my pain. She also told me at my first 3 appointments that she just needed to bring my meds down a bit to show compliance with the DEA she said if it was too much she'd put me back on my regular dose. Needless to say she did not. She's a liar! She is hands down the worst doctor I've ever seen. A pain management doctor who doesn't actually treat pain. Stay away from this doctor.|Dr. Stephanie Smith is absolutely AWESOME!  Former doctor was pleasant, but was not managing pain well - which is not good for a ""specialist"".  Dr. Smith introduced options that I had no idea were possible - even experiencing immediate pain relief.  Her care and attention to detail are phenomenal.  Oh and the new option to send narcotic prescriptions directly to the pharmacy?  What!!!!  This was possible?  Nice to see the office get some hi-tech upgrades.  Never understood why the old office was fiddling with paper. 1 star missing from this review because the office staff are unable to keep up with the load - get them some help if possible.|My husband had been seeing Dr. Rollins for many years, than started care with Dr. Smith. I wasn't sure at first but honestly she has given the very best care in all 10 years of our Worker's Comp injury nightmare. She is the 1st & only Dr to take his many issues head on, seek to get answers and best laid plan of action. I truly thank her from the bottom of my !!! The staff have always been pleasant, not always easy to get communication through...but it does get addressed. They have a large amount of patients, hence sometimes a delay in communication.  THANK YOU, DR. STEPHANIE SMITH for trying to give my husband back some of his life. I'm forever grateful!!!|I went a couple of weeks ago, and it was a long wait. That's because 1 provider was seeing pts that 3 providers used to see. I rescheduled, because I had some other things to take care of that day. I went back yesterday, saw the Dr, and was very impressed with her care and concern for me. She spent the needed time with me, to refill my pump, and discuss my medications and make sure they were working for me. I was really impressed with Dr Smith. I think she spent the necessary time needed with me, and probably every pt. Thank you!|I have been a patient with SIPA since '16 when a doctor there consulted on one of my legal proceedings.
Much like everyone else I was shocked when the previous doctors and NP were gone overnight and replaced with Dr Smith.

Whom I have never seen. She repeatedly canceled and pushed back my appointment and each time I asked if she would still be able to submit my meds. I was anxious to be seen and figure out why the drastic cuts to medication to a patient she had never laid eyes on and who told me she couldn't find extensive records on me.

This past month they went on vacation for a week, refused to fill my prescription till they see me and pushed my appointment out another 6 days. After trying to contact them over a dozen times (documented), two trips to the ER, (I have new cervical damage due to suddenly coming off my medication.) I was told they would prescribe me something to help with discontinuation syndrome. Which they haven't yet.

I take care of a terminal cancer patient, my ex-husband, and our my daughter who has the same genetic condition that led to his cancer. Needless to say we have spent a lot of time in the medical system and this is far and away the most jaw dropping treatment I have ever seen. I mean who pushes out appointments for life or death treatment and then uses not seeing a patient as an excuse for discontinuing treatment?

Edit - 09/22/22 - I have now been diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy. Between the sneezing and vomiting I have had two discs herniated. Meanwhile a prescription for a drug that is no longer available and would be dangerous for me to take was called into a pharmacy. One that has nothing to do with what I am experiencing. The pharmacist thought it must of been a mistake. So far I haven't been contacted.|Dr Smith is very nice and the office staff is as well. I've been going to this office for 12 years and I have always had a great service and care. I have recently noticed there is a longer wait time but that's due to Dr Smith being the only doctor at this time. I do have confidence that things will work out soon and she'll have some help. If your considering this office I give it a go. They really are good and will work a plan to help you in feeling better.|I was a former patient here, seen by Dr. Rollins.  When the 3 health care providers were FORCED OUT ,I had no choice but to see Dr. Smith.  It was the most unprofessional visit of my life.  She scheduled me during her LUNCH!  Then she criticized prior Doctor's to me.  I was given Dr. Sheahans phone number by one of the patients in the waiting room.  Thank you God, I was able to get back with him ....a REAL doctor!",2023-12-28|2023-06-15|2022-07-28|2023-05-07|2022-06-15|2022-09-16|2022-09-14|2022-10-17,1|1|4|5|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","WHERE IS DR.

As for medication, if you're only looking for quick access to Schedule II medications, please look elsewhere.  Dr Newton is a consummate professional with a focus on pain relief for back issues, and Sch II requires patient doctor history, trust, diagnosis, etc. For chronic pain that only responds to Sch II, a contract including random urinalysis, pill checks, etc. is required.

Follow up appointments with her are very worthwhile.  They are well timed around my treatments.|Ms. Torre Is the first person in more than 30 years of suffering that has listened to me explain where a certain pain is coming from. People have insisted to me that this is my low back or lumbar region.
Ms Torre took the time to let me explain my issue and join me in examining a spinal chart on the wall. Don't forget, these are in almost every room in every pain management doctors office.
No one has ever been willing to take the time and be patient enough to listen to me until now. It is not my lumbar or low back. It is my middle back,  thoracic region. And now a new MRI is ordered and I will be getting treatment for the pain that has been making me ill for many years.
I don't suppose any of the previous practitioners would want to give me back any of my time or money even if they could. They've been treating a low back problem. While I don't have a great low back, this extreme pain has been in my middle back the whole time.

My general doctors office said they required an npi number to complete the referral. So, I called and asked for it. The lady that answered the phone was so rude to me and said no one needs that number and I don't really feel comfortable giving it to you. She questioned me as if I were a criminal. I told her I was doing what my doctor office asked. She refused and was very mean about it. Needless to say I'm going somewhere else. I don't have the energy for dealing with this.
I called them back and explained to them this is what the doctor said. The office personnel to me to google it! So I can google it but she can't just give me the information I need? This place is a joke and obviously could care less about anyone in pain.|I've had excellent care from Dr. Morrison and his staff over many years. He takes the time to hear my situation and finds a way to help. Dr. Morrison has taken better care of my overall health issues more than some of my other physicians. He is not just a doctor that gives you a script and runs in the room and out quickly. He takes the time you need and listens.  I HIGHLY recommend him and I am blessed to have him as my doctor watching over my overall health and care.|Made my first appointment with office for which I waited a week for scheduled date - severe nerve pain  - can barely walk.  I missed my first appointment  -  by hours - and called when I realized I had conflicting info.  I was told by a less than kind office personnel, that Doctor Morrison would no longer take me as a patient since I missed my appointment.  I explained to the office personal that possibly, just possibly, there was an error in communication which they steadfastly stated that could not happen.  I advised them that I have paperwork that clearly shows some poorly communicated information.  At this point, I knew any doctor that would refuse a patient in pain that had waited a week for that appointment was not doctor I would want to care for me...but I did want him to see the information I had that clearly shows - yes indeed we all make mistakes.  I was told by his office to submit my info thru the patient portal.  I did .  A few hours later I checked the portal to see if there was any sort of acknowledgement and found they had already disabled my account - so who knows if this doctor even saw my email.  I called back and spoke with another office personal who told me that once the doctor decides to not see you he will not read any of my information.   The conversation when downhill from there.  In a nutshell - this doctor should possibly reconsider his field of profession.  So disappointed in his callous handling of a person in pain.  Shame on him and 'his' policy.|I love this office all around. They are well versed in the paperwork needed for insurance. They have always treated me kindly. Dr. Straus has always listened to my needs as they have changed throughout the years. He has never pushed me into taking something I was not comfortable taking. He is kind and only prescribes the amounts needed to keep my pain controlled.
I believe in him, His staff and the circumstances under which they work. .|There was Miscommunication with signing the release form as i was moving from one clinic to this clinic because of travel convenience. The office manager immediately accused me of pill seeking! I explain my situation and then she proceeded to say that I couldn't attend 2 clinics at once! Duh! Maybe if she shut her mouth and listened she would have understood my concerns and may have gotten a new patient! I will drive the 30 minutes for some divinity and respect!!!!!!-|I almost died from this place.  They kept me on tramadol and I'm bedridden in pain . Then I accidently somehow got Medicaid even though I never applied and they dropped me like a fly and I was on benzos.  Ended up in the e.r for weeks . We called to tell them this one staff said she would talk to the e.r doctor about my situation and what I'm on then when we called back when the doctor was in the room she said I never said that . I will not speak to him!!!!! The doctor even believed me that she did that.  He said pain clinics are awful and kill ppl and I almost did die from this place .   I literally almost died.  The staff was so rude to my boyfriend who takes care of me . When we called the last time and asked if I get off Medicaid can i get another appt they said . We might not even take you back if we don't want to. Really mean how they said it to and I have never failed a drug test . did as they said.  was very sweet to them. My medicine we kept in a locked safe counted them every single day so I would never mess up . Oh and we had to call all the time cause they would mess up on how many to give me in the bottle had the times messed up and everything and we called and told them of the day we got the medicine and they said it was our fault .  Had proof of my problems . Idk why they were so mean to me . Almost like they didn't want to deal with such a severe case.  I have a new doctor now.  And I'm on straight morphine and I'm bedridden for life.  My new doctors cares for me and the first day I came crawling in her office she said why in the world do they have you on tramadol . Every disc in my back is herniated so severe there is no help with even surgery.  Also they erased all the bad reviews from this site the day I almost died.  So they will erase this one . They will remember me I know it.  I hate to write a bad review.  And it took me a long time to put it cause I was so nice to you guys . Really wanted doctor Strauss  To help me to believe me . But No . No . Yall didn't care at all . And it saddens me all the ppl I saw in the waiting room was fine while I was screaming in pain . And you guys didn't want to have to deal with it . Point blank . That's why yall wouldn't take me back . Oh well I'm better off now with a doctor who found my real problems . And put me on the medicine I needed to be able to even take a shower.|Only in my second visit but they have a highly efficient process your not there hours wasting a whole day sitting in a waiting room. All the staff is very pleasant  doctor is absolutely spot on and easy to talk to and answers questions  that are easy to understand. Hope to stay a patient as long as possible.|Dr. Straus is amazing . He is thorough and friendly . However , the answering service is extremely rude , unfriendly , not helpful , and bad attitude each time I've called in . Which is why they get 4 star . Really need better people with customer service experience and patience answering phone calls .

On my first appointment, Dr. Ju spent over an hour with me listening to all my concerns and reviewing my medical records from previous appointments with other doctors.  After his review, he generated a plan of action to help reduce my pain with a goal of elimination.  He was very sure that he could help assist me, where previous doctors had failed.

Throughout the process Dr. Ju was attentive, empathetic, and took his time to ensure I was heard.  He listened as if I was his only patient and he had all the time in the world to spend with me.

My pain has begun to subside and I feel that I am on my way back to living my life without pain.  I would highly recommend Dr. Ju and his office staff to anyone who is living with chronic pain.|Dr. Ju is an amazing doctor. He will not stop until he figures out the cause of your pain. I came to him a year ago and this journey has been difficult, but he's been amazing, kind, compassionate and patient. I've seen other doctors on this journey, and I trust Dr. Ju the most. He's professional but can be super casual as well, which you don't get much, and it's refreshing. It's good to laugh during these times when you're starting to feel hopeless. The staff at Dr. Ju's office are amazing as well. They are kind and caring every time I see them or call. I'd recommend him to anyone. I'm so glad he was put in my path and that he's on this adventure with me.|Dr. K and his team exemplify a rare breed of genuine, good medicine - and if the Align team could take care of every specialty of medicine I needed, I'd be in the best hands possible in this state.

But as my body began to fail and my medical team began to abandon me, Dr. K and the Align Spine team safeguarded me and stood by my side, taking care of any of my needs- questions, pain, and beyond - as they came.

They deserve a testimony that goes beyond what I can write right now. But do know that you'll feel welcomed and helped to the best extent possible by Align.|Dr. Ju is the best and most comprehensive pain management practitioner I have ever seen. He truly has your best interest at heart and cares on a level that is reassuring and kind. I trust him and his office with my multiple injuries. He also has great contacts and has referred me to other great doctors who take great care of me and often in tandem with Dr. Ju. I would reference all my friends and family to him. His entire office staff are kind and efficient. They all do above and beyond for their patients. I cannot recommend him more.|Dr. K understands back pain is real and treats the patient. He listens and spends time explaining your options. No lower back pain this week. I'd forgotten what it feels like not to hurt!|Dr. Tom Ju did a stellar job managing my husband's pain from a C6-7 herniated disc. He's knowledgeable, warm, personable and a  pleasure to talk to. He takes his time with each visit and explains his treatment plans and thoughts very thoroughly. Whenever we had questions/concerns after hours, he returned calls pretty promptly and addressed those questions/concerns in full. Heck, he even called us on a Sunday evening to address an insurance situation! Additionally, he recommended a neurosurgeon for a surgical intervention to this debilitating injury. Dr. Ju definitely understands the assignment! 10 out of 10. Would highly recommend for pain management!|Tired of daily pain keeping you from doing what you love? Are you tired of the same old routine treatment from orthopedists? You've gotta try Dr. Ju at Align Spine for Pain Management. Can't believe there exists a specialist (Anesthesiologist) willing to outline every pain  issue you need help with, outline possible treatment plans with timelines and costs, flexible scheduling, friendliest staff, regenerative therapy (PRP) for arthritic joints, nerve ablation, lidocaine patch strips for painful hand joints, etc.,that makes sure you understand and actually listens to you and truly helps relieve pain without pills. I love that he lets you use nitrous oxide while giving x-ray guided injections of H.A. or PRP EXACTLY where it's needed to relieve pain.
I recently underwent the trial use of a NEVRO Spinal Cord Stimulator device, while under mild I.V. sedation. I was told to expect 60% reduction of pain from herniated disc and longstanding sciatica. I'd had a laminectomy last year that gave me only 8 weeks of pain relief, then returned same as before - unable to sit, stand, walk, lie down, or LIVE, without tight, nagging pain down back of both of my legs. Plus, it took me 3 months to heal and be off work! Within a couple of hours of turning on the device, I could not believe the pain signal was blocked 99% for those 3 days! I did everything that previously induced pain, (except I wasn't allowed to bend over), and I felt NOTHNG! The 1% came on the 3rd day when I got into a low seated car. All I had to do was get out the remote control and increase the high frequency setting from 4 to 5,  and the pain was blocked! I didn't even take my usual meds at bedtime and slept fine and woke up without my typical pain and stiffness! Unbelievable! Next step is to get in with a surgeon to implant the device under my skin for the next 10 years and move on with retirement!|I came to Align spin from a referral through my primary doctor and let's just say it has been  one of the best decisions of my life : for many years I've seen so many doctors with the same issue and within 2 appointments My doctor at Align has figured out more than 5 doctors combined. Not only does he take his time with each patient but during that time he is explaining things , educating you and listening to any concerns you might have. He actually cares about your quality of life and how what you are seeing him for is being treated. I can't recommend him enough.

The front desk staff are friendly, professional and helpful. Medical Assistant's are very thorough, take time to actually talk with you and are always noting what you say. The Nurse Practitioner and Doctors are always willing to find ways to elevate pain and discomfort. They listen and don't make you feel rushed. I switched from another pain management office and I am so grateful that I found Ace Pain and Spine!! Thank you Ace Pain and Spine for all you do!|If you're looking for a pain clinic that helps with just about all sorts of pain, I believe this is the perfect place! They do same day injections, they work well with so many insurances, and they have a wonderful staff. They have staff that can TRANSLATE VIETNAMESE and SPANISH!! I've changed my insurance throughout the years and they were so understanding. If I needed to reschedule due a vacation, they were willing to work with me as long as I let them know three days ahead of time. When I took my father in, they diagnosed him and caught all of his symptoms! I didn't even know he had some of them, but they had a plan for us every step of the way. Highly recommend|Very professional very nice people ordinarily it is a great place. But I will be honest the post operative care is awful. I have been lied to about many things. I recommend them under normal circumstances but definitely let someone else take care of your post op.|Staff member Ashley who answered the phone for me is THE GREATEST help I think I've ever received from a doctors office.  She really cares for her patients seems like and doesn't just do like most people do and say she will do this and that and doesn't.  Again seems like she genuinely cares for her patients that call in and need help and follows up to make sure they get that help.  Everyone here is so nice and friendly, including Ashley of course, and she is the reason my family continues going to Ace Pain & Spine.  Thank you so much Ashley.|Ngoc is the MA and she was so sweet. She answered all of my questions and concerns. Thomas the nurse practitioner did a very good job explaining everything. Went out of his way to make sure the treatment regime did not hinder my daily life. I appreciate the team!|I recently visited ACE Pain and Spine Clinic, and I was blown away by the level of care and professionalism I received. From the moment I walked in, the staff was super friendly and helpful, making sure I felt comfortable and informed throughout my visit. The clinic's atmosphere was super calming and organized, which really helped me relax and get my mind at ease. The medical team was super knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything in a way that I could understand. This made me feel really confident in the care I was getting.

Dr. Truong and the team really cared about my well-being, and they made sure I got personalized treatment plans that were just right for me. They're experts in pain management and spine health, and I could definitely see a difference in my symptoms after they started treating me. The follow-up care has been amazing, with the staff making sure I'm on track and answering any questions or concerns I have right away. It's clear that patient satisfaction and health outcomes are a top priority at this clinic. Overall, my experience at the Pain and Spine Clinic was nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs pain management or spine care. The dedication and skill of the entire team have made a huge difference in my life. I can't say enough good things about this clinic!|Punctual with appointment time, clean facility, and everyone we met on staff was very nice and professional. Especially the medical assistant Brian, who was knowledgeable-answering every question we asked, and showed genuine concern.Having a procedure done next month (would have been nice to meet the doctor who is performing it but maybe he wasn't there that day, idk) but otherwise it was a really nice first appointment.|This clinic is extremely great at what they do and make you feel extremely at ease.

I moved to Georgia over 2 years ago when I first started recovery. I knew I couldn't do it alone and needed professional help so I Googled addiction doctors and his name was at the very top so I called. The doctor himself answered the phone (amazing), he was very kind and worked with me to schedule an appointment that best fit my schedule. I went to my first appointment a few days later and have been seeing him every month since. He treats me like a human being, he doesn't use words I don't understand and if he does he fully explains it to me, and he doesn't treat me like the addict I once was. He is a pain management doctor but he also treats addiction, was an anesthesiologist, and he is very educated in what he does in all aspects. He is a no nonsense type of doctor which is a good thing and he also listens to his patients instead of talking over them. I'd recommend him to anyone for addiction and/or pain management! Anyone that says otherwise has never actually been treated by him.|Dr. Theofilis is a very smart physician that really knows his stuff. I had been in pain for a month and it was increasing very rapidly to the point where I could barely walk. I had been on several medications that were not doing any good. He met me after hours,  and after a thorough exam, diagnosed exactly what was going on (which was later confirmed by MRI). He was 100% correct when he told me that any treatment that he would do would not be long term and that I needed to see a neurosurgeon for surgery. A few weeks later, after having the surgery, I'm pain free, exercising and even lifting weights again. Thank you Dr. Theofilis!!!|I have been working with Dr Theofilis over the past 2 plus years after becoming injured.  His knowledge and skill level along with his passion to help others who TRULY want help are amazing.  He is brash, no doubt, but he is doing this in ways to protect you as the patient.  His office and staff are in no way a pill mill..  They have been fantastic!  And I attest, I am a very hard patient to deal with....  Thanks Dr T and staff for helping give me a life after my injury!|I've been seeing Dr.T for 2 years now and he's the best thing that ever happened to me. He is so kind and so knowledgeable about my condition. Not only is he my doctor, but I truly feel like he's my friend. I have so much respect for this man and his care and concern for us. Not just from a medical stand point, but from a personal perspective. He is one of a kind and will get you feeling better immediately! Thanks for everything Dr.T!!|How can I even begin to describe in words what this doctor means to my family. Let me start off by saying after 20+ surgeries, 7 gyenecologic, gynecologic oncologists and endometriosis  specialists, I was finally referred to Dr. Theofilis. I went into this appointment like I did the many many other appointments I had with the other specialists, I'm going to go in here, they are going to go through all of my records and finally tell me ""there's nothing we can do to help you!"" Little did I know this day would be the day that changed my life forever! Dr. Theofilis already had all of my records and had went through every single one of them! When I walked in he started with a very thorough head to toe assessment. Then we sat down and I waited for those words I often heard, instead he not only knew what was going on with all of my vaginal prolapses, but he also picked up on why I was having excruciating pain in my abdomen and my low back!! He has done everything, and I mean everything to get me back to living a normal, pain-free life. I have went from living on a coach daily not able to even walk to the bathroom, to holding a full time job, never missing a day of work, able to keep up with my 10 and 12 year old kids and all of their many sporting events, to traveling the world with my family and not being fearful of the long car rides because of the pain. Dr. Theofilis cares deeply for his patients, goes above and beyond to take care of his patients, advocates for his patients. He is stern but it is to keep you safe and on the right road to recovery. I've even known him to come in on his off days just to be there for one of his patients. Dr. Theofilis is not your typical doctor, he truly is the best there is!! He considers us his family, not his patients. I thank my God daily for putting Dr. Theofilis and his family in my life because he truly has given me mine back!!|Dr. Theofilis completely changed my life. For the last 7 years, I was bounced back and forth between gynecologists and pain managements. I was suffering from debilitating pelvic and back pain, and was being offered no real answers or treatment. From my first visit at Arilex Medical, I knew this would be different. Dr. Theofilis explained my conditions in great detail. I cannot explain the feeling of hearing this wonderful man say that he understood my pain, and how it must be affecting my life! Since becoming his patient, my pain has been reduced and I'm starting to be able to enjoy my daughters and my life again! The sweet ladies in the office are incredible and always make me feel welcome. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all you do! You're such a blessing to me.|I have suffered, as many of you have, incredible back and hip pain. Trying to get out of bed, doing daily activities and just trying to make in from day-to-day is very challenging and disheartening to say the least. I'm not saying that I haven't been seen by good physicians in the past, but Dr.Theofilis stands head-and-shouders from anyone that I have ever experienced. He will sit down and explain to his patients, in an elementary but not demeaning manner, what he recommends. He makes the complex look easy.I am most grateful for his work. I would be remiss if I did not mention his phenomenal staff. They're very professional and will do everything in their power to work with you as a patient.|Dr. T has been so helpful trying to help me manage my abdominal/pelvic, back and leg nerve pain.  I feel like I'm a complicated case having had 5 surgeries in and through my abdomen, and he has always believed he can improve my situation.  It's a process, but I can say it is working!  He always explains the mechanisms and research behind different drugs and treatments.  I'm looking forward to continued improvement and getting my life back!",2020-03-05|2019-03-07|2018-11-25|2019-08-07|2019-04-12|2019-09-04|2019-02-06|2019-05-29,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Identifies as veteran-owned, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|efficient_service|thorough_care|medication_management|injection_treatments|advanced_treatment_options|on_site_pharmacy|multilingual_staff_available|comfortable_waiting_area|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ547vdnRiX4gRSJnkyqdeqZs,33

His is very thorough and knowledgeable and seems to really want to resolve the issue conservatively, without jumping immediately to resolution through medication.  I've been seeing him for years now and trust his judgement and professionalism.|Receptionists and nurse were very kind and listened, and were accommodating of me and my service dog. However the doctor I spoke to was very dismissive. While my father was in the room he said that they were unable to treat my specific pain and would refer me to Emory. However when my father left the room to take my service dog to the bathroom the doctor suddenly changed his mind and told me I needed to see a psychiatrist. I've dealt with chronic pain and disability for most of my life, and doctors dismissing me is unfortunately nothing new to me. I found the act of only changing his tune when my father left the room  with my service dog particularly insulting, as if he was waiting for there to be nobody to stick up for me. I'm sure if you're older this is the place for you, but anyone under the age of 40 should probably avoid.|Dr. Gupta truly cares about any problems you're having and strives to get them resolved. She's very caring and concerned with your well being. The team reaches out to check on you after your procedure. I would recommend her to anyone experiencing any back or spinal pains.|I would like to thank everyone on the team including the staff upfront. Thy are always caring but most importantly I will like to thank William because he is very interested in helping me figure out this diagnosis. He's open to what I have to say and advocates for my well being. Although I'm not where i want to be, I'm hopeful due to the way they treat me.|I have been a patient of Dr. Palavi Gupta for many years now. If you are in severe back pain, in my opinion she is indeed ""The Best Pain Doctor"" you can find. I was referred to this Practice by my Rheumatologist. The  medicines she prescribed, didn't help me manage the Chronic Pains, from my Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I wasn't going to get the regular back surgery done. I was determined that no Doctor would cut open my back. So, I was happy to receive mon-invasive Surgeries to enable me to stand up straight, and  walk.  I normally would see her at the Austell location. But, when I  requested a meeting with her, concerning a new upcoming procedure, she was in her Dallas office,  on Friday.  I found out it was so much closer to my residence. It only took me 13 minutes to arrive.  The staff was so friendly, and smiled  a lot. I fell in love with Deneen, she is Dr. Gupta's PA, at that location.  Now, both locations are very clean, and you will be treated well. But now, I will be switching most definitely, to Alliance Pain and Spine, at their Dallas, GA  location.
She is the reason that I am able to still drive my car  and move around so much better, now. Please give her office,  a chance to give you a better quality of life. You will be so happy  like me.|I love this clinic !
I see Brandon and I always make my appointments with him.
He is always kind and caring and listens to you.
The girls that run this office are always helpful and friendly.
Dr. Gupta is awesome!!
I like her very much. She is always on point and very sweet.|Dr E is a wonderful doctor. He is very knowledgeable and takes the time to examine , explain what is going on, next steps and what to expect. In Addition his nursing staff are so kind, even will take the time to visit with you to make you comfortable.  Finally the office staff are incredibly pleasant as well.  I am very grateful I was referred to him, I feel I have found a physician that can make a difference with the medical condition I am fighting.|Never met this doctor before, but she is one of the top docs. I was very pleased with her approach with her knowledge and with her touch she was very, very very I would recommend anyone that has any back injections. You will not be disappointed.

They are always friendly and smiling and make you feel welcome! Facility is clean and nice. Doctor is very thorough and spends time with you. I have never had to wait very long for my appointment (thankfully). They are a legitimate clinic that runs 'by the book'
and I am grateful to have found them.|I have dealt with chronic pain for the last 20 years. I have been to three different clinics, and when I finally asked the doctor at the last clinic was there actually a doctor who was willing to look at each individual patient  and their individual problems I was told to see if I could get accepted at Suwanee pain management. Although the doctor who recommended me to the place was more concerned with what the government was telling them to do and didn't look at all at the MRIs or my individual problems, I will thank him for sending me to this place. The doctor is awesome! It's not a pill Mill, they don't have 30 or 40 people in the waiting room to usher in and out in a 15 minute time frame. The doctor sees each patient and spends 15 minutes with them he looks them in the eye, he listens to them he asks questionsAND HE LOOKS AT THE CLINICAL DATA FROM THE MRIs AND THE X-RAYS ETC, and he knows what he's looking at. He knows whether someone is actually in pain and why and he is honest and concerned for each patient. I can't say enough about this place. The above comments apply to all of the staff as well. I just thank God that I found this place. One more thing, at every other place I had been my prescriptions all said chronic pain syndrome as the reason for the prescription. The prescriptions that I get here actually have the medical coding for each individual problem that is going on in my body.|As a patient for almost 8 years I would recommend going somewhere else. Why?  I have never gone to a different dr
Before. These are straight facts. Pricing goes up almost every year for visits. Long wait times. ( Have waited 3 hours to be seen in the past). They get a new doctor on average every other year. So there is no consistency there. This is not run by a doctor it's run by a businessman he tells the doctor what to do the doctor doesn't make the rules. They have changed UDS third parties three times in the last year or so.the place they're using now are charging me $800 every time I get tested. If you screw up with screens, or pill counts. There is no warning you get dismissed immediately no second chances.|Have been a patient who receives care and medications for the past five years. They have provided my care above and beyond any other doctors (regardless of the specialty of them, all variations of doctors, any/all doctors in general), throughout my entire life of greater than 45 years. They run a very well put together team that seems to look as if they were a well oiled machine. Shows the utmost bedside manner never have been given the rush through affect,  taking the time needed to be able to provide any and all kinds of concerns or questions. Not sure what Or even how the""pill mill"" words have ever been associated with this particular pain management office. They are very well updated on all levels of the law enforcement agencies and the rules that they have to follow and inform us about any kind of changes that has set any kind of restrictions upon them (office), us (patients), and the pharmacy changes that they are aware of. Having to renew your contract with the entire rules and regulations of their expectations and your own responsibilities as for being considered a patient who receives care from them and follow the rules and regulations for them to the fullest extent. I've recently moved into a complete different area from my previous residents. It happens to be a little more of a commute to get to the same center but has never had me entertaining the thought of switching to another clinic that is closer to get to. I'm a firm believer in the old saying if it's not broken then why fix it. My thoughts about Suwanee Pain Management Center.|They have always took good CARE of me and they still are.And the Doctor Ditaranto MD is a Sweet Heart and Also Jennifer she will help you when you need help ,I can always depend on them and her if she can't help you then she will find a way to do the best she can.And I love them for that,They are like Family to me because I have been going there for year's So I say if you need a good Doctor and good staff GI see them they are the best to me!!! Thanks Again Suwanee Pain Management you're the greatest in my book!!!!! See you soon, Thanks to all of them and staff .I don't know what I would do without you guysb or girls Love Y'all and GOD BLESS all of you !!!!|He is worth going to. If you have legitimate pain, don't waste your time with self-righteous imbeciles at other clinics. Healthy people, even doctors, have an incredibly hard time understanding chronically acute pain. They like to presume you are weak for taking pills. But they will eventually know what pain is even if just on their death beds.

This isn't to say this clinic will prescribe anybody. But regardless of where you are prescribed, you will next find out which pharmacy has the monopoly on filling orders upon walk in. You will have to drive to the hospital in Cumming.

DEA has harmed every pain patient in one way or another, and we are stigmatized by the healthy majority. Incorporate compassion in your quest for superiority so as you meet those less fortunate, you might be viewed as a saint instead of a devil.|This place is uncoordinated incompetent and disorganized for 3 weeks I jumped threw hoops trying to become a new patient and the office personnel procrastinated and after 15 calls was ask to provide more paperwork because that didn't treat MS I was looking for PM as a result of the damaged caused by the disease, I've been in PM for the last 9 years. Got insurance & money... Dropped the ball here! VERY UNPROFESSIOAL

But because my cervical condition is so severe all the providers have been concentrating on the process for eventual cervical surgery. Dr Shah was the first of all the providers that listened to the pain and was able to diagnose SI issues. He told me stretches to perform and gave me some literature on SI issues.

Not only does he dismiss my complaints that I am in excruciating pain 24/7 he continues to suggest that I can work and perform physical actions that I CONTINUOUSLY tell him I can not do due to my spine and back problem. Every visit he down plays my pain as if there is nothing wrong with me. First visit with him, he put either his foot or knee in my lower back, grabbed both arms and bent me backwards knowing I was referred to him for complaints of lower back problems! Over the years I have read about how black women are often ignored and treated unfair in health care and I can honestly say this feels like it. I have DDD, arthritis in back, an annular fissure and other things going on in my spine . I received spinal injections once and called his office 3 weeks afterwards to report the pain has returned and he mentioned nothing of this on 9/6. He now believes as of 9/6/2024 that I also may have fibromyalgia and suggests taking Vitamin D and tumeric...for pain. Every single day I suffer from unbearable pain, which leads to my blood pressure staying elevated and depression. Shah stated in other visits that my BP is high because I am in his office. MAN WHAT??? Good thing I've screen shot all notes from my MRI and every visit with him. He also noted in my mychart a few months ago that I was  ""obese"" and he talked to me about needing to lose the weight...this is not true, we NEVER had this conversation.

I don't even think he's a real doctor. I told him I wanted to get treated to fix my back/spine and not mask it shot injections. He told me what I have can't be fixed and that I was expecting too much. I haven5 herniated disc in my back and I could not continue to work due to the type of work that I do. I brought my short term disability paper with me because the previous chiropractor that referred me to this doctor told me they will have to fill it out because they are treating you now. This doctor said I will not fill out paper and that only came to for paper. How sir???! When my MRI shows I have 5 herniated disc and my pain supports it. Needless to say, he lied and said he will write up that I refused treatment. Horrible experience. Will never recommend. Sounds like they must make money off of injections.

This was the worse experience I've had with a doctor.|I left my last pain specialist, because I was tired of being lied to and feeling like a bank account number, instead of a patient. Imagine my surprise, when on my first appointment with Dr. Vyas at Atlanta Pain Clinic, he personally spent 4 1/2 hours with me and my husband, going over my history and asking and answering questions. He quickly realized just from talking to me that I had been on the wrong medication for years. I have been a patient of his now for five years. In all that time, his staff has always been beyond sweet and kind, and will bend over backwards to help you. I have never been handed over to a nurse practitioner or a physician's assistant, as he is the only doctor, so I see and talk to him every appointment.

I disagree with all the Na-sayers. I have been going to Dr. Vjas for almost 3 years now. I have never once had to sit in the waiting room for hours on end. Never once did the office staff belittle me in any way shape or form. As far as bedside manners. I get 4 epidural steroid injections a year and there is not one time I remember that I was mistreated in any way. I would and I do recommend Dr. Vjas to anybody who has chronic pain and needs serious relief. People say that when someone leaves a bed review its mostly because they didn't get what they wanted from the good doctor. Usually this applies to people who are just out for prescription drugs and the affect they have on the mind & body.|I only gave three stars only because the office assistants where so kind and helpful. The doctor singal handedly has ruin my respect and comparability as a customer. He has no people skills to the point the he talks over his own assistant. I called to reschedule an appointment and he told me that if i cancelled again to just dont come back. Little does he know Im having trouble with transportation. It's the holidays and its hectic out here he should be more mindful of his tone.|Worst Doctor Ever!
I  have NEVER seen a more condesending, rude, judgemental, disrespectful, no type of compassion for the pain that a person is in.  Let alone a ""Doctor"". He even spoke to his staff horrible.

The staff is ALWAYS kind, and if you're  there only to get pills, then THATS the reason you won't like him, because he actually cares and won't over prescribe.

After being a patient for a while now my experience and attitude have totally reversed.
I no longer feel the doctors care about the patient or the condition of pain care and management.
When I first became a patient I was taking 180 pills every month. The doctor said that was more than I could take and be in your program. I was informed I would have to cut back to 150. I had no problem no issue with that objective. I can manage my daily activities with that level.
Currently I have been cut to 140. In doing so there was no discussion about it with the doctor. He basically informed me and then walked out of the room saying he would ""be right back"" which he didn't do but sent the med tech in to check me out.
So much for the care and concern about the patient.
I live daily with my pain and still attempt to have a somewhat normal life.
I cannot do so at the current level of medication and also face the possibility (probability) of having my medication further decreased.
I never ask for an increase, I never have an issue with drug screen or any procedures suggested (although I have done everything short of surgery).|Was referred there by medical physician for pain management. After paying $150 for my deductible. Waiting 2 and 1/2 hours in the waiting room passed my appointment time. I was seen by the physician for exactly 30 seconds to tell me I didn't have the proper paperwork for referral to be seen by him. No. Exam no advice for pain management. Just come back with a proper paperwork withithin 2 weeks first available appointment. Never mind the 11 pages. My physician had faxed to them from the office with my history included as well as referral. I know they got it because that's how they called me to schedule this appointment . This can't be legal|I had my first appointment the first week of January 2025. I was nervous at first because I've never been to pain management before because my primary doctor handled everything but she moved away. Anyway, going in I was greeted by the two sweetest girls up front! I filled out some paperwork and waited maybe 10 minutes if that. They said it's usually busier but that I came on the right day. lol
But I went back and talked with the medical assistant and explained that my doctor had moved away and I had been experiencing pain for a couple of years and it just kept getting worse (lower back) and she treated my pain but since she moved that I was referred to their practice. I had been involved in two car wrecks a few years prior that I believe was the main reason for my pain and that I was excited to start a new doctor because I had been doing research about some people doing injections and if I was a possible candidate for injections because I had read all the success stories. Luckily Dr. Pulido specializes in injections so in the mean time I'm going for a MRI and he said we will go from there! I love having a game plan!!  Before I left since I got medicine everyone has to take a drug test, but the bathroom is super clean and big so you will have no problem with that! I would highly recommend them if you like having clear instructions and having a game plan and feeling like it's a team effort because that's how I felt when I left after my first appointment. Before I left I finished my drug test, took my prescription and then made an appointment for a month out to come back! Seriously, I never leave reviews unless I had a bad experience and I don't want people to waste their time but I decided to go ahead and do a review for them because of the outstanding care I received while I was there!!|I will say that the staff and Drs have been great to me. No long wait times and the Drs actually listen to you, answer your questions and help you understand exactly what and why they're doing what they're doing.
I've been helped greatly, Dr. Patel especially has helped me. I had my wife switch her PM Dr and Clinic to this PM Clinic. He assured me they'd keep her at her current medication and levels and then once she returned a couple times they'd work out a new plan of action for her.
We all have been through the oh crap, I don't wanna have to start over routine when we move from one clinic to another.

So I recommend them fully !|I went into Commerce Summit Pain Management today. I saw a Doctor Emily, I absolutely loved her she handled all my questions. Even though they were very busy she had so much concern and kindness and took the time to ask me all the questions so she could understand all of my concerns. I definitely would recommend Commerce Summit Pain Management to all . Thank you so much Merry Christmas to each and all|The visits are not bad and everytime I go they listen If I have an issue and try to resolve it. The only thing is wait time when you are at the office and also trying to schedule injections. I still haven't hears about that and its been e weeks.|I have been going to Athens Clinic for a year. 1 week ago I was told I fail a drug test for COCAINE. You could have hit me in the head with a hammer. I have Not did Any COCAINE.  I am a 70 year old woman on oxygen 24/7. I don't smoke or drink and diffently don't do no COCAINE
I have never been a COCAINE user. I got put out the program and I had a fit in the Dr's. Office.  They don't believe you when you say the test is wrong. You have not did any drugs other than the ones they give me. I ask for my urine so I could have it tested at some other lab. Surprise it has already been done away with.  I have nerver failed a drug test in all the 6 years i have been going to a pain clinic. The 2 other clinics i was going to closed down. Never had a bad experience with them at all.Thank god my family and friends know better. My primary Dr. knew better also. I called right then and saw him the next day. He gave me a few of my medicine to last 2 weeks. No luck with finding another pain clinic and they probably have red flaged me whatever that means.  How can I get this wrong drug test  proven to be false/ positive.  I have cried a million tears over this. Does anyone have
any suggestions about what to do. I will say this all the workers were nice people. The Dr. did not even talk with me that day. I was told I failed by one of the girls that takes you to the room. I'm so heart broke over this. My life will never be the same.|I went to the commerce location after losing my pain MGMT Dr to retirement, if you need pain medicine or are on pain medicine this isn't a place for you, I have been stable on my meds for 7+ years I was told they were going to cut my meds to 1 a day and put me on bupenorphine and told by the Dr they could just keep feeding me pain meds until I overdose exact words! I have never failed a drug screening or overdosed in my life! Couldn't believe I was treated like this! I lost my insurance and paid $255 and told if I didn't get insurance again they couldn't see me cause they couldn't do injections and procedures to my back without it so they couldn't see me!

She's been on a rollercoaster with me on my health journey but not only listens to the patient she actually cares! The other docs as well!  The staff is amazing, friendly, funny and kind! I can't say enough good things about this place! As someone with a chronic pain disease not being believed for two years and finally figuring out what was wrong after four she took me seriously right away.|I have been seeing ""Dr. A,"" for several months as I try to recover from a substantial fall damaging my whole left side of my body. I was trapped in worker's comp hell during this time. I was able to see Dr. A by private paying because I needed help with all of my injuries and no work comp doctor cared to help me with pain management.

Dr. A is very intelligent and compassionate. She listens and does not apply a one size fits all approach or treatment. She was the only doctor I felt listened to me and treated me with respect and dignity.

The location (Norcross) can be super busy and it can be a nightmare to reach staff on the phone in a timely manner, but that is my only complaint. Jessica, the office manager, is helpful, responsive, and personable. Huge shout-out to you, Jessica!

I moved out of the area, and I miss Dr. A both as a provider and as a person. She is a gem in a city where most are scamming you or failing to provide services you pay for. You can trust this review, I'm not from Atlanta! You're the best, Dr. A! Thank you for helping me.|Dr. A has been such a blessing.  We were referred to her for a baclofen pump.  We live about 100 miles away and she has been professional, reassuring and calming since we've met. My son is special needs and she is patient and just great with him.  He loves her! She listens and explains everything.  Never rushes you.  She was able to set up baclofen pump and refills  at our home so we wouldn't have to make as many trips to her office.  I thank God for her and her staff who is just as wonderful!|Wonderful friendly folk! All pain medicine practice is a tight rope walk for the providers. The balance between the rightfully so law (Fentynal deaths) and taking care of patients. The Doctors and Nurses and other personnel do it masterfully at Summit. Really like that Summit has lots of locations and Doctors. Highly recommend!|DONT go here if you are looking for help with addiction! The doctor was nice  but since it is hard to find the medication in stock at pharmacy's they tell you to let them know and they will send it somewhere else. We did that same day as appropriate and called 4x the next day with little response from the office just keep sayin we will let you know when it has been sent. Meanwhile I'm having to watch the person I care about withdraw with nothing.did not find out the medication had been finally sent over till a day or two after the fact so a total of 4 days of withdrawal. Anyone who has withdrawn from drugs knows that is the hardest days. THIS PLACE Should not be dealing with MAT treatment bc most addicts would have turned to the streets if this happened to them!

I arrived at 12:30 for a 1:00 PM appointment. And like clock work I was politely escorted to the exam room at 1:00 PM sharp.

Brandon then covered the procedure in great detail while also assisting me with the paperwork required by insurance.

Within 30 minutes I was on the table.

Needless to say...Dr. Haider is a perfectionist and made sure the injections were precise by using his X-ray machine.

I highly recommend Dr. Haider for any and all pain management procedures.

Lastly, please note for those reading my review and other reviews.... the pain management business is not an easy profession. And unfortunately when the few and far between patients become angry based upon addictive traits..... any caring responsible physician must remove the patient from treatment.

Eg.,. If you read some of the negative comments it is without a doubt written from the perspective of an angry and irresponsible patient. (Always two sides to a story).  As there is no way he or his staff would ever treat a patient in that manner.

Todd J Tankersley - Atlanta GA|Dr. haider took very good care of my mother who had severe back pain. The office had minimal wait time and he personally saw my mom and we did not have to deal with a PA or nurse practioner...finally good to actually see the Dr himself !!

His staff is very courteous and and he answered all our questions which most other docs had brushed off....we will continue to see Dr Haider as needed.|Absolutely the worst experience with a doctor in my entire life! Office was dirty and unkempt, staff and physician (Dr.Haider and 'Brandon') were rude, hateful and disrespectful. Was accused of 'drug seeking' and yelled at to the point where it spilled out into the hallway and waiting room. And SO much more! I filed a complaint with my insurance company and reported them to the Joint Commission.

One reviewer here said they just want your money and that could not be further from the truth in our experience! His bedside manner is impeccable and he is extremely thorough and really gets to the route of the issue.|The staff & doctors are very polite but they just want your money. I have been dealing with sciatica and disc herniation for 2 years due to these doctors. Put me on lyrica for a year & had me keep following up. Insurance approved 2 epidural injections in a 2 year span which neither did anything for me. So they charged my insurance $1,421 for these epidurals but when I asked how much out of pocket they told me around $300. It took me asking my pcp to refer me to a spine surgeon. Within a month my surgeon had me in surgery. I know this is a pain management place but dont waste your time. Surgeons are gonna give you more options.|Dr Pandya is a very good Dr However, some of the staff isn't! I was scheduled for a procedure, I waited in the the room for well over a hour and a half, she called two patients in front of my Procedure while I was still waiting. Needless to say I left without getting my Procedure. Done and I'm still in pain. I regret leaving Dr Pandya, but that's Unacceptable!|Friendly and efficient staff. Dr. Pandya is a great doctor! He explains everything! My procedure went just like he explained. My back pain is gone. It took 3 or 4 weeks to become completely effective - which he also previously explained. Can't express my thanks enough!|I cannot say enough about how much Dr.Ryan Sanchovic has helped my chronic pain. Before moving to GA last year I had been treated for this pain for over 15 years in NC. I have been under Dr.Sanchovic's care since December. I am able to move more than I have in years almost pain free. It has been a process but he has listened from the beginning and we came up with a plan of care that has worked for me. He does not push meds like other providers I have seen. The staff is very friendly and caring.
If you are in pain, don't wait, schedule your appointment today!|I live with a chronic illness and suffer from what at times is debilitating pain. I put off treating my pain for far too long because I once had a doctor accuse me drug seeking. I was so embarrassed and shamed that I no longer would mention my pain to my doctors. This year as my disease progressed I was experiencing pain that was causing me to not sleep and suffer with depression. I was referred to Dr. Pandya and cannot say enough about how positive my experience has been. The first time I met Dr. Pandya he was, for lack of a better word, excited to help me. My illness is incredibly rare so some Doctors do not want to treat me. He had the opposite reaction and showed genuine care and interest. I wanted to cry!  Over the past several months we have tried a couple of things that are really helping me. I'm still working on the shame I feel over taking (low dose) narcotics but that is my own issue. I've not even remotely felt any judgment from any of the staff at centurion!  I'm so incredibly thankful for all of them.|The staff is horrible at that office. I've had several bad experiences with the office. The doctors are wonderful, but the office staff is horrible. I've had to speak to office managers several times because of the rude office staff I change doctors because I was tired of dealing with ignorant people.|I have been with Dr Pandya for over 10 years. I not only consider him as a great doctor but as a friend too. When I don't see him, I see Courtney. She is awesome. She listens to what you have to say and helps with any concerns I may have.
Since he has been with Centurion, the atmosphere is totally different. Everyone has a smile on their face. Especially Kali at check in. When I come for a visit, she sets the tone for the whole office. Even when I call, I can feel that big smile over the phone.

It took me many years to seek care from a Pain Management specialist and I came to trust him completely over my 2 years under his care. Unfortunately, his office no longer provides RFA procedures for Veterans because they state the VA will not pay for the procedure. After being told this, I contacted the VA Patient Advocate who in turn worked with Care in the Community and was informed that the VA would indeed pay for RFA. The Patient Advocate and CITC Clinician contacted Dr. Tada's office to explain the procedure would be covered. They tried several methods to try and get the procedure accomplished, but the office person was adamant they wouldn't be paid...even after repeatedly told the procedure would be covered. I was personally informed by the office person that if I received the procedure from another provider that I could no longer see Dr. Tada, told several times the procedure won't be covered, and that there was no method to provide feedback other than through this google review. After no progress with Dr. Tada's office, the VA contacted another provider who is known for his continuous service to Veterans and I made the difficult decision to leave Dr. Tada's care. The new provider was equally amazing and saw me quickly and performed the RFA...for which the VA did pay for (I received the benefits statement today). Again, Dr. Tada is one of the very best; however, there is a disconnect in their billing and understanding of the VA. If you are a Veteran and RFA is a procedure that is a stop gap between injections and surgery, advocate for yourself and allow the VA to intervene on your behalf.|Im a patient of Dr Wang.  He has helped me with pain after I dislocated my rib cage while pregnant, i got turned away from many drs because they didnt want to treat someone pregnant with twins. He was the only one that was willing to help me and I am glad he did! From nerve ablations to the spinal cord stimulator, it completely resolved my pain. Anytime I have any issues he gets me right in and answers all my questions. He is very friendly, and takes in account of other health issues and listens to other specialists involved in your care. The staff is very nice. Danny the receptionist is very helpful and understanding. Highly recommend this clinic!|The receptionist(Auburn) is terrible. Twice she changed my appointment time 10 minutes later so I had to wait longer to see a doctor. I put in a complaint. Hopefully, she's fired so no one else has to deal with her incompetence. Everyone at the office is friendly besides her.|The worst!
Tiffany Hooks is heartless. Also the fact that Dr.Wang backs her up shows how he cares about his patients as well. A family member who is 80 years old has been going to Dr.Wang for years without any problems. The problem started with his aprn Tiffany Hooks. She doesn't know how to handle complex cases nor does she have any compassion for patients. She doesn't even have much experience working as an APRN or provider and it truly shows. She adjusted my family members' medications when he was on a perfect regimen from Dr.Wang for over 30 years. Tiffany Hook instead sent him in to full withdrawals and wouldn't even help with that. She lacks experience in basic nursing/aprn provider needs. Bases her clinical judgment of results that are old or not correct. She won't even listen to other specialty providers such as cardiology on recommendations because ,She said ""she knows best."" Doesn't answer her calls in urgent situations.  She truly lacks any experience of knowning a patient is suffering and withdrawals were occurring she discharged my family member and left him to go cold turkey. Imagine leaving someone suffering and not even have a heart or understanding. That is Tiffany Hooks. As a medical provider she lacks the empathy of looking as a patient as a human being and only cares for her and he ego/power trip. I work in the medical field as well and would never treat a patient like this. The culture of treating each patient as if they were your own family member doesn't exist to Tiffany. The Honolulu Pain management was a very good place until her. Tiffany Hooks ruined the clinic and I wouldn't recommend anyone to see her. Try to get another care provider instead of her at the Honolulu pain clinic. My family member is dying a very slow and painful life full of suffering because of Tiffany Hooks. Tiffany should not be a provider to the people in Hawaii and the clinic would be better off without her. The other providers there such as kelsi understand the local culture here and compassion treating patients.|Dr. Tada is incredibly compassionate and has helped me manage my chronic pain successfully for the last year. The front desk staff is exceptional as well.|I've been a patient of Dr. Troy Tada's for a number of years.  I feel he takes a real interest in how my pain/injury affects my life,  hobbies,  and interactions in the world.   I feel he cares about me as his patient and a person.  I'm so thankful that he is so caring.  I've encountered doctors who see you merely as a means to  make  money.  He's not like that at all!  I'd like to share a glimpse of just who Dr. Tada is beyond just being a doctor.

I was experiencing sudden EXCRUCIATING tooth pain this past Monday (July 29, 2019) and of course it waited to start until around 8pm.  Now, I know you're thinking WHY am I telling you about my dental pain right?  We all know Dr. Tada is not a dentist.  No, he's not a dentist.... but he is an amazingly compassionate doctor.  Let me introduce the ""real"" Dr. Troy Tada to you.

You see, I had seen my dentist earlier that day and had x-rays of the teeth.  Now it's 8pm and I am in excruciating pain. (Of course this starts ""after hours"" right?  So, I call my dentist.  I wasn't  wanting  an emergency appointment right then.  I didn't want any painkillers.  I merely didn't know whether to take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, ice or a heating pad.  This was an excruciating pain and I was literally out of my mind and unable to think!  What would work best with my current pain management medication?  (He knows I'm in pain management).  Brace yourself..... my dentists response was a mere ""there's nothing I can do for you"" and he hung up.  He simply didn't care.  I was in unbearable pain and he did NOT care about me at all!  I immediately broke down and cried.  That really didn't help my tooth pain at all.

In the midst of my blubbering meltdown (with crocodile tears flowing.  I phoned Dr. Tada.  Within two minutes he had stopped my  blubbering, outlined a pain management plan for the next several days until I could get into a NEW dentist and he even suggested a dentist that provides emergency dental services for me to try the next morning.

A review should give readers true insight into a person.  I hope that my ""glimpse"" shows you what a caring person Dr. Tada of really is and just how important his patients are to him.

Btw..... thanks doc...I got into the dental clinic yesterday and those teeth.... are gone!!|Dr. Tada, is THE BEST, he walks you through the (injection) procedures, he's like an athletic sport coach or some sportscaster, while he's performing the injections to your injuried back, leg or whatever body part, he tells you exactly what's happening.  His words are encouraging he puts you at ease and your nervousness, and it's all done while he's injecting the numbing medicine and the medication itself to the joints and nerve areas. And, before the procedures he gives a clear picture with a model of the spine to keep you're informed and what to expect.|The doc and his nurse need to learn some bedside manners.  When you try to ask a question or explain something about your pain issues they just talk over you. They're somewhat robotic and just seem to want to get their paperwork done and get you out. The girls who work behind the desk are super nice tho.",2023-09-19|2022-10-06|2023-12-20|2022-09-29|2023-08-19|2019-07-31|2020-07-25|2019-07-03,4|5|1|1|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ_3gHUgluAHwRNdCVcq7xylk,23

I feel quite comfortable in his care, and look forward to getting my trial implantation

Keri Hayes|Short staffed but lady at front desk was nice. Parking garage is super close so that's convenient and parking's validated from docs office (Free first hour) but $1 every 30 min.
This was my first spinal injection ever. The doctor came in and literally just said hello, asked how I was and started to work on my neck.. I didn't think about this til after, but I should've gotten a verbal explanation of the sites (spinal areas), maybe confirming those were the correct areas he's injecting, or informed me the name of the medicine ect. He just injected the meds and dipped out without any after care instructions or how long I should wait. He just said ""careful when getting off the table since u may be dizzy"". I felt like the docs should put a little more care and especially for new patients.|I highly recommend D.O.Calvin Chen ..
He asks pertinent questions and is very engaged with the patient !
( I have 3 disc bulges in my lower back-causing debilitating pain and muscle spasms at times)
.. he explained, in detail,
what would happen with my procedure
.. he put me at ease with my upcoming "" Lumbar Epidural Steroid Shot ..
.. I had canceled the first appointment, out of fear.
.. he was very understanding and through as well as empathetic..
.. God bless you, DO, Calvin Chen !!

from a very grateful patient...

Kaimana|Parking is one dollar for every thirty minutes after the first hour. My first appointment I paid seven dollars. It's not the money that gets me it's the time, If you convert the money into half hours  thats a lot of hours after the scheduled appointment time. There was no difference the second time. I went today, it was the third time and I just had to walk out. Apparently they don't Value patients time. Furthermore, they didn't even request for my mri to review, which took me months to get through my insurance. I give up!|I have always been very happy on everything relating to this office! The staff, The doctors the environment. Dr. Chen makes every procedure and apt as smooth as can be! it's always been easy to get an apt and always accommodated if I needed to reschedule or do a video visit due to illness!  Thank you so much for everything Dr. Chen and Dr. Garcia|Dr Calvin Chen is an excellent doctor, l like the way he explains the procedure,and has his techs also well versed on the things he needs, I can see he doesn't stress , makes it a pleasure to be in his procedure room. The front office has the same relaxedness, amazing, good vibes. Thanks when I'm in chronic pain to be around this staff.|I just had my second set of injections from Dr. Young. Let me use the word ""precision.""   His precision with the injections is amazing. I felt relief to the nerves literally as the medication was being delivered. His staff is always on point to address any of my issues, questions, or concerns  I just wish all of my fellow disabled veterans could get the amazing care that is available here.

Through a naturally medicinal/ non-opiate based pain medication regimen, combined with injections, I'm able to combat pain. The injections and guidance from Dr. Young have me on the road to feeling the wellness and daily improvements in my life

Bad attitude and nasty communication|I appreciated how he listened. I wasn't just a patient with pain but a person with a name who had pain. As a chronic pain patient, I was thankful.

I've had nothing but great experiences as a chronic pain patient. It's frustrating explaining your pain and your inability to do simple tasks, but I'm always comforted in knowing I will be heard. This experience was no different. Keep doing what you guys do; best listen to your patients.|Dr. Chen is very detailed physician who takes his time on first visit to listen and understand what type of injury you have sustained and symptoms and pain that you're suffering from. He makes recommendations on what he thinks would help you best. After few visits I started to have changes in my progress with pain which was better with medications. I went to the point of pain from 10+ to 3-4 pain level. Meanwhile  Dr. Chen suggested a procedure to implant a device in my upper thigh area and researched for a physician who does the implant procedure in Hawaii for me. Medications helped me but body couldn't handle dosage. But! for me I think it takes a lot from a physician to recommend another physician to send you to who can help you have a better life dealing with constant pain. Thank you Dr. Chen for all your suggestions, recommendations in trying to get a better life dealing with pain. I am now at a point to get off medications and see if I can do that implant and awaiting approval from worker's comp. adjuster to approve procedure which takes the longest time at Firms insurance company. WISH ME LUCK WITH THE WAITING!!|I don't understand why anyone would leave a bad review for this doctor or any of his staff.  My experience was chronic pain that I didn't understand which was quickly diagnosed.  As for the injections, they always bring a measure of relief. The staff is very enjoyable to interact with.|The Doctors and majority of the staff here are great. I got treatment for chronic pain I have had for 10 years when everyone else I had seen told me it was in my head. HOWEVER I would like to report a staff member that treated me horribly. I believe he was a MA or some type of assistant, sadly didn't have a badge with his name on it. When he was prepping me for my procedure I asked for the IV sedation that is offered for my procedure (cervical facet multiple level injections), and the entire time he was bullying me, trying to get me not get sedation because he doesn't want to put in an IV. I have had the procedure before without any sedation and it was incredibly painful. He told me ""I will try to put in the IV once and if I can't you will do the procedure without sedation."" I could not believe what I was hearing, as a RN and as a patient, I was appalled by this health care ""professional's"" incompetence and disregard for proper patient treatment. Thankfully he was able to get the IV ""on the first try"" but he forgot to remove the tourniquet and apply pressure above the IV so blood was gushing everywhere, and he BLAMED IT ON ME. Saying ""see it's messy"" and rolled his eyes. If you are reading this Hawaii Institute of Pain, please make sure your staff is able to perform the duties in their job discription and stop gaslighting your patients.|Honestly it's been a long time since I've seen Dr Garcia but I never left a review and I think he deserves one. My daughter, at only 9 years old at the time suffered from a chronic pain condition that was left undiagnosed for months. He was the doctor that literally diagnosed what she had and was so informative about it. I remember me and my daughter crying when we realized this may never go away...6 years later, she still suffers and now is spreading... BUT... I remember Dr Garcia warned this could happen and we've been prepared all these years thanks to him. I wish we could go back to him to manage her pain now however we no longer live in Hawaii. He put our minds at ease finally getting a diagnosis and helping her cope with the pain for a long time until the next flare up and spreading but I'm so grateful for all he has done for me and my daughter. His compassion and help was enough and wish all pain management doctors could be like him. I honestly don't care how rude anyone else is in that office if at all. He is a great doctor and deserves to be recognized as that. We are as prepared as we can be for this next level. Wish he could treat her now! CRPS WARRIOR for Life!!!

He prescribed a low dose of Lyrica to make sure I tolerated it.  It was effective and he prescribed a higher dose.  Within 2 weeks leg, neck and shoulder pain were completely gone.

No injections, just pain insight.|Dr Nichols totally fixed my neck severe nerve pain the very first injection after suffering for 6 horrible unsleepable nights & getting 3 injections from a diff doctor. He subsequently was very supportive to a painful bladder disease with pain medication to keep me sane. His staff is so helpful & competent as well. Thank you all.|Dr. Nichols is very kind and professional.  After reviewing my MRI he was able to pinpoint where the issue was and preformed a procedure that was very effective at reducing the pain that I had been living with for years.  I could not be more happy with his service.  The staff there are extremely kind and professional as well. It is obvious that Dr. Nichols and his staff truly care about their patients well-being. Herd medicine (where they just wanna get you in and out) is something that does not take place in his office.|He saved me. After 20 + years of bad back pain 8.5 everyday. He was able to pinpoint the problem. I was able to reduce my pain level and am able to be a productive Vet again

Thanks Dr|Lisa, the woman who answers the phone is extremely rude and unprofessional every time I call. It's been 4 weeks since their office received my referral from my PCP and still don't have an appointment. I've been proactively calling multiple times weekly and keep getting the same response ""the Dr is very busy but your case is under review"". The only reason I haven't asked my Dr to send my referral elsewhere is because I want to tell the Dr how bad his employee is because he'll never get the feedback if I don't tell him face to face|The best doctor I ever had. He cured my back pain and gave me a new lease on life! I highly recommend him.|Extremely helpful staff. Doctor was incredible. I cannot say enough good about these guys.

Then they sent me back to who referred me. It's unbelievable the painful procedures I went through and for nothing just bills. They had no one on staff to speak with about the bills. They said their billing department was in the Philippines so I would just have to keep calling. The made me pay a co pay for a procedure and didn't do it but didn't refund any of it. Just sad. I also was prescribed nerve pain medication that I at the time was already on for my sciatica but my pain is not nerve pain I was seeing them for. So disappointed.|Shortly after moving to Maui, my knee became quite painful due to arthritis. I contacted Hawaii Institute for Pain and made an appointment. When I arrived at the office, the staff was incredibly friendly and professional from the front desk to the fellow taking my vitals. Dr. Henson examined my knee, reviewed my history, and gave me several options. We discussed them thoroughly and I found her to be very patient and a great listener! We decided a cortisone injection would be the best way to treat my pain. She performed this procedure in the office with the help of a very friendly x-ray technician. Since I previously had this procedure elsewhere, I was quite apprehensive about the pain I would experience. Thanks to Dr. Henson, I never felt a thing!! I recommend this place 100%!!

I have been remodeling my house for the last year and have been having neck pain, but one day I woke up and I was in level 10 pain. Not knowing what to do, I went to the immediate care. Unfortunately, the immediate care did nothing for me but recommend I go see a specialist. My pain level was at a 10 literally laying on the ground shaking. I could not sit, I could not walk ,I could not sleep, I could not lay down without being at a level 10 pain. Not knowing what to do, I went to the emergency room. The emergency room recommended I see a specialist And loaded me up on pain medication and sent me home. I reached out to multiple doctors on island and everybody told me, it would be a minimum of two weeks before they could see me. When I called Malama Pain, Spine and Joint Medicine , they took the time to actually listen to me and even went out of their way to move some of their nonemergency clients around to get me in ASAP.  Dr. Maya  was able to see me and took the time to really figure out what was going on and find out that I have a pinched nerve . Not only was she able to put me on the right medication to help dissipate the pain and help release the nerve, she also got me in physical therapy to help with my recovery as well. I don't have medical benefits and I just pay out-of-pocket. Their prices are beyond fair and I feel half the price of anybody else on the island. Dr Maya is great!She is  professional and most importantly was able to actually figure out what was going on with with me and figure out the proper treatment plan to fix me.|I am delighted to share my exceptional experience with Dr. Maya. From the moment I walked into the clinic, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff who made me feel comfortable and at ease.
Dr. Maya is not only highly knowledgeable and skilled in her field but also possesses a genuine compassion for her patients. She took the time to listen attentively to my concerns, thoroughly examined my condition, and explained the diagnosis and treatment options in a clear and understandable manner. Her ability to communicate complex medical information in a way that is easily comprehensible is truly commendable.
She goes above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction every time I see her. She checked in on my progress, making sure that the treatment plan was effective. I am seeing great results and know that my pain is being managed by a wonderful doctor!|Dr. Maya and her staff run an extremely kind, accommodating, and professional practice. Making a decision about who to trust with your health care and quality of life can be difficult. I couldn't be more happy with my experience at Malama Pain. Dr. Maya is a focused listener, an effective communicator, a skilled practitioner and a caring person. I felt like I received very detailed information about my issue and treatment options, but was also empowered to choose my path toward recovery. I strongly recommend trusting her as a care provider.|I just have no words for how amazing this clinic is. Dr. W absolutely saved me. She fought for me to get an MRI when I needed it. Then I was able to have surgery. She doesn't just write you a script for pain medication, she digs down and figures out the problem. I'll never go anywhere else for pain.|I am so grateful for this ohana based team they were welcoming from the moment I walked in the door. Dr. M has been very patient and supportive of my pain plan. She has spent a generous amount of time getting to know me and personally explaining procedures. She was extremely empathetic and understanding of my situation. She was willing to work with me and collaborate on my healing process.

The medical world of managing pain  changes constantly.  Theres no right or wrong in this field of medicine, its either a hit or miss; and the goal is to prevent harm. Dr Wangs job is to make sure the patient doesnt develop worse problems as a result of the treatment, so sometimes things get worse before they get better; AND he has to address the emotional aspect of the patients panick into the formula of managing pain.  Dr Wang keeps abreast of what has proven to work..I appreciate his support and guidance. Its on me to help myself, and I know his treatment is not THE answer, but it helps me buy time to manage my pain better. Soo thankful his help is an option!! Looking forwards to whatever can help.. good or bad..(The heating pad just isnt cutting it).. lol|I spoke with his office and Dr.Wang, before I moved to Hawaii to make sure that 1 he would take me and 2 have a problem with my meds I was on. Didn't seem to be a problem at tat time, BUT AS SOON AS I moved to the big Island, I knew I was 2 fly over. No problem with that, so my first official appointment  Dr.Wang Changed everything and said if I didn't like it find someone else. Knowing it wasnt that easy to do since I have a pain pump that needed to be filled occasionally.  I have had 6 visits to fill pump,And asked if I could get another pain dr. On the big Island to help control the pain.. he said no.and still in pain since he wanted different  meds in it.. guess who who profited from that..NOT ME.. . Even know everything was good the way it was..
Even took away other pain meds since I wasn't on that island.. now I'm here, NO WAY TO MOVE BACK, AND HURTING... NO REASON 4 THAT.. WHEN THINGS WHERE GOOD ,why change it when it was working..!! THE ONLY REASON I HAVE TO GO BACK IS BECAUSE  I NEED MY PUMP FILLED..
GOD HELP ME !!|The worst.  Don't waste your time.  I went there multiple times and yet they would not ever give me any prescriptions at all.  They only want to insert an electronic device under my skin.  This is not acceptable.  Now they have just sent me a bill for $75 which I will not pay, ever.  Now that I've got this bill, I am contacting my insurance carrier to withhold payment.  This company will not give you pain medication.  DON'T GO HERE!

Great staff very helpful. No wait very prompt.|Been with doctor Tavares for a few months now. Never had a bad experience. Staff is all very friendly and efficient. They are very open about all your options and quick to send you out to other facilities if necessary|HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE  treatment by Damien T. The receptionist and the nurse or staff prior to meeting this egotistical man was amazing but he refused me service because me and my husband were simply asking questions. He was ok at the start and then I could hear him huffing under his breath as we were talking. Anyone who asks questions should not go here because he instantly gets defensive and refuses to take you like he is offended by questions!! Will never return and actually was happy to leave because we deserve better treatment from a true professional who doesn't get easily hurt!!|Dr. Tavares is the 3rd pain management specialist I've been too. He's also the 1st doctor that has actually tried everything to help me get my pain under control, especially since I'm so young and started seeing him as a teen, to where I can function on a normal daily basis, and also not be completely drugged up to where I can't function like a normal human being.

My previous pain management clinic would triple book appointments so I'd be there waiting for at least an hour after my scheduled appointment to be seen, and they would prescribe me a 7 day supply telling me to make it last 30 days, it was horrible. Even one time during a procedure when I was getting injections into the nerves in my spinal cord, I told the doctor I could feel it, and he told me I was lying. He proceeded with the procedure until I started screaming from pain, and finally numbed me more.

I am so thankful for him, and his team! He's truly an amazing, compassionate doctor. I recommend him to everyone I know looking for a pain management clinic! He's honestly the only reason I'm staying with the insurance I am on because I don't want to lose him as my doctor. Thank you so much Dr. Tavares for all you, and your clinic have done for me and are continuing to do for me!|I'm a disabled combat veteran and have been to a number of clinics over the last decade on the mainland as well as Oahu. This clinic is one of the worst I've been referred to. Dr. Tavares is unprofessional, condescending and makes assumptions based on non factual information. He is young and inexperienced, which shows mainly through his biased opinion based philosophy instead of actual medical practice. Hopefully he will get better as time goes on so his patients do not suffer. He allows other people into the room without asking for permission from the patient unconcerned with patient privacy. Communication is terrible between their clinic and the VA. I was told after every visit notes were sent, for the past 5 months nothing was received. This may be to laziness, too many patients or lack of effort. I finally requested paper copies to hand deliver. I do not recommend. Office is located in the St. Francis medical building where parking can be troublesome at times and there is no vaildation. If you have a chance to go elsewhere I suggest it. Appointments never start on time. Search other reviews and his lower rated areas will reflect this review.

He helped me with my bulging disc & with my lower back pain & my aching hip.  I highly recommend him!!!|I am a nurse and work long hours.  We do a lot of pushing, pulling, carrying, twisting and standing in a 12 hour period.  I've been going to see Dr. J and the team at HCPRC for about a year now.  I am grateful for the care they have provided me.  The initial evaluation was with an xray and then manual manipulation of my back and surrounding areas.  The TENS type unit they use to help with my back pain and the hour long massage working all the major muscle and attachment parts really helped with my back pain.  The pain went from a 8-7/10 down to a 2-3/10.  Now, I incorporate both the massage and manual manipulation with my visits and this has really helped keep my body posture and endurance for those long 12 hour shifts.  Mahalo nui loa to the front desk staff and the treatment team for all you have done.|They truly live up to their name.

The front desk always picks up the phone. They have been very kind and flexible, especially if you need to reschedule.

The nurses are passionate and friendly; they remember you and each conversation and interaction, even if it is short.

Dr. J is capable and has witty humour. He knew exactly what to do and personalised my treatment.

I am on the road to recovery and can not thank everyone here enough!|Haven't been to a chiropractor in years, Honolulu Chiropractic Pain Relief center made it so easy!

I had really bad back pain for a long time, I finally decided to see someone and a friend of mine sent me to Kevin. I'm one of those people who ask why or what's that a lot, and without skipping a beat he answers me and in a way that's easily understood. To add to it he's very skilled in different things, so yesterday I got cupping done and I had no clue what that was. As for the place, there are stairs, the waiting room is cute, the rooms are super clean and well decorated (I'm a housekeeper btw so I notice those small things), restrooms are clean and easy to get to, and the people are incredibly nice.|Kevin is an amazing body work specialist! I had the best massage of my life during a 90 minute session. The deep tissue and mobility work on my hip reduced my pain significantly and increased my range of motion by almost 50% and that was after just one session! I highly recommend visiting the Pain Relief Center if you are in pain or just want to get the best massage you have ever had. I will defiantly be going back on a regular basis :)|I've been seeing Kevin for about 6 months and I must say he has been an INCREDIBLE healer to me. My first session with Kevin left me with tears of relief. I have never felt so in tune with my body before. He is not only an amazing massage therapist, but a knowledgeable holistic healer as well. He's introduced different oils that help tremendously with daily pain. HIGHLY RECOMMEND|Can not say enough good things about this place.  The owner, Kevin, is my massage therapist and truly one of the best I've ever had. As a chiropractor, I'm very picky when it comes to who is taking care of me. Kevin has such a thorough understanding of the human anatomy to where you don't just feel better getting a massage, but your body heals better as well! If you've felt that massages only help for a day or two and then your problem comes back, you need to try out The Pain Relief Center. I always feel better after leaving and then my body gradually gets even better each day as opposed to going back to the way it was when I came in. I've come to Kevin after car accidents, knee injuries, Shoulder injuries as well as general wellness. Thank you so much Kevin!|I had a message done by Jen and it was honestly one of the most unique, effective massages I've ever had in my entire life.  I have been getting regular massages for years but Jen's ""pressure point"" technique was just unbelievable.  Because it was so unlike any other technique I have experienced in the past (mostly regular, ""rolling-relaxing"" massages), I was a little caught off guard but I walked out of there more relaxed and pain-free than I have in years.  She said she does many techniques and tailors her style to each patient's needs.  She was extremely welcoming and friendly, and knew a lot about the body's healing energies and methods!  Absolutely recommended!!!|I've known Kevin for almost 4 years and he is a not only a friend but is helping so many people relieve pain and discomfort. I hear many life changing success stories that has transformed people lives through his pain relief center. Their personalized approach and expertise in relieving chronic pain has been truly exceptional. I highly recommend their center to anyone seeking effective and compassionate care.|George & team do a fantastic job. This is not your typical sports massage. George will focu on the areas that need attention versus just going through the motion for a full body massage, they focus their attention on areas that need it based on your athletic activity. As a swimmer, they focus on all related areas. When I think I am fine, George finds something. Over the 5 years since beginning a consistent regiment, I have been injury free while swimming almost daily. I can't say enough about the quality of their service!|Hands down the best treatments I've ever had. George Rocks! They don't specialize in one specific type of massage but attack your problem areas from different and adaptable perspectives.  Maintenance and consistency is key and they're the best at it.

I sought him out for severe, debilitating back pain, increasing in severity over time, but not precipitated by injury; therefore, difficult to diagnose. Even more difficult to treat. I tried to address it several times in the past, to no avail. Dr. Carlson was highly recommended by my PT, so after years of coping, I decided to give it a go.

From day one, Dr. Carlson listened patiently to my concerns & addressed them promptly with a treatment plan of attack! His communication style is abrupt, a straight shooter, which I appreciate! He doesn't coddle his patients; he tells you like it is, describes realistic options & recommendations moving forward, and implements the plan efficiently. Dr. Carlson was very skilled AND compassionate, empathizing with my pain, nailing the course of treatment choice, & implementing treatment flawlessly!

Also, I can't imagine how difficult it must be to have so much patience w/ a clientele in constant pain because WE ARE A GRUMPY LOT! I imagine it is stressful! But respect breeds respect. I didn't take my pain out on Dr. Carlson or his staff, & they were awesome in turn! His staff have always been courteous and professional, even tho they are abused by grumpy patients all day & busy as all hell! They even worked hard to fit me in last minute before a trip, harassing my insurance company for an approval, just so I would not have to travel with pain!

When visiting the office there was a reasonable amount of wait time, usually about 20 - 30 mins (sometimes less), just like most health care providers on island; so I plan for it. Healthcare providers must schedule according to the standard insurance-mandated 10-20 min slots, but some patients need more time than that. When a doctor is running late, I take that to mean he cares enough about his patients to spend extra time with them when they need it. Once the wait was a bit longer. I was told Dr. Carlson was working in a delicate procedure requiring more time than is typical, & would be with me as soon as he could. I appreciated that (1) he took his time to do that other procedure properly, not allowing himself to be rushed and possibly make a mistake, and (2) had I been the other patient, I would not have been abandoned for the next appointment.

It did take a couple months to get my insurance company to push the procedure approvals thru but it was well worth the wait! The diagnostic txs were effective, we were able to implement a lasting treatment, and I am almost pain free for the first time in YEARS!

I also want to add, I am ""anesthesia resistant;"" procedure anesthesia is less effective on me (even at the dentist!). During my first procedure, I could feel EVERYTHING! Dr. Carlson wasn't able to increase my dosage because my O2 kept dropping. He gave me the option to cease the procedure, but I chose to see it thru. Some ppl do it without any anesthesia!
To say it hurt would be a gross understatement! And my coping mechanism: to curse...LOUDLY. LOL! Although I'm sure it was entertaining, I would like to apologize to anyone who was in the offices & waiting room. And I thank Dr. Carlson and his staff for being patient with my ""sailors mouth,"" as they say. I was embarrassed that I kept uncontrollably shouting explicits (the ""F"" word being my absolute favorite :o)! Granted, I was shouting bad words to the wind, not disrespectfully at a person, but still! Dr. Carlson helped alleviate my humiliation by quoting positive research on cussing. His kind words made me not just feel better & less embarrassed, but he made me feel like an exceptional human being because of it. And he worked with me to mediate my resistance during the second procedure so I didn't feel it as much! Although that doesn't mean I didn't cuss. A LOT! Haha :-P

Thank you Dr. Carlson and staff for your respectful service and effective treatment!
Thank you Dr. Carlson for your compassion, patience, and especially your expertise! Your treatment plan was spot on and I can actually live life again! I cannot express how grateful I am! I highly recommend!|I'm a new patient of Dr. Carlson.  I've had several visits and had two procedures done already.  My experience so far at Dr Carlson's cabinet has been great, in spite of my presenting medical condition. The staff has been very pleasant, professional and courteous, and Dr. Carlson seems very knowledgeable and genuine in providing the best medical treatment. My questions were always answered.  The waiting time is no more or less than other doctors' waiting rooms.  For me, growing up in a country where waiting for a doctor could take the whole day and then only some got to see the doctor, I don't mind waiting. I'm grateful that Dr. Carson even accepted a new patient. Wishing everyone at Hawaii Pain & Spine a Blessed New Year!|I have my life back. After spinal fusion surgery I got CRPS. After 16 months of extreme pain and little to no relief from any treatments, I was referred to Dr Carlson at  Hawaii Pain & Spine. Dr. Carlson was accepting, compassionate, concerned, thorough and determined to set a plan that ultimately led to a DRG implant.
It's been 4 months since the implant and I no longer need a walker or a cane to go out and about and will soon be going International for my 30th anniversary.  I have a nearly completely pain free life now thanks to Dr. Carlson and the staff at Hawaii Pain & Spine.

Mahalo Nui Loa

Gina K|Dr Carlson is the most unprofessional Dr I've ever dealt with.
Saw this coming when last year I had to walk out after my first appointment after waiting for over an hour and a half in a room and not told of any delay.
Subsequent appointments were usually at least 20 minutes if not 30 to 45 minutes late before seeing him .
At least appointments with his practitioner nurse were mostly on time and she is terrific.
Care quality by the staff is good but he  is just very mechanical and arrogant-and that shows in his attitude. More an atmosphere of treatment factory than health care.
Had a follow-up telemedicine visit scheduled for today at 8 o'clock --at 7:50. I got a call from his staff reminding me to be ready to go at 8 and they would call when he got in and was ready.  At 8:30 I still have not heard from him or his staff.
I happened to be in the building for another appointment at 9 o'clock so I asked the staff if I could just walk down there and do it in person to which they said yes.
Walked down, waited ~10 minutes.  He showed up acting very agitated, and started lecturing me about making an exception for seeing me in person when it was supposed to be a telemedicine visit.
I offered that my telemedicine appointment was over 30 minutes ago and if it had been on time we would've been able  to telemedicine but I have to go to 9 o'clock appointment across the way. He blew up and in a furious rage said ""I'm not dealing with this. "" You're no longer patient of mine --get out of here.  As I picked up my stuff and started to leave, he was down the hall and yelled for me to leave or he was calling the police. As I was leaving he raged about it being his private practice and I was no longer a patient.

If you have time to burn, and like arrogant, loud voice, yelling doctors,  with average treatment this is the place for you

It is a common staff joke there that you will never be seen on time and at best expect him to be 20 minutes late if not longer. There are plenty of other options here on island stay away from this one.|Dr. Carlson saved my life. I'm in my 40s a general contractor and big wave surfer. Over the past few decades I've been plagued with back pain due to the nature of my lifestyle. I have seen multiple doctors, chiropractors, acupuncture, massage, shiatsu and several ""experts"" to try and help with little to no lasting affect. In late 2020 I had a bad wipeout and did myself in. I was in bed for months I needed help just going to the bathroom my wife said that's it you got to see a specialist so I reluctantly went and saw Dr. Carlson thinking to myself it's just a waste of time I've already seen so many others, tried everything known to man. Dr. Carlson examined me for the next month with several appointments,  he was extremely thorough and was able to really pin point what was causing all this pain. He did the ViaDisc stem cell injections above and below in the L4 area and months later I was feeling really good.  It has now been 9 months since the ViaDisc injections and I have no pain in my lower back, after 2 decades of chronic back pain followed with crippling pain in the end I now have ZERO lower back pain.|Dr. Carlson is a very thorough physician and surgeon.  I am now free of the back pain I suffered.  His manner and demeanor are exceptionally  professional as well as empathetic. I would reccomend him without hesitation.|So grateful to have Dr Carlson perform the DRG stimulator on my wife. He's knowledgeable, helpful, insightful, and straightforward. Post surgery scars/complications are virtually non existent. He explained the procedure, what to expect, and what to do post op, and it's been great. A true patient oriented professional. If ever we need any other pain advice/surgery, Dr Carlson is our go to. Mahalo Dr Carlson and Hawai'i Pain and Spine!|Parking in municipal lot can be tricky depending on time of day.  I ended up parking on the street.  Took my elderly parents...the building had an incorrect room number as the office moved to another floor two weeks earlier.  Dad's appointment was for 11am, was asked to come in 1/2 hour earlier to fill out paperwork.  There was another couple filling out paperwork at the same time as us, they were taken in a few minutes after turning in their paperwork.  We were taken to room at 11:30am, vitals taken & was told doctor would be in shortly.  My watch said 12:10pm & a little after doctor showed up. Pleasant to us, got right to the point, I asked a question he answered then added to check his website for more information???  Doctor advised he would set up a test procedure, the front office would give us a folder,  thanked us and left, did not ask if we had any questions...10 minutes of his time vs. waiting 1 hour & 10 minutes.   No reason from him, assistant or office staff as to the delay.  When we left no one in waiting room.  I guess they were closed for lunch. Well will see how my dad's procedure & followup goes.",2024-08-28|2023-02-06|2024-01-10|2023-10-06|2022-04-30|2021-12-01|2020-10-22|2020-03-10,5|5|5|1|5|5|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,telemedicine_available|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJe9jBDIAVAHwRfSPxB8GqBa4,22

He saw us right away and got our prescriptions. Super nice awesome clinic highly recommend this man he received his medical degree from John Hopkins. Update: I was able to get my wife's prescription filled easily at the pharmacy that Dr. Yang's nurse suggested, however, when I went there the pharmacy tech wouldn't fill it claiming Dr. Yang wasn't in their network, I was too fatigued to argue with her, and ended up going to another pharmacy. When the next pharmacy was having issues with the coupon Dr. Yang was able to procure for me, (Paxlovid is around $1,500 since I was out of network in Hawaii) Dr. Yang texted me and helped get the issue resolved with the pharmacy. As a retired lab tech, I've dealt with Dr.s for years, and this was the first time I've ever had a Dr. go above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of, so if I could give more than 5 Stars, he and Dianna, his nurse would get them.

It has lot of benefits for your health..|I am deeply grateful for the genuine care and attention that both Dr. Yang and Diana have shown me. Meeting them while I was in Hawaii was truly a blessing. I have never encountered anyone who demonstrated such sincere concern and attentiveness beyond what was necessary. During a time when I was feeling extremely fatigued, nauseous, and having abdominal/lower back pain, they both went above and beyond to offer their support.

Dr. Yang, with his expert knowledge and compassionate approach, made me feel heard and understood every step of the way. He took the time to explain my condition thoroughly, addressing all my questions and concerns. His attentiveness and calm demeanor provided not only physical relief but also emotional reassurance during a challenging time.

Diana, as a practitioner manager, was just as remarkable. Her organizational skills and genuine compassion were evident in every interaction. She was incredibly patient, ensuring that all of my needs were met in a timely and efficient manner. Diana took the extra effort to coordinate and keep me informed, all while managing a busy schedule.

Traditional therapies haven't helped, and I believe his PRP treatment, especially with ultrasound-guided injections, could really benefit me. However, I was told by his staff that I need current MRIs for each area before I can even schedule an appointment. The issue is that my HMO won't approve the MRIs, making it impossible for me to proceed.

I'm eager to get the MRIs and see Dr. Lin, but I'm stuck without the insurance company's approval. Is there any advice or assistance you can provide to help move this forward?|I've had 3 visits now with Doctor Dwight Lin. I've had MRI's showing tares in both shoulders and most recently looking over knee xrays. His office and procedures are state of the art with regard to how to maintain our bodies with strength and mobility long term as an athlete and Hair Salon owner and stylist.
I am currently feeling ok with my PT and my yoga to strengthen my body. I recommend getting his opinion, seeing this doctor.
Creating this relationship I know moving forward I will be in good hands.
You will be greeted by Jo in reception and welcomed kindly into his office.|How special that my wife, Marilyn was able to be treated by Dr. Dwight Lin, MD.  He was referred by our trainer of the past fifteen years and he said Dr. Lin was the person to treat her back situation.  Before seeing Dr. Lin she was an 8 or 9 out of a 10. She could hardly walk and within hours after her procedure she was free of pain. The next day there was also no discomfort.  He was so professional and clear with the steps he was taking to correct her situation.  We highly recommend Dr. Lin to the people of Hawaii.  Outstanding Dr. Lin!  We thank you, Marilyn and Jed|I had a wonderful experience at RMR Honolulu. I appreciate the very warm and friendly staff, I instantly felt comfortable knowing I'll be in great care. With my chaotic schedule, I value the follow up text messages and email reminders.
Dr. Dwight Lin was very helpful and took his time explaining his concerns and options for my situation. Before, during and after my PRP procedure Dr. Lin ensured my comfort and eased any nervousness I had.
I highly recommend Dr. Lin at RMR Honolulu for anyone, friends, family, loved ones who are looking for a non-surgical solution for pain, arthritis and orthopedic injuries.|I was referred to Dr. Lin by my Internist.  I have moderate arthritis in my left knee.  I had heard about PRP from my grandson (a physical therapist).  I had previously been told by 2 orthopedic doctors I would need a knee replacement.  I just wasn't ready for that.  After 2 visits with Dr. Lin I decided to have a PRP injection.  Dr. Lin has a wonderful bedside manner.  He listens, he provides understandable information, he's patient and instills confidence.  In addition, he is very passionate about regenerative medicine.  I had my PRP injection in Sept. 2017.  After my brief rehab & physical therapy I am pleased to report I am almost completely pain free.  I can now hike, go up & down stairs & sleep throughout the night without pain.  I would highly recommend to anyone who has been told they need a knee replacement or surgery to investigate PRP and if you live in Hawaii, GO SEE DR. LIN!!!|I experienced extreme lower back pain for quite some time and saw a few professionals regarding the issue. It wasn't until I saw Dr. Lin that I was actual able to get results and answers. Within a reasonable time frame I went from extreme pain to absolutely pain free. My life has changed significantly and I'm able to be active again and enjoy life.

I was open to hearing all of the possibilities and routes to take to help with my herniated discs, but I never felt pressured and was always given the least invasive options and without painkillers, which never helped anyway. I chose to go with cortisone and it helped me right away and has only gotten better over time. I worked hard to get my back stronger and core to help support the pressure on the discs to optimize the cortisone, so hopefully I won't have to do it again. I will do whatever it takes to avoid a surgery, which isn't a guaranteed option anyway. I've been pain free for almost five months and am very happy.|Dr Dwight  Lin really cares, takes time with his patients and is totally trustworthy|Very thorough, compassionate and detail oriented.

I moved out of state 8 months ago and not a day goes by that I don't wish I could still be under Dr Lee's care to maintain my back pain!  He is incredible in every way. He had my back pain under completely control...My back is fused but like so many people I have residual and significant pain.  When I was in Kona Dr. Lee had that pain totally under control.  I'm now living on the mainland and I've yet to find a practitioner who can even come close to resolving my back pain. The staff at Kaloko was incredible as are the nurse practitioners.   Especially Jessica, thank you for your compassion and your sharp mind. I miss the schedulers, the medical assistants and the office manger. Your entire staff is truly the best.  I never needed pain medication because you genuinely and consistently worked to get and keep my pain under control.  God bless each and every one of you!  Sincerely,
Lori Gale|I was patient.  3xs no problem.  My insurance paid in full. 4th visit i call bf for appt confirmation. Was told my insurance company won't cover. My insurance calls them, 3 way call. Told no one in billing available. I call. Same bs. I give msg from my insurance company. Need to correct last bill and resubmit. Staff person gets loud n rude. Won't do resubmit. Guess she neva makes errors. So I no longer patient because their billing person is perfect. No errors ever. Very unprofessional. The person treating me was awesome. He will never hear why I'm not allowed to come. I can of I pay the service in full myself|Dr. Lee is exceptional. I had tons of anxiety over an epidural injection in my lower back because on the mainland I had these done with mild sedation, but that is not offered at Kaloko. Dr. Lee listened to my concerns, explained the current research and told me that I would be happily surprised by the outcome without sedation. He was right. He has an excellent bedside manner, discussed my MRI images and took the time to answer all of my questions. In the procedure he talked me the whole way through it, describing what I should be feeling at any given moment and before you knew it, it was over. I never felt a thing after the initial numbing medication and I was out in 25 minutes total. He even gave me a referral for a surgeon on Oahu who deals with my specific issue. Thank you Dr. Lee.|Extremely rude and unresponsive. After a week of calling with no answer, we finally had someone answer the phone. I explained that we've been trying to make an appointment for a week and that my boyfriend needs an MRI desperately, only for her to say ""That's not my problem. Did you listen to our answering machine? It says don't call more than once."" and hung up on me. This is the only clinic in Kona that takes workman's comp insurance so we're left with no other option.|I took my son there who suffered an anoxic brain injury, he has multiple, very painful contractures. The office staff was a bit rude but I dismissed it as they were busy and my son arrived on gurney which is often difficult to accommodate. Rene Fabrizi saw my son, I expressed a desire to keep him off opiates to  manage his pain (he was overdosed at the hospital and almost died so I'm very wary) she gave me an electric stimulation device which helps a little but really is mediocre and not consistent in its results. My son has been in excruciating pain for over a year and we can't get Botox shots for 6 mons, he needs pain killers of some kind both for the trip to Oahu and in the mean time.I asked for them explaining this and Rene Fabrizi and her colleagues  said he ""wasn't right"" for their clinic, no explanation and the suggested doctor they gave me IS ON OAHU. He can't get there, but they know that. I found this, and their treatment of my son so insulting, uncaring, unprofessional, and frankly, cruel. I will be reporting them to the state and every oversight board I can think of. Please if you have a bad experience  with ""any"" health care provider report them to an oversight board AMA, HMA, etc. they need to know their neglect and or mistreatment of people is unacceptable.|Took a while to schedule  an appointment..But am really happy with the care and driving from Puna,took less than 1/2 hour for the injection..explained  procedure as he is doing it..Great job.|Our experience with the office staff when we walked in the door for the first time was rude.  No hello.  Asked for ID and insurance like going thru customs.  Asked for a urine sample with NO direction or where the restroom was located, I assume it would be similar experience when entering a penitentiary.
The nurse and the PA were professional, caring, and wonderful.  TOP OF THE LINE!
Leaving the examine room and having to deal with the office staff was far from pleasant.  They literally demanded and argued regarding scheduling a date for a following up appointment when the procedure had not been approved by our insurance carrier nor scheduled with the clinic.  I gave them our clipboard with pages of paperwork some of which we did not fill out because it was not applicable to our visit.  We left, took the elevator down and were entering the parking area when one of the office staff came storming down the steps literally yelling at us before she landed at the bottom (with others in the parking area) because we had not filled out a form.  After an unpleasant conversation, she agreed to give me the forms, I would fill them out, and email them to her.  As I walked away she shouted ""YOUR WELCOME"" AND THREW HER HANDS IN HE AIR AND SHOUTED ""AASGHAA"".  I was dumbfounded.   It was shocking.  I walked to my car (where my husband- the patient)  (he left the scene out of embarrassment and harassment).  As we drove away I asked him about his experience, his reply ""oh boy, it was bad from when I walked in"".  I called the clinic from my car (no one answered) and I left a message for the PA to call me.  I have not received a call.  I assume the office staff recognized my voice and did not give the PA my message.  I never post negative experiences, but this is experience in a medical clinic getting advise on a serious problem (not that it should matter) is unacceptable. I've been addressed more respectively upon entering a gas and asking for the key to the lua without buying gas.  My intention is not to have the office staff removed, but for them to realize their clients are hurting, need help, deserve respect,  and compassion. (Needless to say we are providing the income to pay their wages.)  Help, respect, compassion are so easy to give and don't require time, just words.|I have had 2 failed spinal fusion surgeries and a fused foot, I have chronic migraines as well,  I'm in constant  pain.

I've never had a more knowledgeable,  helpful, or caring doctor. The front desk staff are fast efficient and friendly. I never have any issues trying to get scheduled, even on last minute changes. If you experience pain and need a care provider you will LOVE Aloha pain & spine sports medicine!|Friendly, caring, knowledgeable, empathetic, compassionate, warm, listens, and will do anything they can to make you feel better! If any of this appeals to you this is the place to go. I don't have enough words to say how truly remarkable these two doctors are. Take a chance.  Medicine that is superior and well thought out and planned as your doctor plans your path/journey to feeling better with you. As a team,  you and your physician plan your treatment. God bless these guys. My life has gotten incredibly better with them in my life.|If you are having any pain issues, you need this clinic. Dr Kerrey Taylor has to be my most favorite doctor ever. I have been seeing her for years, and the help I have received is in itself phenomenal. You can tell from the minute you meet her that she is hearing you and understands. It's about finding solutions to make your life better. Sometimes tolerable. It's not one specific treatment either. She tries everything available to get you feeling better. God bless this clinic. Mahalo!!!|My doctor referred me to this officr as a final step for pain management for my herniated L5 S1. As usual doctors like to try all the options before considering surgery. Upon walking in you check in with a receptionist behind a glass window. They are not friendly nor do they have personality. Literally stoneface you can tell that the ladies behind the desk does not like their job or seem to be irritated. I met with dr. Chris he was very informative in regards to pain management. He scheduled me for a follow-up appointment to get injections. I came in on the day that the receptionist had scheduled and the doctor tells me that I'm not on the schedule. I live in Ewa Beach so it's not like I'm traveling right around the corner. I know that mistakes happen and I took off of work for 2 days to get this done. To be told that I'm not in the schedule and they would squeeze me in. I took this as a sign to wear if this business cant get their appointments straight I will not allow them to stick a needle in my back. At that point I left and never returned. Your first impression is your best impression. This business did not make a lasting impression. Confused desk people with no personality and a doctor that has no clue what is going on with his staff. I'm so blessed not to have had any procedures with this office. Things happen for a reason|Absolutely the best !!! Out of all my previous doctors that I have been to in the past I owe these doctors the biggest thank you ever, Dr. Kerry & Her husband gave me my life back.|Dr. Taylor is awesome she cares about her patients takes the time to talk about health care and options.|Have called for weeks after having a referral in for almost 2 months, NEVER EVER get an answer or someone to call back after leaving a message horrible way to do business, I will be changing my referral myself.|Dr Tayler is so awesome.

Helping my ex husband who is in the middle of his cancer diagnosis.  Also he had paperwork that says he has narrowing of his cervical spine (stenosis,) and chronic anterior wedging of his thoracic spine right there in black and white. She says all this says your just have mild issues. He has no medical history of even seeing a doctor regularly. It had been several years without a doctor visit.  No prescription history. He had his biopsy and we have looked at his scans his cancer has spread to other areas including his neck. She treated him like a drug addict and wants to do injections in his neck , after we told her were sure the cancer has spread there. He will most likely go to mental health for help because he is in so much pain and they are no help. I'm appalled at the unprofessionalism and judgmental attitude from this office. They don't have any of the facts or are interested in working with you while your gathering all your diagnosis which takes time. Before he could get a referral and was awaiting help his brother gave him a pain pill . His very first office visit he willingly gave them a urine sample. Because that pill was in his urine ( because he needed help with his pain) it gave her the right to judge and disrespect him. When his biopsy results come back positive in a few days and they will. Then what is he supposed to do, who will help him. Please read all the other negative reviews. This place needs investigated.|I have seen daycare centers that were run much better than this place! They are Rude, uncaring of me and very unprofessional. I have had countless problems with them and am perusing legal council against them presently as they put me in the hospital for 5 weeks due to using an un sterol instrument to perform a nerve ablation given by Lynn Puana who  is not only  NOT formally trained in pain management but was NOT qualified to to perform that procedure that put me in the hospital!

Right after receiving the procedure, I started experiencing extreme pain so I tried calling them to see what I should do and I got a recording that said I had dialed a number that I had not dial, it didn't say, ""if this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 911, like most other places do, it didn't say the name of the business, and then it said that the customer I had called has a mailbox that is FULL and that I CANNOT leave a message!!!

I took a half a pain pill to try and dull the pain until I could get threw to these clowns and it took me 3 days before I actually got someone! I told her in a nice way that I was a little surprised that I couldn't leave a message for 3 days because their mailbox was full and Courtney, the office manager who answered, just went off on me! She kept talking over me and wouldn't allow me to say anything and told me that they were not going to give me an early refill and then said that they were not going to give me another refill period!

When I got out of the hospital that they put me in, I had a registered letter informing me that I was no longer welcome there anymore!
They also caused me to be on pain medication for many months longer than I should have due to the fact that they were short handed due to Dr. Rudolf Puana having to leave the clinic because he got caught dealing fentanyl patches. I would like to hit them with a class action suit so please let me know if you would like to as well.
Stay away from this place!!|The office is in a very old house, but it is fixed up very cute and it is clean. The people at the desk are polite and efficient. The PAs that I have seen have been both professional and personable. I very much appreciate the way, according to my wishes, my health issues are being treated in a minimally invasive manner, both as far as drugs and procedures go.|I would not recommend this pain clinic, however, its only one of two on the island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian chain. I was not able to get an appointment booked in a timely manor. Additionally, I was booked to have  a simple epidural injection, which was scheduled one month out, one week prior to my scheduled appointment, I received a phone call from the office staff informing that the procedure is canceled and needed to be rescheduled for one month out; the reason given for the schedule change is as follows: a piece of equipment needed for the procedure has not yet arrived at the clinic. My question is why schedule patients for procedures, that could alleviate discomfort, if the clinic is not properly equipped to perform procedures?
My best advise is to seek a pain clinic on neighboring island or on the main land, provided that this option is not cost prohibitive.
Best of luck to you all, you'll need it with this group. The one star rating is giving because in order to post this review a selection had to be made.|Dr. Puana has made my life bearable again! I had broken my neck years ago and the pain had become extreme. One doctor after reading my MRI said that he was surprised that I could get out of bed! Dr. Puana treated me over a few months time and I had improved about 90%! He then introduced me to a phenomenal Neurosurgeon who operated on me and repaired my cervical spine. I visit Puana Pain Clinic often for other inoperable spinal injuries. Check his resume! We are so blessed to have this highly qualified and exceptionally experienced doctor in Hawaii and especially here on the Big Island!|While the front desk help was kind, courteous and friendly, their required patient dispute resolution agreement document asks you to forfeit your legal rights to malpractice and agree instead to arbitration. I refused to sign away my rights so they refused service. The second star is for how friendly the staff was in dealing with an unfamiliar situation.|Updated!

Snarky office staff. Don't waste you're time.

Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. Carefully review the negative ones and you will likely see a common denominator.

The office manager is an outright bully. They have no business being in this profession. Whatever you do don't question her about anything, or offer feedback of any kind no matter how calm or constructive you might be, otherwise she'll threaten and then remove you from the practice.|Very unprofessional and dirty office and filthy bathroom.

My pain has improved and my lower back and core are much stronger since seeing him. Between regular visits and following his advice and exercises I can lift my young daughter up without worrying about injury.|I went to see Dr. Tracy Matsumoto after dealing with a painful condition called Sacroiliac Joint Pain! Dr explained how Fascia was the infrastructure that allows my movements! He explained my need to stretch, move, and exercise to help reduce or eliminate my pain! A series of core exercises, along with pictures were demonstrated and follow up steps were provided in handouts!
Within 3 office visits, I felt hopeful and relief! As long as I maintain these stretching exercises, I can move normally again!! He also emphasizes proper nutrition for a healthier lifestyle!
Lee Ann, his Office Manager, was so pleasant!!
linde|Went in with the worst pain in my life. Unbearable and in tears. I felt very hopeful going in. Not only was I taught why I felt the way I did but I was given daily stretches, exercises and food/diet recommendations to continue my healing outside of the office. Here I am 3 weeks later and getting better every day.|I was recommended to the Fascial Pain Clinic by my TMJ dentist. At first I wasn't sure what to expect because I used to go to a difficult chiropractor who would only crack my back and do alignments, but Dr. Matsumoto showed me daily stretches and core exercises (besides the typical crunches and sit ups) to help me build my side core muscles that no one really thinks about. Turns out I was stretching wrong because once I started doing the stretches Dr showed me and how to do them properly, I actually started feeling better throughout my day and not just temporarily in the morning. Dr also told me that as long as I keep up with stretching and a balanced diet, I wouldn't need to visit more often. I love that approach to health instead of just ""okay see you in a month"". Best chiro I've been recommended to!|When I first started, I had severe lower back pain daily. I had almost no hope that I'd get back to normal. Thanks to Dr. Matsumoto, I'm a lot better! I love how he explains how your body works, you're diet, fascia, stretches/core exercises, etc., all work together. Without one another, it can wreck havoc on your body. My pain is now manageable (almost gone at times). I have faith that the more I do what he says, the better off I'll be. Still a work in progress, but way happier!!! Thanks!!|Phenomenal experiences with Dr Matsumoto!  Prepare to learn about what's going on with your body, read up and study books and clinical studies on your condition, receive dietary recommendations, hear a lot of information and be educated in the 15 minutes you're there, have manual chiropractic adjustments, work your body (maybe sweat a little), and get ready to do your homework of daily stretches along with strengthening and core exercises. It does make a huge difference because the information you're going to receive are to be forever adjustments that is meant to improve your overall life.|I have been in pain for decades! I have never found any injection or physical therapy that worked. It was a waste of money!! I come to this place and after 4 treatments my pain has been reduced significantly. You will benefit from the services they provide guarantee! Call them now make an appointment! They take insurance too!|Dr. Tracy Matsumoto is excellent. Not like any chiropractor I have ever been to. He's  observative and insightful about overall health as a whole system. As an example I have some various other systemic things going on that have stumped my PCP, dermatologist, GI, and infectious desease specialists and his advice regarding those things has helped more than all the others so far.

Murao's office.  Over the 2024 summer, my right arm suddenly contracted frozen shoulder. I was in pain for months. I couldn't use my right arm much.  I have read about the ancient acupuncture and cupping science and I really wanted to try it before going to my PCP.  Dr. Murao is so kind and calming.  His techniques in massage and acupuncture worked wonders on my arm, body and soul.  In three sessions, my arm is much better. And I feel more balanced within also.  Thank you Dr. Murao!|Dr Murao is a magician  I mean I've been several time and I come dragging with pretty severe issues like gallbladder pain or slipped discs. Last time I wasn't able to move cos an old neck injury flaring up and couldn't turn my head or use my arms properly. One session and I'm back to mobile and no pain.  He saved my day as I had very important work to attend to next day.

I'm so very grateful to have found a real good Doctor I can trust, and that's not easy in my case. I always argue with medical professionals  because I was trained in Eastern Medicine so I need to know the cause of an issue before I accept a solution. With Dr Murao I don't need to argue because he knows what he's doing and have a holistic understanding that doesn't make him just dull or cover the symptoms but connects the dots, understands the root cause and knows what he needs to do to make the body shift itself to recover.
Highly recommended!!!|I first went to Dr. Evan Murao in August. He is incredibly easy to talk to and takes his time to learn about your issues and find real solutions. The acupuncture experience was relaxing and its the only doctor visit where I didn't feel the doctor was rushed and distracted. The reason for my visit was painful periods that I had been experiencing for 18 years. So painful, I often vomited and couldn't work or even get out of bed. During that 18 years, I had been to several doctors, had a laparoscopic surgery, MRI's, tried nearly every herbal or prescription thing I could find or was prescribed. Nothing but Naproxen (Aleve) reduced the swelling or pain. So I took an NSAID and in high quantities until I developed a stomach ulcer last year. I had been battling these painful periods with no relief for nearly a year when a friend recommended Dr. Murao. I was really skeptical that taking another herb would do anything but then my next period came and it was normal, just regular period pain. And then the next one came and it was even easier. Evan also prescribed me herbs for my ulcer and after a couple of months I can tell my ulcer is already healing. I have far less pain and I even hope to one day be able to eat or drink caffeine again. All that to say, I will be stopping by Evan's office first from now on. And I hope anyone who has this same experience will find relief and know they don't have to be in pain anymore.|Aloha! I just completed my 2nd session with Dr. Murao, and feeling fantastic. Some of the ailments I was having are as followed:
Bells Palsy Pain 
Hip Pain 
Neck Pain 
Lower Back Pain 
Ringing in Ears 
And a few issues I was having with stress, grief, and unbalance.
I highly recommend Dr. Murao for any issues you may be having. He's a kind hearted person and listens tentatively to what kind of treatment YOU are looking for.
I'm glad I found him
Love and Light,
Danielle|Dr. Evan Murao is very passionate and caring in his profession!
He first does a small talk to get to know what  my current situation.
He knows where to get my pressure points and I always felt relieved after my session.
I highly recommend him to anyone who needs an acupuncture treatment!|Been going for years! I refer everyone that mentions issues with pain.

I was turned away because apparently they do not do preventative care or treatment. I have no issue with being turned away if they do not provide that care and appreciate the transparency regarding that. The problem was the manner in which they did so. The PT I spoke to was incredibly rude and treated me like I was stupid for thinking pregnancy care when there was no ""problem"" was even something pelvic floor therapists did. She demanded to know who sent me and repeatedly asked ""why would you even think this is a thing?"". I left feeling a little bit embarrassed for how dumb I was made to feel. I am now 10 weeks postpartum with pelvic organ prolapse . I am seeing a different pelvic floor PT who assured me that care while pregnancy even with no symptoms is certainly a ""thing"". I can't help but wonder if I had sought care elsewhere if I would even be dealing with the prolapse now. Only gave 2 stars because the front desk staff were kind and efficient.|I've been coming here 2-3 time per week since the end of May/early June of 2023 following a surgery on my shoulder. This was the third surgery on that shoulder, and I was pretty skeptical of the help I would receive due to some negative experiences at previous locations I had done my physical therapy as well as the daunting news from my surgeon that the operation will likely fail to hold the repair. It didn't take me any more than a few sessions to believe that I was in good hands here.

Every staff member I have encountered has been friendly, professional, and it is clear that they enjoy working with each other. Of the staff members there (as of December 2023), I have had the most exposure to Chelsea. I feel as though I lucked out with having her conduct many of my treatments because along with the clear knowledge she has within this field, she has also made my recovery plan feel as though it has been a collaborative process with my end-goal physicality which makes for a treatment plan that feels tailored to my needs. She has met me with a high level of professionalism and friendliness every time I come in as well as ensuring that the intensity of the day's exercises matches my fluctuating pain levels.

I still have a long ways to go with my recovery, but I am confident that I will make a better-than-expected recovery as I am in much less pain, much more flexible, and much stronger than my previous recoveries, and in a much smaller time frame too. Overall, I am beyond pleased with my experience here, and I would recommend this place to anybody.|Received a referral to OSR for PT after surgery. I could not be happier with the staff and care I have received. The staff is amazing to say the least, they work with you through everything and ensure you are doing your exercises properly to ensure your recovery goes well.

When it comes to making appointments they are very easy to work with and take the extra step to try and schedule your appointments around your schedule.|Was in the process of going here but due to unseen circumstances I was unable to make my appointment. I reached out a few hours later after my missed appointment and Marissa had an attitude with me. She was rude and unprofessional. If that's how you handle customers then shame on you.|Sean at OSR has restored my faith in PT!! I had some doubt about the benefit of PT after receiving inadequate treatment at separate locations.

I love how friendly they are at the front desk and love the location. Sean is determined to get at the root of the issue, which is exactly what I wanted in care! Select OSR with confidence!|I highly recommend this place. The staff is amazing, always walking into a positive place. They  always greet me when I walk in and help me if I need it. The facility is also very clean and feels like family.|The office has a great, laid back, fun atmosphere. I am in my third week of physical therapy for my knee and I couldn't be happier with my progress or my experience at Oahu Spine & Rehab. I have had issues for years and I can already tell the treatment is making a difference and increasing my quality of life. From the folks at the front desk to the physical therapists, everyone is super friendly and clearly very knowledgeable. Highly recommend for your physical therapy needs!!!|Amazing place to get fixed up. I go for chiro and medical massages. This is a 1 stop shop as they have other services to include physical therapy. The front desk girls are always very nice. They have package deals if you self pay to help lower the cost of your treatment plans too. It's very clean and everyone here is extremely professional.

He is THE BEST! He listens, & sincerely cares about his patients. He never rushes the appointment, & truly wants to help better your life & well being.
I appreciate & respect his knowledge & true concern about the complexity of chronic pain. I'm so grateful for him, & his staff is so friendly. They're ALWAYS there to help, & if an error should happen, they are quick & efficient to get it fixed! Much Thanks to ALL of you! I see you, & appreciate your hard work!!!|Just wanted all of the staff there to know that ""You're our favorite"". Probably the most authentic, most compassionate, respectful office of workers we've ever met, (having lived all over, we've known many different offices) but the Pocatello office staff is incredibly professional, yet also extremely patient with old people in pain (and some clients have been downright rude, belligerent, loud and intolerant) but everyone at Pain and Spine does a fantastic job working with cruel and grumpy people and doing so in a positive and productive, reassuring way.

The medical assistants are extremely efficient and friendly while listening effectively whilst working well with the doctors, nurses and PAs.

The medical professionals are up to date on all of the procedures and best medical treatments available.  They don't just medicate and send one home, but rather, they provide solutions to living a more productive and pain free lifestyle.  (Even if it means not retaining a patient because their services have been rendered and the patient becomes well)

Furthermore...the entire staff LISTENS!!!  They listen to what is troubling the patient and seek the best solutions for each patient on an individual basis.  I've seen my spouse feel as though he can no longer continue living with his non-stop, ever present pain (he's a disabled veteran and a hero to our Nation) to now becoming more optimistic for his future, and thriving from the medical treatments he's received!  That's huge!  When a patient's physical health improves, often their mental health improves as well.  I believe this place truly wants to HEAL and help!  I'm ever thankful for your office, each and every one of you have made a lasting and meaningful impression!

Yes, indeedy!!  Y'all (and I mean ""all y'all"")  are our favorite!|This place is incredible. Dr. Runyan is one of the best doctors I've ever met. He's been there every step of my recovery and has helped me return to work and a more normal life. He truly listens and was able to point out the best treatments in my situation. If you are suffering from chronic pain I cannot recommend pain and spine specialists enough.|Dr. Snell and his PA Tyler are amazing they have always been good to try to help figure out what's going on and get me feeling better as soon as they can. They have been amazing to help keep my pain under control. The nursing staff (Sydney) and front office staff ( Shantea) are always amazing help to get me appointments or help needed.I appreciate all they do for me!!!|My husband is under  care of Pain and Spine Specialists . The PA Weldon Richardson is attentive and alert to my husband's needs and concerns. The assistant, Shawnee , mirrors Weldon's professional manner.
Previous providers have exhibited attitudes of the patient being less important.  We appreciate the respectful way my husband is treated.|Are you looking for pain management doctor's?
Doctor's that treat you with kindness understanding and respect.
Then Pain and Spine Specialist of Idaho can help you.
The doctor's there, they know you have come to them because you hurt, you're frustrated and you simply want to feel better.
When I started going to Pain and Spine, 5 years ago I was a mess.
Suffering with uncontrollable pain,  feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
The process has not been easy or fun. Dr Snell is kind and I found him super smart. I have my monthly appointments with his PA
Tyler Hepworth. Tyler has helped me immensely, he reviewed my history and took the time to get to know Me. We have done shots, injections, ect. all helping, but not for very long. Finally I choose to have Dr Snell do a spinal stimulator trial, to see if it would work for me. I was pleased with my experience and decided to have in placed permanently. The Boston Scientific unit has been a life changer for me. The stimulator changed my day to day life. It runs silently, but if I'm having a bad pain day then I can adjust and increase the stimulator for a few mins to get increased relief. I am personally very happy with my results.
Whenever I've needed something, from insurance issues, to venting my frustrations or to communicate what is and isn't working with my medication, Tyler has helped me figure it out. The office nurses are good, kind, knowledgeable and understanding. They work as a team to get the needs of us, the patient's met.
I'm happy and grateful to be a part of Pain and Spine Specialist of Idaho!
Thank you.
It takes a team to make a dream work!!|I appreciate PA Tyler Hepworth so much. He has always been kind and done so much to help me with my problems. I have been seeing him for a couple of years now and he is the one person who actually listened to me and has helped me alot. He is someone who genuinely cares to help his patients in the best way possible.|Doctor Snell is an angel. Very thorough and personable. I've seen him since 2015, and wouldn't switch.
The medical assistants are nice too.
I wish they had benches out front in the shade.

L4 through S1 and have regained most of my normal activities. I've experienced a significant pain reduction (approximately 50-80%,).

Take your time, don't be so quick to jump into fusions, and ask Chris about Intracept for chronic lumbar back pain. You may have modic changes with basivertebral endplate disfunction.

My surgery in particular took about 1.5 to 2 hours, and I know that Chris worked diligently to land the probe plumb and center.

Chris gave me much of my life back, and as a direct result, I get to be an active father to my 4 year old son now.

I'm blessed, thank you Chris!|Wow I have had back problems my whole
life and I've never had anyone explain what the problems is, what the MRI said & how the injection can help.
Thank you for taking the time to explain these things!
Super nice and caring!!!
Plus we didn't have to wait for hours in the waiting room exam room with a bad back like with St. Luke's back doctors.
Edit and update:
I was there two months ago where Dr Vaughan did a needling process in my neck. This procedure is not a once a done process and they never scheduled follow ups or asked how I was doing. I have quit a few injections that did not help so he decided he wanted to try it in a different place. I tired to make an appointment but the front desk people said they had to get prior authorization and they would call. Never did. There was one front office person that was really rude too.
I just went somewhere else. They did t seem to want my business.|This was my first procedure with Dr C. Vaughn and I was treated professionally and virtuous. Dr. Vaughn did a perfect S. I. Joint injection and I had a minimal amount of pain which is to expected.
I feel great and it's been 24 hrs.
I would recommend him and his office to anyone|I had been going to another pain clinic in Boise for over 8 years without little success in treating my pain.  I was reading up on Dr Vaughn and decided to give him a try.  This was one of the best decisions I could have made.  First of all their office staff and nurses are all so nice.  They are so welcoming and willing to work with you.  Dr Vaughn himself cares so much about his patients.  He works very hard to cure or curtail your health issues
@ .  This doctor has done more for me in 7 months, than the other clinic in 8 years.  I totally trust and believe in him.  I definitely recommend this office.|Dr. Vaughn is very caring & honest. He has a great listening ear. He explains things thoroughly so I can understand what he is talking about. He takes his time while he is in the room with me. I never feel rushed at any point during my visits. I fully recommend any one that has pain and is in  need of a pain care provider to make an appointment with Dr. Vaughn at Pain Care Boise. You won't be disappointed.|This was my first experience with a surgical clinic as opposed to the  hospital facilities.  It was not nearly as intimidating and overwhelming as a hospital surgical ward. If the choice is mine I will always choose this venue.   They were very punctual, extremely helpful and over the top pleasant. They  took the time to answer all of my question (many not related to my surgery). Thank you Pain Care staff.|Dr. Vaughn is one of the best doctors I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He not only listened to my concerns but came up with a game plan to help me feel comfortable about treatment for the first time in 20 years. Just when I was starting to feel like someone actually knew how I felt and really ""got"" me, I was punched in the gut by his office staff. This ridiculous attendance policy they have of if you miss 3 appointments they drop you as a patient is the most disgusting thing I've ever witnessed. I live in Caldwell and with all the construction and traffic in the treasure valley it's almost impossible to make appointments like they suggested let alone with a person who suffers from anxiety and depression, let alone other ailments. We all get sick, we all have accidents, car troubles etc. so for them to say you can no longer get care with us once you've missed those appointments is one of the most heinous acts of discrimination I've ever been subjected to. It's a crying shame because Dr. Vaughn is such an empathetic and kind doctor. Hopefully he wakes up and decides to take action against his incredibly insensitive office manager.",2024-07-23|2024-09-08|2023-06-20|2023-04-28|2023-03-23|2022-05-12|2023-08-29|2023-03-10,5|5|2|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ7X3QzAf5rlQRBGyEAzX5OJQ,88

This ain't my first rodeo. Jillian is by the BEST Pain Management provider I have ever seen. Her bedside manner is incredible. She actually listened to me, I can't remember the last time I felt heard in Pain Management. She spent almost 40 minutes with me going over past history, current issues.

They were able to get an appointment within the month!|It took several calls and two months of constant extreme pain for them to finally get me an appointment I needed for treatment. They explained that they had to let someone go for not following up on referrals. Well, when someone in the office is messing up, someone else should definitely be immediately finding and fixing their mess ups and not letting those of us in pain wait so long!|Si fusion with Dr Vaughn.  Went extremely well, and the staff is very friendly.  A few days of pain, but now that chronic pain is completely gone.  Would recommend Dr. Vaughn and Jillian to anyone needing pain intervention.|I called this office to make an appointment to discuss my back issues. This was NOT an appointment to provide any other services...just to discuss if they thought they were able to help with my spinal stenosis.  They would not make an appointment without having my Medicare number in advance (I did not have my card with me when I called).
Before even speaking with a doctor, it seemed obvious that they cared much more about how much they could make off of my insurance rather than caring how much, or even if, they could help with my back pain.  I realize a lot of doctors now fall into this category, but I'm choosing to look elsewhere.|This is one of the weirdest posts I've ever had to do. I was treated for upper neck problems by Pain care Boise. The treatment went well and helped for sometime. All was well so I thought. A few months later I tried to get a follow up appointment as I was experiencing problems once again. I called and left a message through voicemail as well as email. A week later I had heard nothing. I tried calling it multiple times but each time it went to their voicemail. I eventually tried calling from a different phone and finally got a person. This is where things really started to confuse me. I stated my name and the receptionist immediately hung up on me. I tried calling back and once again everything went to voicemail. As far as I know I was an upstanding patient and never had an altercation, argument, and did everything the doctor said. I did miss an appointment many months back but gave notice prior. I guess I am just very confused why I can't get an appointment let alone why no one will speak with me and explain. Please let me know, I am happy to take down this review if someone speaks with me.|The practitioners here are amazing.  They listen to you and involve you in your treatment decisions.  They are very professional and procedures are all done with the patients comfort and care care in mind.

If you are needlessly suffering back pain I highly recommend him. Him and his team are so compassionate and truly get to the bottom of the pain and truly resolve it.

He has always been so patient with me bringing young children to my office check ups. The nursing staff pre and postop are one of the highlights of the office! Both male RNs (I apologize I do not remember their names) are the best nurses I have met and hope they know they are appreciated!|Dr. Poston is fantastic. I've done two ketamine infusions with him and they've helped me more than anything else for nerve pain and I've tried most everything before that. My favorite things about him are that I believe he genuinely cares about his patients and wants to help them, he has a curiosity for medicine that makes him all the better of a doctor, and he's a humble down to Earth type of person. Also, I've connected with other people who have done similar treatments across the country and Dr. Poston is by far the best cost wise.

Today is the third time I have had a terrible experience with this office and this Doctor.  I have been in treatment with another Dr. for some time, his bedside manners and options were not good so I asked around, someone recommended this Dr.  I should have read the reviews and its partially my fault, had i read them, I would not be here today.

Here is the skinny version:  This place is unorganized, they will make you wait forever, every single time, my initial appointment was close to two hours, I was starving by the time it was done as it was scheduled at noon and they asked that I not eat anything before the appointment.  They ask you the same questions every single time, and they have not moved along in the world with technology, every form is paper.  They have perfected ways of squeezing money out of me, and my insurance provider.  I assume I am not an isolated incident and this happens to others.  The reviews I have read have the same tone, these guys are slow, non-responsive, will make you wait until you want to scream and you need medication just to sit through the call.  They will ask you for a co-pay which means they are charging insurance for every call, yes, even to call in to fill in your next months medication.  They will schedule an appointment at least 30 days in advance, they will send you reminders so you don't forget and they collect their coin.  Ultimately, someone will call you, collect your co-pay, ask you the same silly questions over and over like ""what is your goal in terms of payment level from a 0 to a 10""???? ......      The doctor will never show up on time, I am writing this review as I am waiting for my appointment that was scheduled over two hours ago.  Yes, and for sure!!  they did call me to collect their co-pay before my scheduled time, but the main call with the Doctor???..  I am still on hold, 25 minutes now and counting.  Again if this was an isolated issue, then that would be fine, they did this exact same thing to me last month, I waited over 50 minutes on the phone that time.  When the Dr. Finally got on the call, she apologized, told me her team is expected to get on the phone if the call will take longer than a few minutes and that she will call later.  I did share with her that it is frustrating to have an appointment to refill medication, pay a fee, and then have to wait for close to an hour.  I shared that it made me feel like my time is not important to her or her staff.  She assured me it would not happen again, 28 minutes and counting now.  This is a joke!!  My last office, although the Dr. had terrible bedside manners, at least would fill my prescription three months in advance, all I had to do was call the pharmacy every month.  That other office would not squeeze me or my insurance company every month, and most importantly I would not have to be around waiting for her to make our appointment that was scheduled over two hours ago.  What a lack of respect for peoples time, patience and condition.  I am moving Dr.s.  Please do your research so you are not frustrated and in my shoes.  Dealing with pain is bad enough, we should not have to deal with this type of treatment from someone who is supposed to care for us.

quick update, finally 2.5 hours after my scheduled call, and after waiting over 30 minutes for to jump on.  She apologized again, said she wrote a note on my chart last time and now she will have to speak to her office staff!!  LOL!!!!  This place is extremely unprofessional!!  do your research, it will be well worth your time!|Hi, my name is Frank although you don't know me I'd like to share my Personal experience with.      Dr. Sandra Thompson. I've been seeing her now for roughly 7 years. I'm a veteran here in Boise Idaho. Many things that the VA cannot do for treatment of pain. Dr. Thompson has many different avenues to treat and deal and care for pain, in a scale of one to 10 I would highly rate nine out of ten.|I really admire the staff at the pain center. I have been a patient for several years now. If it wasn't for Dr. Thompson and her staff I would have been in life ending pain. I'm still having pain but it's more manageable than before when I didn't have a pain pump. They have truly helped me survive and manage my pain goals.|My wife and I are new to the area. Dr Thompson was suggested by Medtronic as someone who could manage her pain pump.  My wife called Dr. Thompson's office and was told by Deanna that she would have to have a referral from her doctor in California.  She called and arranged for them to fax the referral.  Dr Thompson's office could not find the fax and had my wife have the other doctor's office repeat the process on three separate occasions. When my wife called yet again to make an appointment, she was told that they are no longer accepting new patients with implanted pain pumps.  My wife had made it clear from day one that she had an implanted pain pump and yet Deanna failed to tell her from the beginning, that they were not accepting new patients with existing pain pumps.  This whole process has taken weeks to find out that she is being rejected by Dr Thompson.
To be blunt, I feel that Dr. Thompson does not care about the inconvenience and hardship she and her office have put my wife through.  She is still searching for a doctor that can help her manage her pain.  The only reason for giving her one star is there is no way to make it zero!|I am writing for my mother, Mrs Karther, who waited for months to get an appointment after two referrals from her primary Dr.  After the appointment she was scheduled for an injection which went as well as could be expected and did somewhat alleviate the pain she is continually in.  The follow up and follow thru is my complaint.  After waiting again for over two weeks, having been told someone would contact her in a few days, my mother called the office and was told she would have to schedule a follow up call.  She did and was told on that call after another week went by that someone would get back with her after they relayed the concerns to the Dr.  That was 10 days ago.  I appreciate the thoughts about relieving chronic pain, but at this point that seems to be all the staff is able or willing to do.  The follow up care is abysmal.  We should have waited to fill out their customer service questionnaire given at the office.|I've been a patient for 4 years and Im not sure why I've stayed with this practice so long.

Dr. Thompson is nice and compassionate. Yet I have waited more than an hour - for both appointments and a surgical injections, -because she was busy on the phone. I understand that she was attending to immediate issues, and returning urgent calls, but still, this is unfair to patients with appointments.

More than once, the office staff has made oversights or mistakes that affected me. Here are two examples.

Once I was called to come in a few hours early for a surgical procedure because there was a cancellation. (which I appreciated!) However, I was not ""put in the queue""- someone had dropped the ball and not properly scheduled me in that cancelation spot. I ended up waiting very uncomfortably in a small partition (in hospital gown and IV) for over 2 hours while 4-5 other patients went in -and came back- from their procedure. All the while continually being reassured I was next.
I ended up having a full out anxiety attack. And the pain soared.

Another time I received a very expensive bill for a lab that has always been covered. I had to muddle through things with the insurance company to finally find out that I had been billed twice for the same lab, so the second claim was rejected.(one of the agents also said a test done for an experimental substance so it wasn't covered.?. But this might be info from an incompetent insurance agent).
I finally had to tell the Pain Center that they were wrong and have the claim withdrawn.

The even bigger deal:
An incorrect surgical injection was done- by the doctors own admission. (But I was assured two PA's were fired and my office visit was waived as compensation. ? Ha!)

Finally, The front desk has a brash matter of fact way about her that puts me ill at ease.

My reasons for needing pain care are simple, so I'm baffled by the mistakes (incompetence).
Most of the staff is nice, so that's what the star is for.
The bottom line- BE WARY! My experience could be a fluke. Maybe I'm unlucky. But I strongly recommend finding a different pain care provider. If you are already a patient here, at the first sign of a mistake, get out!|Dr. Thompson runs 2 offices in Idaho, one in Boise and one in Caldwell.  I've been to both locations over the past 5 years and have never had a bad experience with her Incredibly friendly and professional staff. I see Dr. Thompson primarily, and can't say enough good things about her. She has helped me tremendously with managing my chronic pain issues. If you need a pain management consult, the group of professionals at Pain Center of Idaho should be able to help,  but you must be an active participant in your care for it to work. If you're just looking for a pill and some sympathy, this probably isn't the place for you.|Dr. Thompson is a knowledgeable, caring, friendly amazing pain management physician. She has been providing care for my parents and has provided nothing but great care for them. My moms lower back pain has been stable along with my fathers neck pain ever since we made a appointment for them to be seen by her.

This was the best medical experience I've had where I was listened to and the medical professionals followed through with care and understanding rather than judgement. Thank you so much Idaho Spine and Pain!!|During the time of my appointments, I had to cancel one appointment due to a hemiplegic migraine. Then I had to cancel another appt last minute due to Covid which gave me an a sinus infection. While I had Covid, my father's Parkinson's declined quickly and I had to set up hospice at home for my father. My father passed away the following weekend. I wasn't getting better with my Sinus infection and went to Urgent Care and was put on antibiotics and a Steroid taper pack. I started a steroid taper pack 2 days before my back steroid injection appointment. I called the day of my appt to make sure it was okay before I came in. The girl that answered the phone talked to the nurse. I was told by her that the nurse said to finish the Taper pack & recommended me to reschedule my injection once my taper pack was finished. That way we could see if my back steroid injection would work on its own without an additional steroid being given. I was told that Hailey the office manager would also call me back that same day. I was never called back. After waiting for a call back (one month plus) and not getting one, I called the office at the end of December to get back on the books for my 2nd steroid injection. I was informed that they dismissed me as a patient due to the 3x canceled appointments & their policy. I left a message for Hailey and she reached out to me and told me she would would call me back after talking to Dr. Zarse about my situation. Today, Hailey told me that Dr Zarse is sticking to dismissing me as a patient. It seems like Dr Zarse didn't care that it was his nurse that recommended that. That has never happened to me in all of my years of dealing with the healthcare system.  Their nurse was the one that recommended for me to reschedule. I should have not been penalized for the 3rd visit and dismissed as a patient since it wasn't me that actually canceled. They made that call. The hip steroid injection they gave me didn't do anything for the pain and neuropathy in my hip and leg. Parker the PA didn't endear himself on my first visit. He told me my pain and neuropathy was because I was old. I had no issues other than mild arthritis before my T boning car accident. Now I am in constant pain. My hip is at the point that it is locking up on me. My lower back hurts, so does my neck and in between my shoulder blades. Parker the PA didn't seem to really look at my records to see that I have a hematoma in my leg and a closed degloving injury from my car accident. I am having nerve issues with that injury as well but my ortho says I have to let it heal. I also told Parker that I had a concern that the tissues in my back look like they may have been injured (closed degloving) in the car accident but he didn't seem concerned nor want to look at the discoloration, bruising & lumps on my back. He said he didn't need to because my spinal MRI back in a June looked fine.  Closed degloving injuries take months to show up after trauma, and the pain in my back/neck, hip and neuropathy have been getting worse. Considering that I have a closed degloving injury & hematoma in my leg, it seems wise to want to look at the areas again months later to see if I had any mild closed degloving injuries. I got one hip injection by Zarse. I was dismissed from their office for reasons out of my control. I have a new referral for a new spinal doc and spoke with their office about what happened to me here. My mom is glad I have a referral to the docs/office that took excellent care of her back injury and her surgery.  They were very thorough with her, and I am hoping they will do the same for me.|My wife has been in considerable pain from a neck issue. We saw Russell Harmony and he was amazing.

I was quite leary because I had a previous spinal cord stimulator implant years ago by a different brand/company. I had a very successful trial with the Abbott stimulator and decided to go ahead with the full implant. At first after the implant I had an unsettling vibration feeling at the battery area. The team nor my doctor had never heard of this sensation happening. It wasn't painful, but felt like a vibration that wasn't the same ""tingle"" sensation like the program I use on my device. Even when I turned the stimulator completely off I still felt the vibration feeling. I was getting great pain relief in my back and right leg where I needed it, but the vibration sensation was scary and nobody had ever heard of it. Dr. Sandra Thompson advised me to try some muscle relaxers and give it a month to see if it was just maybe a spasm from the implant procedure. I took her advice and the vibration just disappeared in around 3 weeks. I am so grateful how caring and attentive the Abbott team and Dr. Thompson were. I could not be happier with the stimulator now and it has just been life changing with the pain relief I have gotten. I would definitely advise anybody to give it a try if it is advised to them as a pain relief option by their doctor.|Felt like I was discriminated against, because I'm a recovering addict. I didn't know I had to provide a urine specimen at first appointment because it was a consultation. I explained this to the nurse, and told her I had just used the bathroom before getting there, she told me that was fine as long as they weren't prescribing an opioid medication. Then after asking me a series of questions which is normal,p but when I was asked If I was an addict I said yes but recovering, then all of a sudden the way I was treated completely changed. When she was done, she told the provider would be right in, after waiting for 40 minutes, before coming in the room, and whispering about me out in the hall the provider, and her assistant finally came in the room, and everything about her was intimidating, and I felt like I was at the police station in an interigation. Then she said she was prescribing me gabapentin which is a non opioid medication she's all were going to meed a urine specimen before we can prescribe you any medicine. That's fine I volunteered to give one at my next appointment, and they literally made me feel pressured to give one today, before Leaving their clinic regardless and I kept telling them I didn't have to go I could give one at my next appointment. They said it was state law, but I looked it up, and it states if you're being prescribed an opioid. Anyhow so the Dr left the room and the assistant kept insisting on a  urine specimen. So then she's all I don't know what to do then so she went to ask the Dr, and she came back in and said the Dr was in a meeting and I told her that I would need two to three days notice because I had to set up medical transportation and then she got a dumbfounded look on her face like oh yeah huh like that wasn't going to work anyhow to make a long story short I got to stop providing a urine specimen I called the clinic and requested to replace with a different provider the receptionist got the manager on the phone after hearing what I had to say then she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't replace with a different provider because that was the owner of the clinic and she can talk to her or have her talk to me or whatever I told her no to ensure that they're not the only pain clinic in the area that I was going to go back to my provider and get a referral to a different pain clinic|I bring a friend here for her appointments.

He spends quality time with each and every one of his patients .
A couple of years ago he actually saved my life! I had an appointment with him one day, and was not feeling well. I was very confused and not thinking straight. When he examined me, he knew something was not right and immediately sent me to have my blood drawn. It turned out my sodium level was at a fatally low value (which I could have stroked out,  or could have started seizuring.) I ended up in intensive care for 5 days. If he wouldn't have taken the action that he did,  I probably would have just gone home and probably died. He goes above and beyond what most doctors do.  He understands and explains in depth your diagnosis and what he can do to help. When it comes to treating your pain,  he will submit a blood test to GenEthix Diagnostics which will show what medications which will work the best for your individual needs.
I feel very blessed to have found him!|I have had a very good experience with the clinic, however a patient does have to have a different mind set for a Dr. outside the local ""St."" experience.
I had the stem cell in the knee treatment....much less expensive than going to Denver or Utah and equally effective.  This Dr. HAS to run his clinic like a business to keep our costs down.  If you do not get the results you want, keep asking and communicating.  When the whole staff gets to know you they are VERY helpful and I am pain free many months after treatment. I agree, one part time receptionist is a little less than helpful. ...and one is just amazing.|Easily the most dependable, honest, amazing doctor you'll ever find!  Very easy to talk to and an even better listener. His staff is AMAZING and treat everyone like family. I've been seeing Dr, Mallari for 6+ years and he's fixed what the Air Force couldn't. I can actually function now without being in constant pain. DO NOT HESITATE to call and schedule an appointment!!!|Dr Mallari is the best Dr I have ever been to. I had 2 bulging disks in my neck and he fixed them with no surgery. Also I've had a chronic illness going on for over a year and he listened and actually did some research on the virus and put me on antiviral medicine which no other dr has done. They have given me antidepressants and Adderall to take.
I am so thankful for him and all he has done for me.|I've been with Dr. Mallory for 3 years and have been able to go back to work because he will go through all of your past and find what other Dr.s couldn't ! At points where I couldn't take the pain he has used acupuncture, excellent! He just did a procedure on my lower back and I watched on the screen where he was going on L4 and L5 and put something in and relieved so much pain that I can actually sleep every night where before I couldn't. Amazing work, amazing Dr. His staff are 2nd to none. Thanks Lola!|You make the appointment after filing out too many personal info. Especially abt when did you last have S-E-X. along with other questions. Way to much abt your  personal life.  It's a 10 page form. Some of paper work is repeated on another page
The Dr charges $45.00 per visit wasn't told abt that. Paying $85 for the needles. If you cancel it's a $50 charge. Be fire you go ask alot of questions other wise you're going to get a surprise bill in the mail.|Horrible receptionist with a bad attitude.   Then after waiting almost a month they tell me they do not see spouses of previous patients and could give no real reason why.   So now here I am with some majorly wasted time on my hands and have to go through the process over again to try to see another specialist.   Which most likely tricare doesn't have another approved one on record.

This new ""policy""  only hurts those that are already hurting to much to even live a normal life.|I went in for help with neck pain due to a car accident and he fixed it!

Dr. Marsh is my answer to prayer!  His meticulous compassionate approach is amazing. Brilliant Dr. care is worth waiting for.    Also, the Boise staff are a delight.|Dr. Marsh has been my physician for 15 years, dating back to his time at St. Al's. While his office can sometimes have longer wait times, I believe his thoroughness and genuine care outweigh this inconvenience.

I've consulted with Dr. Marsh over 75 times, seeking his expertise in managing my chronic pain. Despite the challenges of diagnosing an often-elusive root cause, he consistently approaches my care systematically and maintains meticulous records.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Marsh respected my autonomy regarding vaccination choices. He presented his perspective, shared relevant resources, and ultimately supported my decision. This approach stands in stark contrast to the often-rigid and impersonal care I've experienced elsewhere, particularly within larger medical systems.

My prior experience with other providers highlights the importance of compassionate and comprehensive care. A previous physician prescribed a high-risk medication regimen (Hydrocodone, Soma, Xanax) without adequate consideration for the long-term consequences. When this physician retired, the subsequent providers demonstrated a lack of understanding and support, abruptly reducing my medication and creating a dangerous and distressing withdrawal period.

Dr. Marsh, in contrast, has consistently shown compassion and a commitment to my well-being. He developed a safe and effective strategy to wean me off the benzodiazepines, a process that took several years.

Ultimately, the choice between a potentially longer wait time and a physician who prioritizes thoroughness and genuine care is a personal one. In my experience, Dr. Marsh's dedication to my well-being has made him an invaluable asset to my healthcare|I never met a dr like Dr. Daniel Marsh.  From my very first appointment, Dr. Daniel Marsh demonstrated an exceptional level of expertise and compassion.
Dr. Marsh took the time to thoroughly understand my medical history and the specifics of my pain. Unlike other doctors who rushed through appointments, Dr. Marsh listened attentively and addressed all of my concerns.
I read reviews that patients stay long in the waiting room. Yes, sometimes that happens, but I know that I am listen, I am heard, and he takes time with me and other patients too.
What sets Dr. Marsh apart is the genuine care and dedication to patient well-being.
I cannot recommend Dr. Daniel Marsh highly enough for anyone dealing with chronic pain. If you are seeking a knowledgeable, compassionate, and effective pain management specialist, look no further. Dr. Marsh has given me hope and a new lease on life.
(I just wanted to say again:thank you, Camelia Stan)|While I liked Dr Marsh because of his knowledge and explanation in detail, I typically have had to wait a long time before seeing him. Twice more than an hour, walked out once, and finally follow-up visit for more than 60 minutes. I must add that prior to my last visit, I called ahead and was told the doctor was on time.|Terrible experience today. First time I was there I heard a rant about vaccinations. Which I was not there for. I have MS
So today's issue I didn't even make it past the .receptionist. She was rude and  curt as I did not bring all my medications with me. I filled out about 12 p before I even went.. and simply did not see the part that says bring your medications with you. .Mind you I take about 25 different ones. She immediately said this isn't the right place for you and the manager jumped in and said the same thing.. she's not asked for the situation was.. just cancel my appointment and I left. Do not go here unless you want to be treated like dirt!!!|If you go there, make sure you know that they make you wait anywhere from 45mins to an hour to be seen. Every time I have an appointment there, be it Caldwell or Boise. I am waiting in the back rooms. They have ZERO respect for your time!!|After over 34 years of suffering terrible pain by a drunk driver accident, then failed back surgery, I'd gone without pain help by doctors who laughed me off and ignored initial medical records.  I moved to Boise area five years ago, and was told I needed to see a pain doctor as I needed pain medication.  First appointment with Dr. Marsh, I noted his uncanny ""read"" of people; he sensed I was  not a malingerer nor an addict.  He also is diligent as a scientist as well as doctor.  He ordered an MRI since I had none recently, but he also listened intently to what I had to share of background regarding the chronic pain.  He immediately explored various alternative avenues of treatment which I always consider worth trying even if slight help, for any help is welcomed in my view of suffering. And he also prescribed the needed pain medication.

When the MRI results came, Dr. Marsh, meticulous and adept at reading films and noticing problems, knew I needed to have an extensive spine surgery, and got me set up with the best of neurosurgeons.  The neurosurgeon performed the serious and inctricate spine surgery, and happened to notice a rare condition that is known for progressive, severe pain and spinal, neurological effects. Dr. Marsh is familiar with this condition and has treated me ever since, monitoring and doing all feasible to help me keep going despite suffering--as he does with all his patients.

His staff at Exodus Pain Clinic is compassionate yet professional, and they run an efficient office.  Dr. Marsh is aware of many treatment modalities beyond what are the usually thought of opioids.  Dr. Marsh is a bright mind who carefully, thoroughly, delves into diagnosing and prescribing from a wide background of medical and pharmacological experience, as well as the aforementioned alternatives including supplements of which I've had some amazing relief and reversals from those he recommended (Amazon carries them!).

He knew when it was time for me to accept that I needed an intrathecal pump, and he is prudent with keeping me at the lowest possible dosing, but knows when more is required.  While meticulous and precise in office procedures that are intricate and serious, Dr. Marsh is gentle, careful, and concerned for the patient's comfort in these procedures that otherwise would be very painful.  He's an excellent mind and comfortable in conversing on topics which support and enhance a suffering person's life challenges--in all facets from support network to pets, from variety of medications as well as supplements and recently researched, inexpensive treatment options.

Dr. Marsh's concern for his patients' total needs--body, mind, heart and also spiritual well being--has benefitted me time and again as he also knows the best of surgeons and doctors in the Treasure Valley area to refer his patients, as needed.  He has a great sense of humor, as well, which helps when pain and suffering is otherwise one's  life, day and night.  If one has to wait awhile, which in my experience is not often, when it does happen I am considerate that there is someone who is in worse shape than me that day, and Dr. Marsh is doing all feasible to help the person even though it took longer than the time frame allotted. I myself have on occasion been that person who needed extra treatment and/or Dr. Marsh's added insights, or time spent reviewing tests and scans.  Dr. Marsh does not abandon patients who are serious about trying to live better lives with the trials of pain and suffering; rather, he gives himself all the more to our care with sincere concern and his vast array of medical training and wide background of experience as a physician who goes above and beyond.

All this said, Dr. Marsh has an uncanny sense of people, and he knows those who are genuinely desirous of doing all they can to manage their pain, and I'm sure he also would sense and screen or redirect those who would not be genuine.  Dr. Daniel Marsh: Great doctor, great mind, heart, soul--and great man.|By far the very best pain management clinic I have ever been too.  I am a disabled combat veteran whom has been through a lot of doctors.  Once I found Dr. Marsh my quality of life went up exponentially. He is an extremely skilled doctor. Passionate about taking the best care of his patients that he can. Goes out of his way to find the best solutions to your medical needs.

It has been so much more effective for me than physical therapy, therapeutic massage or acupuncture. The sessions are short and so effective, I feel like I walk out with a different body than I walk in with, it's that transformative because I can move much more easily and freely afterwards.|I've been to Treasure Valley Rossiter 4 times and the work I have received has always been stellar. It's AMAZING how quickly the therapy works to alleviate pain. After my first session I was able to walk. stand, and sleep with zero back pain. Then I went back for sciatica, and they got that issue resolved quickly. Then they focused on loosening the tightness in my legs (which also helps my back). And all told - I'm very impressed with the work. Much quicker results than I've received through massage, and the changes last a nice long time.|I HIGHLY recommend Treasure Valley Rossiter to anyone who has any need for pain relief, stretching, increased mobility, etc. I went in highly skeptical. I have chronic back pain and have for the better part of two decades. I sleep on a heating pad nightly just for some relief. I've done it all - doctors, different massage therapists and massage types {helps right then, but I'm back on my heating pad that night!}, chiropractors {sorry, never made a difference for me}, etc.
The first time I went to Treasure Valley Rossiter, it felt good, but didn't cure me. I remained slightly skeptical. The second time I went and saw Ellen and it hurt so good! I felt immediate relief in my upper back, more than I'd ever felt from anything else. And it stuck! For once I wasn't constantly thinking about the pain and the ""zinging"" in my back. I could turn my head while driving without it hurting. I just left my third appointment, and I am a believer! I will tell anyone who will listen that they MUST go have a Rossiter session. Ellen's knowledge of what to do to help certain afflictions is impeccable. She is amazing. Rossiter is amazing. If you haven't tried it (or if you have elsewhere) do yourself a favor and GO!|Ellen is the best. She unlocked my body!  I felt like I got realigned, and had more space in my joints to move around. It was like I was wearing a body sock, and she would stretch it out so I had more room to breathe and move after she was through working on me! Rossiter is like nothing I have experienced before, and I have had tons of body work done as well as practiced sports massage myself for 25+ years.  You owe it to yourself to try Rossiter therapy!|I came in to Treasure Valley Rossiter with so much pain from an old back injury that I was, at times, debilitated.  My sciatic nerve gets pinched and sends shooting pains down my hip, leg and into my big toe.  I really didn't want to have surgery, again, for a herniated disc, so when my wife said to try this out, I did.  After 6 sessions I feel a million times better!  Not 100% just yet as there's still a deeper issue going on with my back, but Josh, Avery and Nydia were able to push, pull, apply pressure to and stretch out various muscles and ligaments throughout my body to free up years of tense, irritated nerves to where I can now function as a halfway normal human being again!  The staff is kind, they listen, they care and best of all, their techniques work!  If you're having any trouble with nerve, muscle or joint pain, definitely give Treasure Valley Rossiter a try before hopping on large doses of meds or going under the knife.|Treasure Valley Rossiter is AMAZING! I have rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, plantar fasciitis, chronic fatigue/malaise, and Rossiter has become a must have for my self care and health maintenance. Although I had to start out quite gentle, and work my way slowly up so I didn't cause a flare. I can now stay fairly well controlled on 1-4 sessions a month, depending on what I ask of my body in that time, how bad my symptoms are. I have been able to drop dosages and/or completely drop several medications by using this pain control modality. Anyone with musculoskeletal pain, tightness, tension NEEDS to try this! All the coaches who I have had a session with have been amazing. Cannot recommend any more. I do have to say that health is an investment though. They have to eat too.|Love the coaches and the office staff.   The treatments have made a world of difference to my mobility, headache, knee pain, foot pain.  I'm had my 7th treatment today (50+ years of back, shoulder, neck pain) doesn't go away instantly .  I'm sleeping without as much pain and moving much better.|Rossiter Therapy has changed the way I take care of myself.  I've had hip problems for years, had surgery, have chronic bursitis and a limp most of the time.  Since I've started Rossiter my pain is managed and I can walk without a limp when I keep up the appointments.  This is a totally life changing therapy and Ellen is such a gentle, kind and caring practitioner.  I have recommended her to hundreds of friends!",2024-11-20|2020-09-11|2019-04-02|2019-12-04|2023-01-04|2023-07-19|2023-08-10|2020-03-11,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",48.8|45.8|40.8,"Identifies as women-owned, Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Should I avoid alcohol during the Contour Light treatments?","There are three main reasons why alcohol should be avoided with Contour Light: 1. Alcohol is a diuretic and it is critical that the body stays optimally hydrated throughout the treatment program. 2.

This directly conflicts with the recommendations of the program which calls for a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. 3.

Brian Frost|I have had back problems stemming back to the early 70's with surgery needed to recover the use of my left leg.  Another surgery in the late 80's added more back lower back pain but did relieve the sciatic nerve pain of my left leg.  In 2006 doctors thought it was a good idea to implant a neurostimulator to alleviate the pain but it backfired and was removed in 2010.  This left me with new pain in my thorax and no matter where I went or who I saw there was no relief for my new pain until I met Dr Zarse.  His treatment was incredibly life changing and I will be forever grateful.|Horrible place..  my wife was referred to Karl Zarse.  Yet in 2 years has yet to see him.. a nurse practitioner would not let her see him.  Nurse argues with patient and denies medicine.. let them know we are goin to another Dr. As well as Mexico for prescriptions since they are hard of hearing and cannot close their mouth. Pretty snobby, not a place where a person goes for help.  Really just a money eater.
Good news is last time here, hello St lukes Doctor from yesterday that has a different opinion than a nurse at an office off overland with expensive rent and overhead.|After 20+ years of living with pain from severe arthritis in my neck, I'm finally nearly pain free! I have tried everything over the years...physical therapy, massage, chiropractors, acupuncture. Nothing helped longer than a day or two. But after Dr. Zarse and his team performed a Radiofrequency Ablation on my neck, I can't believe the difference! I no longer wake up with a headache every morning that lasts all day. That shooting pain along the side of my skull has gone away, and I have more energy than I've had in years! I didn't even know about this treatment until I went to Dr Zarse for help. Thank God I did. I have my life back!|As a surgeon in the community I have a close working relationship with many local pain specialists. Karl is very knowledgeable about interventions to alleviate pain and applies superior techniques in his practice. I have heard back from many patients that are so pleased with his work. I would recommend him without reservation!|I've been a patient of Karl Z. for about 3-4 years and he's helped me considerably with my neck pain.  I won't go into my personal issues but I will comment on the low ratings that other people have been leaving Karl for lack of empathy and compassion.  Karl has ALWAYS been considerate, compassionate, understanding and listened to what I described with my issues.  In his previous office and his new one (moved about 2017-ish) he has always spent time and never rushed the appointment.  And that is with my personal understanding of the requirements and pressure of a medical office to rush patients and appointments in order to see as many as possible in a day while giving appropriate care.  One commenter mentioned being on pain meds for 17 years and was offended that it was brought up in the appointment?  Ridiculous...  I feel that several of these low reviews are motivated by a perceived bad experience.  Dr. Zarse, due to his focus, has probably seen more people addicted to pain meds than he can count and when someone is told that they are or have been taking them for too long (most people have no idea how pain meds even work and how the efficacy tapers off over time and long term effects) they get offended.  A few of the bad reviews don't even make sense and are calling him names, they have nothing to do with the quality of care.  If you are considering Dr. Zarse and are reading reviews on Google and other sites, read them all and take the bad ones with a grain of salt, read between the lines if you will.|My dad who is almost 80 years old and not a candidate for any surgery has been seeing Dr. Zarse. Thank you for giving him some back pain relief to be able to enjoy life! Best doctor!|Dr. Zarse gave me my life back. I had RF Ablation of the nerves in my tailbone which had immediate pain relief!

It's now part of who I am, but as I get older, it gets harder to try to pull off living a ""normal"" life without ongoing treatment & effective medication.

Adding to that challenge is finding qualified, empathetic, and knowledgeable professionals to be part of my medical team, especially in the realm of pain management, which has been & will be a regular part of my every day process, just as a matter of fact. I know that and am not expecting my pain to disappear, but I would like to be able to function somewhat normally and not dread waking up every day. I've made some rounds in the local pain management arena, without any real luck, until I was referred to NW Spine & Pain Medicine.

I had my first visit at the Coeur d'alene office and from my first interaction with their Spokane staff when I called to follow up on my referral, I have received the best care I could've imagined! Starting all over with new providers can be very daunting and though I had a bit of apprehension at the thought of it, that feeling disappeared from the moment my initial call was answered!

The woman who answered (I wish I could remember her name!) was reassuring & friendly to speak to, even more so once she saw that my referral hadn't yet been received & could hear my disappointment. She was attentive & gave me some heartfelt suggestions to make sure of in order to ensure that it would be sent correctly to the right place & gave me a realistic time line as to when I could expect results. After speaking with her, I completed the suggested tasks & braced myself for a likely wait of a week or so.

To my delight & surprise, she called me the very next morning to let me know that the referral had come through & I was fortunate enough to be scheduled very soon thereafter, within a week of that call, to be seen as a new patient!

My experiences with this center & all personnel with whom I've interacted thus far have been nothing short of what I needed most. From being immediately greeted & checked in to being seen, evaluated, and heard, I finally feel hope when I think of going further into care with Michelle Brothers, who was everything I could have hoped for in a pain management provider. I look forward to feeling like somebody who matters again, as opposed to somebody else's inconvenience.

(Apologies for being long-winded here but it was important to me to leave my honest review & appreciation, especially after reading some of the harsher reviews, maybe for the Spokane office,  prior to having any interactions with them, after my primary suggested that I see DNP Brothers. I can't say enough good things about the care I have received from them at every level. I would gladly recommend pursuing care from this group if you're in pain, with confidence that you will be in good hands every step of the way. Best wishes to you!)|This is a great clinic so far. The things that they have done are almost surreal even though they should be commonplace, but actually reviewing previous records, doing a good physical exam and really trying to understand what was going on and helping to find the best solution. This is the first doctors office after searching through a lot of them that don't just treat someone like an addict for having chronic pain.|First off I'd like to say the staff is very friendly but also professional and seem to be very thorough in trying to help there patients.|They effectively help my pain with care & respect for my needs.|clean/quiet office and friendly staff!|",2024-07-04|2023-12-28|2023-12-19|2023-10-17|2023-10-10|2023-10-16,5|5|5|5|5|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care|extended_hours|open_7_days_a_week|wheelchair_accessible_facility|free_parking|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|short_wait_times|insurance_accepted|flexible_payment_options|cash_credit_payments_accepted|comfortable_waiting_area|experienced_doctors|board_certified_physicians|multiple_locations|efficient_service,,,,,,,,,,ChIJD_6ks2nBYVMRgBfhuWZnOoI,6

I had went into urgent care and they took an X-ray he said it could be a torn meniscus but couldn't be sure without doing an MRI. It was summer and I was busy with work and didn't want to take the time off to have it scoped if it was torn. I decided to try QC Kinetix first. I was told that if it was a torn meniscus that the injections most likely wouldn't fix it but rather than have any downtime I was willing to take the chance. It helped some over the period of a couple of months but it wasn't fixing it. I decided to have it scoped and that took care of it. I feel my recovery was amazing I felt 90% better as I walked out of the hospital. My doctor had taken lots of pictures when he was scoping it and his PA was showing them to me and said that everything with my knee looked great. He was around 35 and said if they were to scope his knee that mine would probably look better. He also said I will most likely not need any work on my knees for some time. I went back and finished the injection's and decided to do the other one as well which I'm doing right now ""thanks to Jessica"". She is great and was able to get me the other one done at half price per the agreement. The whole staff has been great to work with and I believe it has made a big improvement to my knees. Thanks QC Kinetix!|Well I have Arthritis in my lower back and I'm a transportation driver and listen to the radio all day. I kept hearing about this QC Kinetix and one day I decided to give them a call and I am so glad that I did. I feel so good about my decision so I made an appointment that next week and had my first treatment and it went well. I talked to Jessica and she explained everything clearly to me and I can call them anytime with questions and they get right back to me as soon as they can. There mannerisms are very pleasant. I recommend people to give them a call to hear all about it. I'm sure happy I did.|I really wish that insurance companies would recognize regenerative therapy and help clients pay the cost. I need to have my knees operated on and do not want the painful and long recovery. This option is less expensive and doesn't usually have to be done again. I so wish I had the money. My knees are getting worse and worse every day. The staff here is amazing, really listening to your concerns. I would recommend this place to everybody. Regenerative therapy is a miracle and helps with so many other ailments. I have heard nothing but good about it.|QC Kinetix has been a great experience for me. Jessica, Jennifer, and Aaron are excellent providers. They work hard to answer my questions, make me feel comfortable, and go above and beyond to provide great care.

I was sick of going to drs who didn't seem to care about actually healing or helping me the natural way. Finally a QC kinetics came to my town. From the moment I started, I felt cared for.

They are still caring for me. Dr. Williams takes the time to listen to you, shows empathy and decides on a plan that he shares with you. You are part of the decision making which helps you feel valued.
Nancy|Honestly I'm so frustrated with this clinic. It took over two months for them to respond to my primary physician's referral. They cancelled my first appointment. Got in once and the treatment worked great. Finally after dealing with chronic back pain there's an answer! And then they go and cancel my second appointment...and reschedule it for a month out from that. Why am I being punished for their inability to manage their schedule?

Then I get a call - they canceled THAT appointment and now I've got to wait another month. And I can't just get on a last minute appointment cancellation list, I have to plan around this for work.

I'll be reaching out to my primary to see if there are other places to get this treatment. This is unacceptable. Patients who are seeking this care are doing so because they have debilitating pain. Based on the success of my one and only treatment, I could've been pain free within a month. Instead I've being strung on for half a year and my pain has only gotten worse. What a joke.|The staff is very professional kind, and  helpful. I appreciate the friendliness of the doctor and his nurses through the procedure. I would differently recommend Dr. Edward's to my family and friends.|After my referral, it took over 2 months until they could see me, and the scheduling itself was about 5 weeks before they could even discuss getting me on the calendar.  I was ready to trash these guys, like quite a few of the others here, but things changed for me when I actually came in for my appt.

It started with reception as they were friendly and personable.  Also, the medical assistant, Corina, was genuine and a great representative  for St. Als.  But, the highlight was Dr. Williams himself.  Dr. Williams walked me through, in detail, my MRI, my options, and then answered all of my questions in a very professional and compassionate way.  I felt like he guinuinely cared, and his kindness and passion for what he does was evident in everything he said and did.

While their staffing shortages and scheduling experience was trying, the actual care from the front desk on, was exceptional.

I'm sure others have been frustrated, but I can say that I've rarely felt more positive about a medical team, and I've had way more than my share of healthcare experiences.

If you can afford the wait to be seen, I highly recommend Dr. Williams and the team.|Took months for referral to get to them and when they finally scheduled a month out, they canceled and rescheduled it,  then called the day before THAT second appointment to cancel as well and want to schedule another month out. What a joke! Asking doctor to refer somewhere that cares about their patients!|This is another vessel in the st ALS money machine.  They are not here to perform medicine,  they are there to make money.  I was referred here,  brought stacks of records  with me.  In desperate for a solution.   Dr and I agreed that surgery isn't best option, nor are trigger point injections, been there done that.   He told me what he can offer are surgery, meds, injections.  And if that's not what I want he can't help.  He said I will refer you to my colleagues.    Not once did he look at any of my records.  He had 4-5 year old images from the saint Al's network as reference.   This is the 3rd doctor to do the same thing from this institution.  Oh you don't want our highest grossing service? Well I'll send you to someone else.    I will be calling today to ask for charges to be reversed or lowered.  Nobody performed any type of medicine, nor did they give me advice, direction, or any answers nor hope.   This is the new era of medicine folks.  The healers are gone, and it's about the cash grab.   If you have a doctor that listens and actually tries to find root problems to heal you.  Stick with them!
If you just want a quick injection, meds, or surgery without an  understanding of why;  this is the place for you.   But if you want to get healed or have an understanding of how to manage your symptoms,  I'm sorry to say this is not the place.    I am going to see this through and talk to the referred physician.  But I've also made appts with different providers.    I walked in months ago saying I was at my wits end.  Now I'm continually getting passed off to another person.   Thank god I'm not suicidal!  My lasting impression is that They don't care about the person, it's about protecting their best interests financially and legally.

I waited a couple days to post this,  I didn't want to just react.  But now that I've digested it.  I recognize the whole thing was a farce.   Goto your appt here knowing what you want and think will help.   Recognize that they are in the money making business, and sometimes treatment plans are eschewed to support that.     If anything changes in my situation, I will update this review.   But after 3 appts and now another referral,  I'm sorry to say that this is the best they can get.|This used to be a good place providing great care. I have been a patient for several years. However, the staff turnover is very HIGH!  Recently had a bad experience with one of their fairly new PAs.  Zachary Njorge.  Terrible understanding of patients needs.  Recently had surgery, right knee replacement. As I have existing issues, my need for a higher temporary pain management regime was needed. After 6 weeks of contacting this clinic, my last conversation with Zachary, I was told find another pain clinic when he tried to express his ""personal"" opinion rather than his professional commitment and I politely responded that I honestly wasn't interested in personal opinion and we needed to talk about handling the changes in my treatment. I now have a frozen muscle and have to go into immediate manipulation surgery for lack of proper care. I trusted this clinic (St. Alphonsus Comprehensive Pain and Spine).  Never have I ever been made to feel so disregarded. This treatment is unexceptionable.  I will be reporting this establishment to the medical board and expressing caution for anyone even entertaining using Zachary Njorge for pain management. BEWARE!|If I could rate it a quarter star I would. As the door was open for my appointment has been nothing but a comedy of error from day one.

I will never go back. Very unprofessional and lack of ethics.|Burley Pain and Spine, is a health center that has shown a complete lack of professionalism and basic communication skills. My experience with this center has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing.

I had an appointment with their doctor on February 14th, 2023, for a consultation on the possibility of receiving an epidural for my herniated disk that was causing numbness in my left arm. After being approved by the doctor, I was told that they would contact my insurance for approval. However, I did not hear back from them for two and a half weeks, despite being told that it wouldn't take that long.

When I tried to call them to inquire about the delay, I was always directed to leave a message, and they never returned my calls promptly. Finally, on March 7th, I received a voicemail from their surgery center stating that they were ready to schedule an appointment with me. I provided them with my availability dates for March, and they left me a voicemail on the 16th of March, proposing a date that was not available as per my schedule.

The incompetence of Burley Pain and Spine is mind-boggling. They could not even schedule a simple appointment properly. They informed me that I had to be seen in the clinic (AGAIN) before they could schedule the injection, as it had been over 30 days since I had been seen. This is ridiculous, considering that I had been waiting for them to get back to me for weeks.

If you are looking for efficient and professional medical care, I strongly advise against visiting Burley Pain and Spine. Their lack of communication, disregard for patients' time and well-being, and general incompetence are simply unacceptable.

I hope this review serves as a warning to others, and that they do better in the future.

Edit for update. It's been 4 months and the new issue is that apparently, they only have someone in billing maybe every week and a half. Their voicemail claims someone will call back within 24 hours or the next business day, however the last two or three times I've tried to call to make payments, nobody answers the phone and they don't call back until a week and a half later. I have, multiple times, left my schedule so that they knew when I would be available for a phone call. They still called me when I was at work (the one time they would call after a week and a half, anyhow). I finally left a message saying strictly, DO NOT CALL ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS, and gave them my work schedule. Otherwise, I figure they might as well write the bill off. I am throughly frustrated and disgusted by their services and will not be seeking treatment here ever again.|I've been a chronic pain patient for 26 years, I've met a lot of doctors both good and bad. Dr.Roe is one of the best doctors I've worked with, he is fair and treats me very good, he communicates with me and works with me which is extremely important to me, especially in these times. His new P.A Lindsey is also amazing to work with. I could not ask for a better clinic to work with. The ladies in the front office are outstanding in their abilities and are very easy to work with.

She hung up on me several times and threatened to send me to collections. I have only had two visits with this office and paid both times out of pocket. She also insinuated that because I don't have insurance there is no way I would have been seen which is in fact a lie. Dr guy is also a joke. They all treat you as if you want opioids. She literally looked me dead in the eye and said she wasn't prescribing opioids. I never asked and was only wanting to find answers to my pain which I finally found a dr that looked into my mri and helped you without the use of drugs. This office should be ashamed. Unless you aren't walking in there with a cane they treat you like a drug addict. Horrible place, move on!|I was a patient of Dr. Guy for 13 years. I followed her from St. Al's in Boise to her beginnings of Beacon Pain Clinic. At St. Al's I seen her once every 3 months, but after starting Beacon Pain and having a low number of clients at the beginning, I had to see her once every 2 months.
Now after 13 year I received a letter in the mail (which took 2 weeks to get to me from the date on the letter head) letting me know she no longer wanted to see me because of a commitment I made to her. After 13 years of seeing her we knew each other quite well, but somewhere in in-between she changed her personal boundaries and I missed the signs. But to dump a patient that receives monthly medication for chronic pain with a 2 week notice is wrong. She knows there is no way a person can get into a new pain clinic in 2 weeks, let alone 2 months.
After reading her reviews, it sounds like I was not the only one to receive this kind of treatment. I guess I should of realized what kind of person she was/is after I learned that she couldn't keep employees. Also if you're reading this, I dare you to call her phone # listen to the 54 second message, leave a message, and see just how long it takes for someone to call you back.
Oh yeah, detox was aweful and the pain is so miserable I can barely move, but hopefully in another month, I might find a new pain management doctor. I prey everyday that I can anyway.
She's the devil in a white smock who interests have change, and just wants to take care of her new Spa business.|Dr. Guy is the best of the best in this expertise! I've seen her for years and she is patient, knowledgeable, compassionate and creative  with her resources and finding ways to provide relief! I pray she never retires!!! If you're looking for someone who cares about the person, has an excellent bedside manor and will find a way to bring relief Dr. Guy is the Doc you need!|Dr. Rebekah Guy has been my pain management doctor for years. She is THE BEST not only in my opinion, but in my other doctors opinions too. She's thorough, runs complete check ups, doesn't over med, doesn't under med, is reliable, and I find her sweet calm demeanor very refreshing. I've known Dr. Guy probably since she first started out as a MD and she's still the same sweet doctor I've always known. I am getting ready for surgery and she's never given up on me. Do not try to pull the wool over her eyes with narcotics seeking because she's a great doctor and will not play that game. I've had one other pm doctor before her who used to throw meds at me and when I didn't reorder them each month, he'd simply call them to be refilled anyway. I hated that and appreciate how Dr. Guy checks our meds, does UAs randomly. It's a way to protect me, but also protect herself. I've never had a problem with her or her lovely staff. She truly is a miracle worker in many lives with chronic, severe pain. When my pain gets too much I go unconscious. Since she's been taking care of my pain, she's resolving that by getting me the help I need like finding a surgeon to help relieve my pain plus a medication schedule. Meds are not meant to take ALL of the pain away - they are used with other things like P.T. and shots to give a better quality of life. If you don't like Dr. Guy it's probably because you're abusing your meds or trying to. We need more doctors like Rebekah Guy! My referring doctor ONLY refers her to his patients that need to go into pain management. And I trust her completely. You won't find a better doctor anywhere!
Tonya V.|My wife has been on a pain management protocol for more than a decade. We relocated to the area and she was referred to this clinic. These people are the worst! In 4 months, they have yet to return a call or even scheduled an appointment.  We've had all of her records and a personal letter from her former physician sent, and still no response.|I saw Rebekah Guy several years ago (in 2019-2021)following a referral that i requested. . I was very clear on my needs and how much medication I took at the time to deal with headaches and other related pain. I actually took and wanted less than most docs are asked to prescribe!! I thought i was a pain doc's dream patient given how little i was requesting i was going in for my regular appointments, getting urinalysis'and meeting with the doc. I would report when and how much medication I took before the urinalysis and it never differed! So very shockingly after an appointment I received a formal letter in the mail  stating I was being dropped as a patient because what I Reported I took did now show in my urinalysis and that she suspected I was breach ing my patient contract..my husband and I pieced together as her thinking  I was selling my pills when it couldn't be further from the truth!!
Some ppl would take 1 full pill as a dose..I only took a half pill as my dose. I had mentioned that I had taken it 6-8 hours or more  before my appointment!! There was no consideration given to half-life and metabolism in my body processing the meds!! Nope. She just simply accused the cop's wife (the cop, who at the time was working with the DEA to crack down on major dealers of pills in the Treasure Valley)of selling pills!!  I was so angry getting this letter and inflamed that I could barely speak (which is a feat for me! Lol !! I was incredulous that I'd been accused of such a thing when I only was taking 1/2 pills 2-3 times a week!! I would've laughed had I not been so angry! And I wasn't allowed to defend myself with her or the clinic bc I was no longer a patient that could make an appointment or talk to her directly!!
So...be careful of what you may be accused of by the staff!! You could become a drug addict or dealer depending on how they see you as a patient!!

Oh and their restroom is not wheelchair accessible per Google!) by a long shot!! Think ""barely bigger than an airplane bathroom!! This is a converted old house when bathrooms weren't considered needing to be beg! But don't advertise it's accessible when ppl in wheelchairs weren't asked The wheelchair fit in but the dance my husband had to to do to get us in there was sad!! As I remember there were no safety bars around the toilet either i mean..What business doesn't provide those for liability purposes!!

The staff did not know now to cope with my need to urinate into a toilet ""hat"" and not directly into a cup!! They acted SO put out by it!! They are medical staff who..likely worked with a variety of patients and they acted like I was the first patient to be such a pain!!|I've been with Dr. Guy for more than 3 years. She is my 3rd pain management doctor and by far the best. Dr. Guy listens-really listens-to her patients, and doesn't treat us like she's doing us a favor. She cares about how our pain effects our quality of life, and is always open to discussing our treatment plan, making changes and helping us to live normal, productive lives, again. Katie, Rachel and Ashley (her office staff) are the best ladies, and work really hard to keep things flowing smoothly!!|This is the best doctor I have ever seen and I have seen several doctors with all the stuff I have going on in my life and I still yet to meet a doctor as good as her. She really listens to what you say and wants to help you. I couldn't get no answers about what was going on with me until I started seeing her and I'm finally starting to understand why. I'm so thankful that I have found an amazing Dr. to help me along this journey and cares about what is going on with my condition. Her staff are also so friendly and helpful. #grateful",2024-11-21|2024-02-12|2023-05-24|2016-04-19|2023-07-08|2023-07-26|2019-12-30|2016-09-23,1|1|5|5|1|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,wheelchair_accessible_facility|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJF09HEPz4rlQRcZVHGbFN5KE,26

I have RSD ( reflex sympathetic dystrophy) it is known as suicide disease. I have never had a problem with Dr whiting staff or himself. When I need medication or when I HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STRONGER MED FOR A LITTLE AND THEN GO BACK DOWN. When I don't need it. Through all this I find him to be compassionate, smart, extremely knowledgeable , honest . There is no one who knows everything. And if he doesn't know he looks it up right there. I cannot believe some  of the negative comments on his reviews. It is the total opposite of his character that I have seen. Because of my condition I have seen a lot of doctors and I think he's the top of the line..|If I could give more stars, I would....I have gone here on and off for about 4 years and continue to be more and more impressed with the care I receive. Dr. Whiting is very compassionate, very knowledgeable and takes the time to actually check in with you and teach you about how the body works, receives pain signals, etc. Recently I have been seeing Jana, who is a total gem. She  is so very sweet and actually cares about your well-being. It's very refreshing to see Dr's who want to treat you with the least amount and lowest dose of meds, while still being effective. The front  desk staff is very helpful and get back to you right away when you leave a message. The office also incorporates modern treatment options, including laser tissue therapy for pain management.  Thank you for continuing to serve me and the community in the best way possible. I hope I don't  ever have to see another office  for these services.|Have been a patient of Dr. Whiting for 10 years..it's a great clinic, well staffed and very caring..Finding a pain mgmt. clinic in any city isn't easy, thus I have been driving almost 200 mi. round trip, now that I no longer live in the Coeur d'Alene area, that's how important this clinic is for my specific medical needs..thx Dr. W. & staff!|Very unprofessional I had 1 assessment and than some providers quit. They lost my files and could not find accurate information. Than billed my insurance for an account they claimed didn't exist. Appointments were canceled in same day when I came from 45 minutes away. When I called to reschedule  days in advance and  nobody called me until 1 hour later the receptionist recorded it as a now show. She was very rude to me not recording accurate information.  She myst not want people to know than calls are not returned in 24 hours like it is stated.|Just wanted to leave a review for other people considering this place, whether it is for pain management, addiction treatment (Suboxone) or other wise.

My Doctor was Jana Qualls. Echo is the front desk receptionist.

I have to rave about these ladies. They have exceeded my expectations in everyway. Jana is one of the most compassionate, understanding, accommodating  and smartest doctor I have ever met.

I struggle with addiction, which is why I got to R.H. Quite literally this team is the absolute best place all around I have ever received treatment at. I am actually blown away by Jana. She is amazing and other doctors do not compare. Echo, the front desk lady is also the best. She isn't snarky and seems to really love her job and care about the people who come in through the door.

This is my second year there and I greatly appreciate everyone here and just wanted to put this out there, for anyone who is seeking treatment and on the fence where to go. They will work with you and your insurance.

Thank you so much Restored Horizons and especially Jana Qualls and Echo. These people truly care and wouldn't recommended anyone else, state wide or even in WA.

Thank you and God bless!!!|I have been a patient of dr. Whiting's since 2011 when I came off the streets as a full blown addict originally introduced to him at RCC where he offered ORT. He has ALWAYS listened intently to my views, and medical struggles and has always chosen what was best for me even when I didn't agree at the time. Initially he had me on subs for 9 months in conjunction with SUD, and mental health- wrap around services. I went ""cold turkey"" off the medication as I saw my dependency switch to another and I wanted freedom from the narcotics. A lot of people get confused on the core of the problem and believe a pill will resolve the problems they face. I didn't. I wanted freedom from the bottle and stopped at nothing to get that freedom. I truly worked a program of recovery and completed successfully.
A year later came back to see him because of an injury that has seriously compromised my quality of life and everyday ease of mobility. From the gate, he listened to me. Sent me for the images and the work up needed to substantiate and show me that in fact, I am a chronic pain patient. I fought tooth and nail to be free from the prescription bottle and the absolute last thing I was doing was going back to that helpless, hopeless, momentary living reality of the up and down roller coaster of addiction.
I think where people get messed up is they are looking for one thing, pills to solve there struggles. The pill will only for hours work folks. And dr whiting isn't about upping doses and the medical science he will explain is that less is more. The tolerance is science and the medicine doesn't need to go up, up, up. If this is you, go to the methadone clinic, go see David Robinson in Spokane valley, he specializes in this and it's not the same as pain management. That is substance use disorder and your at the wrong place for that.
Dr whiting has proven over and over to be invested in restoring quality of life with the lowest dosing possible which is different for every patient and yes, with whiting your a patient not a number on a medical invoice. Each patient is given the same opportunity and some just are at the wrong place. Drug addicts won't last in this practice. I'm a recovered drug addict that under dr whiting's care, my quality of life has been restored even through two major surgeries and the likelihood of SUD kicking back in. He did my pain management following both major surgeries and I personally do not entrust that part of my life to anyone but him. He teaches the medical and science behind your spacific medical conditions and seeks to educate his patients and offers many options not just pills. There are many ways to ease pain depending on medical conditions and limitations. Because of dr whiting's support, encouragement, education, and his compassionate heart so long as your here for the right reason he will serve you well.
He deserves the recognition of seeking to improve chronic pain patients quality of life. He is well educated on all fronts. And shares his knowledge, explains what happens in the body and brain with these substances. For those that truly are chronic pain patients and not drug seekers or addicts his practice offers wrap around services to attack your pain physically, mentally, emotionally, as well as chemically (pain meds) he will work with you to meet your own medical goals. Many services are offered right there in his practice.|I have been in pain mgt for 21 years and spanning 4 states. Of all the providers I have seen in that time, I would rank Jana Qualls as one of the top 2 in terms of compassionate bedside manner, responsiveness and expertise of her specialty and the complexities of caring for patients who suffer from chronic pain.

I felt like a 1000 lbs burden was lifted from my shoulders once Jana took over my care and I honestly believe God has shown me some favor by pairing me w a provider who feels more like a coach instead of an adversary. I can't think of enough good things to say about her and I would absolutely recommend her.|this guy is a joke he is unprofessional and dont say anything he doesnt like. he knows your in pain and need your meds so he uses it to his advantage to make you bow down to him and the way he treatd you, i tried saying something to hin on my wifes behalf and he flipped out and starts with the accusations and disrespect. he knows he can do it or he wont give u meds and label you and since his word is god you better behave. my wife died of cancer we used to see him. i wouldnt see this guy.",2024-08-20|2023-01-12|2024-01-21|2023-11-07|2022-10-31|2023-07-22|2023-01-17|2023-11-20,5|5|5|1|5|5|5|1,,,"11 a.m.|10 a.m.|12 p.m.",54.666666666666664|50.666666666666664|49,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ85JIsDnBYVMR8BCTXPHpr-4,29

I can say the staff is nice though. Do not recommend this place at all...|I have been a patient of Dr. Wm. Binegar for a number of years because of severe back pain issues. What has impressed me is his honesty and  candor. He has never promised miracle cures of my pain, just an honest  assessment of the pain relief he has to offer.  I have found him to be a compassionate professional and I am please with the care I have received.  His office staff is efficient, friendly and understanding and make the visit a pleasure. I have referred friends to him and will continue to do so.|I live with constant and frustrating chronic pain (I'm an active 56-year old who loves to walk and hike), and I have found some relief with Dr. B. He listens to me, which is not very common among pain docs, I have found, and we plan a pain-relief strategy together mostly steroid shots as there is not much else to do. I've all but given up on a pain-free life, but at least I get a reprieve on some days.

He's a good doctor, and I recommend him or his new colleague, who is also understanding and willing to try new methods.|My experience at Pain Care Boise was amazing! Dr. Binegar was so kind and took so much time in explaining the steps of the procedure that he performed on my lower back! The staff is exceptional! They went above and beyond to get me scheduled right away, and were all very professional!|Dr. Binegar treated me for almost a year. During this time I given many many injections. When the shots failed to produce good results I was told my only choice was a spinal implant. I liked him and his staff, but giving shots seems to be the only treatment they offer. So in the end it was just too bad for me.|BEWARE! Do not go to this doctor! All he wants is to make money on rejection and monthly return visits! He is not fair or sympathetic!!!! Dr. Binegar will not prescribe the pain medication I need. I have been taking the medication for over one year before moving to Boise and GP referred me to Binegar. He immediately reduced my pain medication and my pain went sky high. His personal policy trumps my degree of pain. I am scheduled for new injections in my neck on 7/20/2020. This may be my last attempt to save my life. He will not debate the issue! He just will say no. I wish HE could live with my pain for just one day. I have tried every back, hip and SI joint injections and got minimal relief in my hip. The relief lasted one day. Same with the second hip injection and many other injections. He could care less about MY PAIN! I strongly suggest you get everything in writing before you visit or undergo any procedure. If he/they do not generate results there will be no charge. I just keep rotating through their system. It's all about money, it's not about helping me! I again, look forward to my upcoming visit and pray I get some relief and he/they will be more reasonable when prescribing pain education. I am in so much pain and I know my body will shut down soon and I I could possibly die! Please help me now before I need to file a complaint with Idaho Board of Physicians. I also want a copy of my bills!

I like the fact that he is direct, get's straight to the point. He doesn't waste my time, I try not to waste his time.  I respect him and value his unique talents, intellect and straightforward manner.  He's polite and often get's down to business quickly.   I see so many doctors, that I greatly appreciate the quickness of my routine appointments. (15 minutes or less)

Keep in mind it takes time to build trust and effective communication - especially when appointments are kept as brief as practical.  It was probably six months before I actually knew that Dr Smith was the right fit for my pain management needs.  I was relieved that isn't intimidated by my complex medical history with multiple rare diagnosis. He simply focussed on what he does best: Providing pain relief options while keeping his patients safe from potential pitfalls.   It's my job to make sure my other doctors are kept in the loop, then make my pain management decisions based on input from all of them.

Dr Smith's is the navigator,  his patients are in the driver's seat.  He answers any odd questions I ask, addresses any concerns I have.  He isn't offended when I question a specific approach or if I decline part or all of his offered treatments.  He also keeps an open mind when I have suggestions.    Dr Smith has a passion for practicing pain management and it shows.  He stays abreast of recent studies, new treatments, changes in practices, etc... He lets's me know when there is a new development  that relates to one of my conditions.

I have recommended him to my close friends and family.

.|I don't typically leave reviews, but I can't in good conscious not leave one. I was recently seen by this provider and left the appointment in quite literally tears. This has never happened to me, and I don't want this to ever happen to anyone else and especially when one is in severe pain. This provider made me feel shamed and made me question advocating for myself. I made it quite clear to this provider that my quality of life has been severely affected, he had physical medical documentation that he went over that showed a bulging disc, arthritis in both the neck and lower back at only 35 years old and this still was not sufficient enough for him to provide me something to manage the pain while I get through physical therapy and other alternative methods to a long term solution in regards to pain. He also made the statement that it sounded like I could have fibromyalgia which most know is painful disorder - as are most auto immune disorders. I'm on the waitlist for every rheumatologist in town. He stated his opinion was ""we aren't quite there yet."" and I didn't need anything more than ibuprofen. I would think my medical history/documentation would take precedence over his opinion and it's truly alarming this provider is working with pain management patients. The quality of care with this provider was non-existent, caused a flare up with my auto immune disorder due to stress, had to take the following day off work and to top it off I paid for this appointment. I've been through x-rays, CT scans, MRI's to finally get to the point of my PCP referring me somewhere to get help for pain, I finally felt a ray of hope with this appointment coming up but instead left worse off than when I went in. It was a dehumanizing experience in a place where one should feel safe, seen, heard, and taken care of considering this is a doctor's office. This has been upsetting on so many different levels for me and will have lasting impact on me and medical appointments moving forward.|I absolutely lobe Dr. Smith! He gave me hope when other pain specialists told me there was nothing wrong from a car accident! And he truly listens and cares! He will take baby steps and try everything possible. It can take a long time to heal but he was very thorough and trying everything possible before jumping to surgery. He was able to get my pain under control and got me the answers I needed to live a pain free happy life.|DR. Smith is one of the best docs I've ever come across. I have been in this pain for over 12 years. He was kind, respectful, informative, and willing to let ME have a say in my own care! Not just push his own agenda down my throat like other docs do.Highly recommend!  Miss him so much!|My wife had brain surgery in 2017. Since then she has experienced nerve pain and severe headaches. She was referred to Dr. Smith in 2021. He tried two medications that our family Dr. hadn't tried. When they didn't work he said there is nothing more I can do for you. This guy is a total ripoff, don't waste your time.|I have been going through numerous pain shots and medication. DEMETRIOS PLOMARITIS, PA-C has been my doctor for awhile. When he joined the team that made me even more inclined to come to Dr. Smith. Dr Smith takes his time to explain things.  He is not a pill pusher and that pills are the answer to it all. He explains all the alternatives before just passing out pills. I would HIGHLY recommend them.|Dr D Smith cares. He takes the time listen
He takes notes and works to find the cure.
If you have pain that is 24/7 please get in to see Dr D. YOU need to take notes and pass them on to Dr D. Listen to him, do you exercises  You work together to find the cause of pain.

I would not have anyone else do the work on my neck or back. I trust him with my life  He is a great and awesome DR.|Very judgemental before I even met him. Extremely disappointed and insulting. Had to wait over a month for him to even review my referral, I had to call, no one ever called me. Impolite front desk read his documentation to me. Dr. Harris documentation was extremely condescending and unhelpful. Pretty much told me to move on. Wonder why he went into the medical profession if he picks and chooses who he wants as a patient. I never even met him, but if that's the way he communicates with patients through his front office, no thanks. He can make his money off someone else.|I've been a patient of Dr. Eli Harris for over a year. I see him for pain management. He was recommended by my primary care physician. If you are looking for a doctor who is easy to talk to and someone who really cares, then this is your man!  I can't say enough good things about him.
I don't want to leave out his staff. The front office-terrific!  They are always pleasant in person or on the phone. And Katie his medical assistant Is one of the sweetest persons you would ever like to meet.
Thanks to Dr Harris, Katie, and staff for helping me on my journey to feeling better.

Linda Brown|The most attentive and committed doctor I have ever had. Chronic pain for 6 years even after multiple surgeries and Dr. Harris is committed. He sees me. He hears me. His ability and willingness to continue thinking outside of the box in comparison to other doctors is truly something that's rare. His willingness to collaborate with other doctors is something I've always thought was missing in the pain management world. Thank you for seeing and hearing me!|The doctor, Eli Harris was great.  Unfortunately he forgot to send in my prescription and it took a couple of calls and a futile visit to my pharmacy before it got cleared up.

As for my appointment, I felt some hope for my pain for the first time in a very long time.  I am hopeful that my next appointment will help my hip and back pain.  Dr. Harris was very informative and most important, he actually listened to me.

I would recommend him to anyone.|It honestly went from 5 stars to 1 stars because of his staff members. The staff members has zero empathy when things go wrong for a patient and is completely frustrated and being lied to.   I'm not going to name names behind, but stay away from his office unless you like to be talked down to by staff members.|First time there, the receptionist was very nice. The wait was way too long and they really should have more comfortable chairs, I mean it is a pain clinic after all. The Doctor was a nice guy and made me feel comfortable. I would recommend them.

Would recommend any other options out there before dealing with these folks.|I couldn't be more fortunate that I found Dr. Whitaker and he was able to finally help relieve my chronic migraine issues.

I had been suffering from migraines every single night when I would lay down to go to sleep for about two months, I had looked for every solution to help my pain acupuncture, chiropractic, pharmaceutical migraine medication and nothing would help. Dr. Whitaker provided trigger point injections that overnight helped my situation and I have been migraine free for about six months now.

The misinformation that was used against me was created by a non related doctor to cover up a mistake made with my treatment. Health professionals that don't verify information usually make problems worse for the patient. To be clear, the information that was used against me is a work of fiction created by a non facility doctor covering up his mistake. One more thing - they sent the devastating report to my regular doctor without examining me.|I have seen two providers in the year I have been receiving care here at first everything was great until several months later when my first provider came in suddenly checking my back talking about my t12 wedge fracture and possible treatment. That confused me as I was under the impression I was receiving treatment for that already but wasn't. It was already to late for that possible treatment through inland imaging. Ended up having an ablation that has reduced pain in a minuet amount but it's not enough. The provider I see now she really listens with concern, empathy, and kindness. I feel like an adult when I see her and not like a misbehaving child that my fist provider made me feel like. Overall this PainClinic has been great Lisa schedules timely appointments, always returns my calls by the next day even if we end up playing phone tag she always tries again, she is friendly, personable and has a beautiful smile on. Madison is a wonderful provider and the doctor who comes out to perform procedures is amazing. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. The only thing I could complain about is trying to call in it's difficult to reach anyone. I suppose that's due to the amount of patients they have and our needs.

Lisa has gone above and beyond in scheduling to make things happen to match my timeline because I work out of town. Extra special kudos to her, she is really on top of her game. Her efficiency and knowledge makes it all run smoothly. Jonathan has explained everything phenomenally and is just a delight. Always upbeat putting in the extra time also making things happen.

Johnathan has great bedside manner and never makes the appointment feel rushed. He listens.
Will always be a patient as needed here. Thanks for quality care!|As a new patient they have been very helpful and will listen to you unlike many other clinics, etc., so far ZERO complaints .|I've gone here a few times after being referred by a NP. I had to argue with the doctor to have anything done as the doctor had felt by looking at images taken years ago, that there should have been no reason why I was having issues.

They do not care about their patients, they only care about making money. I will not be coming back, and I will be finding somewhere else that actually treats people like they should be treated.
Like people.

There is so much more going on here but i feel like it is a doctors office so your experience may vary.
I just don't care for my time and my money to be wasted, and I feel as though people deserve to be treated with respect.

The billing department also willy nilly chooses what to charge, they wait for insurance to pay, then they charge the patient some more after writing off a portion of the bill they no longer care to try to collect from insurance.

Ten outta ten don't go here folks.
Get treated like an actual person and go somewhere that the people working actually care about their patients.

Specifically to the front desk lady working today who needs to get her bias under control and not be such a disrespectful person.

It's a bad image, a bad company, and bad practices.|Jonathan Lippman is the provider I see. He is professional, caring, and most importantly; he listens to what I have to say. I appreciate the efficiency of our appointments. The pain specialty field usually burns out the best providers. Doc Lipmann is the best I've had over the decade I have been treated in this field.|Was literally told, you are better off than most of my other patients. Can you dress yourself? Take a shower? Perform daily functions? Then,  I guess we could try a nerve block and you could try LDN. The mri you had on your back 2 years ago looked great. Then told me the medication I was on wasn't helping me. When indeed it was helping me. Did a trial nerve block and was told several different things by different people that made it confusing. I switched pain management clinics and come to find out I have a disc hitting nerves in my back and chronic costochondritis. My back is not fine and my side has a legit reason for really bad pain.

X-rays over a year ago revealed a bone on bone situation that requires surgery for pain relief & then healing time. I don't have the means of money, time or insurance to help this situation.
I've seen Dr Wirick about this situation & we talked about stem cell therapy could be a route for relief. But insurance doesn't help a natural therapy program.
I received a text about a special he was running & thought well, I'll sign up & see what happens.
It was a PulseWave Therapy. Oh My Goodness a Miracle has happened!!! Literally!!! I went on a Monday, for treatment & with in an hour or less ( I think I was in shock) that intense achy grinding pain was GONE !! I went back  on Thursday for a follow-up & another treatment. And the best part, I don't go back until I begin to feel that pain again. And it was more affordable than a regular doctor office visit & no healing & physical therapy treatment, that is a 6 month out of circulation surgery.
I'm so excited & relieved from that intense pain!!!
I'll be sure to follow-up with my next treatment & how long this process last pain wise. Please don't hesitate if you are considering this PulseWave Treatment. Do it !! U have nothing to lose but pain.
Thank You So Grateful I responded & did this !!!|I have been very pleased with all the services I have been receiving at the Sensor Medica Clinic . Starting with stem cell therapy in my knee.
I was due to have complete knee replacement surgery  when I heard about Sensor Medica Clinic & the  stem cell therapy.
They are friendly ,knowledgeable ,very professional and truly care about their patients.
Thank you all @ Sensor Medica Clinic !|Looking at x-rays of my back, I wondered how I was even walking.  It looked like the disc was gone at L5 and I was dealing with bone on bone. And the constant pain and numbing feelings going down my leg were unbearable.  I wondered how I was gonna continue my life this way.  I was told I was going to need surgery on my back, but that was not an option for me.
When I learned about Dr Wirrick doing stem cell injections, I met with him immediately.  To my surprise, I was quickly financed to get the injections and I couldnt be more pleased with the results.  One month after my injections, I was feeling a lot less pain.  It's been 4 months now and my back feels stronger, healthier, and the pain is gone.|Very poor service in the regenerative department all over a simple phone call. I got a message from Monty, for someone in regards to starting therapy. I messaged them back asking them not to contact my number due to the person no longer being with the number. I wanted to make sure they got my message, so I called them and a rude and impatient lady answered my call. When I told her the persons name who contacted me she said she didn't know who that was and seemed like she didn't care that I didn't want my number (a new number that I got a week ago) associated with them anymore. I mentioned I didn't appreciate how rude she was being and she started freaking out at me. And eventually hung up. Not very happy, blocking any number associated with this company.|I cant say enough good about this awesome place, Sensor Medica!

He is the fourth pain mgmt. physician I have had in my 15 years of chronic back pain. I have been under his care for three years. Since finding him, I am at my highest level of quality of life since beginning my chronic pain journey. He is the most knowledgeable, caring, listening, problem solving, kind, and professional pain mgmt. physician you will ever find.
Dr. Marsh understands that each patient's body chemistry and diagnosis is unique; he does not treat me with a ""one size fits all"" approach.
Dr. Marsh is dedicated to listening to me and understanding my symptoms to provide solutions for reducing pain and identifying potential procedures or long term remedies to continue improving my quality of life. Thank you Dr. Marsh, you are a gift from above!|Review for Dr. Marsh,
In the years I have been with Dr. Marsh he has treated several of my health issues. Neck and back pain
from a motorcycle accident in the 70's and the aches and pains that come with rheumatoid arthritis.
feet, legs and entire body pains.
He has been very attentive, observant, patient, understanding, and compassionate. He also has
researched in detail all of my excruciating pain. He takes the time to talk and listen to my ideas. He has
been able to recommend many different treatments and has done much to help me navigate my pain
through the years.
He has researched pain therapies especially designed for me and provided many alternatives for me to
try. I have improved so much. When I first saw Dr. Marsh I could hardly move and now I am up shopping
on my good days and doing activities I never thought I could ever do again.
Thank you, Dr. Marsh for improving my quality of my life and teaching me pain techniques that will help
me forever.
Finally, after being tossed around from Doctor to Doctor and ignored, I found Dr. Marsh and he came up
with resolutions to help me with my pain.
Thank you for helping me getting back my quality of life|I've been seeing Dr Marsh for over 15 years and he's not a fruitcake or a flake!   He saved my life and I will always be in his debt.  He's not only a good pain doctor but is just a very good doctor to trust for just about anything medical.  He's always been very empathetic and willing to listen to you without bias.  I'm appalled at the negative responses posted here and only can say if you're unhappy with his treatment, you must have other issues other than pain.|Dr Marsh is an excellent doctor, I have been seeing him for nearly ten years and in that time he has always been courteous and respectful. He is one of those rare doctors that will spend the time needed to listen to you, and although he is a specialist, he is always open and patient in his approach to your pain and/or injury with a more synergistic view. As many doctors become more and more specialized and only look at what they specialize in, I feel that he takes the time and has the knowledge to look at at the patient and take a synergistic view. I appreciate too, that he constantly is attending conferences and keeps up on the latest findings,  procedures and techniques and present these new options to his patients--that said, he still listens to his patients and their views, and very supportive of your decisions on how to proceed. He is a rare breed, a very caring and knowledgeable doctor.I simply cannot say enough good things about him, I have the highest respect for him as a doctor and human being. He is quite brilliant yet still very approachable and kind.|My husband has been seeing Dr Marsh for years and now I am as well. Very good Dr. Dr Marsh is smart, listens and seems to me has a sixth sense about my medical issues. He leads you in questions until he can pin point what the problem is. I recommend this Dr highly.|Kind and knowledgeable he will help you achieve your daily goals|Dr. Marsh has been helping me manage my pain in a very professional way for several years. He always is trying help me and I don't mean force drugs on me.
We have a great relationship and I trust his judgment.|Dr. Marsh is a very caring, non judgmental Doctor. He listens well and asks for clarification .  Dr Marsh is non threatening and treats others with respect. I left the office feeling peaceful and with dignity.

It was flawless. I've had a couple done at other clinics and this was by far the least painful, quickest, and most effective.|Each experience is very individual, After reading the 3 reviews I felt that it would be very hard to believe those who are actually ranting against this clinic.  Maybe you had to wait a bit, let me tell you the real reason that pain clinics are different from a regular Dr's office..  As a pain patient I was seeing the same Dr in a Seattle Clinic ""Minor & James"".  I was getting help there until my Dr retired (I was with him since 1995).  Because of the government and what they are doing all clinics including Minor & James kicked ALL pain patients out.  You might notice that there are many ""pain clinic"" opening up now...that is why.  The doctors are overwhelmed and under the gun when helping pain patience.  I read a lot about the pain clinics and I was so scared, most were there to get people off medication and treated patience as if they were Dr shopping and their goal was to get ALL pain patience off of medication.  I didn't know what I would do if I had to deal with those clinics.  Drs. all over would not take pain patience!  There are many patients that have chronic pain and there just isn't a cure put pain medication helps many of us get through the day.  Remember many of us are 70 years old and more, DA, The list is too long to share, there are many chronic pain issues for us; no cure.

The day came when I went to see Dr Ispirescu and his staff.  They took a lot of time looking at my records and the many years I've been in terrible pain.  All the right questions were asked.  Because I had been on the same dose of pain med since 1995 and they help me through each day, they kept me on my retired Dr's program.  I was shocked because from what I read I thought that pain clinics were there to take you off pain medications.  Naturally there are people that are on them for the wrong reasons and they may have to work on other ways to get their pain under control.

Recently during an appointment a women asked me if I would consider giving them my DNA, I said yes.  When I got the results back I was relieved to know that I was not going to become an addict (my DNA is very clear about results)  The other finding was if I say I am in pain I AM IN PAIN.  Then it covered some medication and explained what type would not be good for me and would react against my body (DNA).  I thought that the Dr would benefit knowing what their patients DNA was so they could better plan for them.  I was asked to do another DNA and am still waiting for the results, this one will cover most if not all types of medication and what I should avoid taking.  I thought this pain clinic cared about their patients.

It is up to us to be prepared with question and if possible create a plan that you can work on to help yourself.  Not everything they have tried worked but at least we tried.  I have to live with this pain and I am thankful that this clinic is there for us.  I hope they can continue to work with us without the government scaring them to death or worse closing them down because they do help patients and if they would really benefit by taking pain pills and be respectful of them.  I don't know what I will do (and all other real pain patients) if something would make them close.  Many people would not be able to live because of the pain.

When I see any Dr. I get the Dr's notes, it is helpful to have a record of what was done and said.

Thank you Dr Ispirescu and staff.  I wouldn't want your job, it would be very hard to deal with the variety of patients that come in.  The people that are writing bad reviews apparently have not tried to get a Dr. to take them, there are not any in Sandpoint and all American cities.  We are living in very unsettling times and at 70 years old this trouble is the last thing I thought our government would do to harm us.  The people abusing medication are in the spotlight and the people who NEED the pain medications are being punished along with the doctors.|I can't believe some of these reviews!! Dr. Ispirescu is a rare and amazing  Doctor . Let me start with whats going on in the medical world. People,  everything is changing for legitimate pain patients. The Dr. That I've been seeing for over 8 years who not only was the middle man for all my specialists in Seattle and Oregon, prescribed and managed my pain medications (all per recommendations ,tests and procedures from specialists ) was informed that all patients on long-term opiod pain management had to be referred to a ""pain specialist /clinc"" This is happening all over the U.S.!! There's a staggering number of patients with legitimate pain needing both care and compassion from an already overloaded field looking for help,especially in Idaho and Washington to which the Majority of pain specialists either won't take, or Insist on a ""Forced Reduction"" against your wishes or choice . Stopping most or All opiod therapy completely .which leaves a patient with constant and acute pain helpless, hopeless and looking for help. Dr. Ispirescu from my 1st appointment listened, asked questions was compassionate and understanding. The 1st appt. with any Doctor (Especially one for pain ) will NOT prescribe anything especially opiods as not just a precaution for them but the patient as well (any Dr who does is WRONG unless it's an ER  ) to give time for any tests to come in , read medical records, confer with Your other Doctor(s) etc (he made sure my referring Dr. was still managing my meds in the meantime) a  2nd appointment was made before leaving and that appointment was when we came up with a plan of care . Dr. Ispirescu was even more attentive and amicable our 2nd appt. Not only myself but my Caregiver and friend who goes to ever Dr appt with me , felt not only comfortable and  happy with his bedside manner but his attention and time he spent answering questions . I understand that He is a busy Doctor but as I stated in the beginning he must be getting so many requests for pain patients let alone all the surgical procedures with Back patients not just at the Sandpoint location but at the clinics Washington location as well, in no way have I ever felt rushed by him ( I can't imagine how he has any personal time himself) The entire office staff are Amazing!!! I don't understand the reviewers that claim otherwise Because my experience from phone calls to front desk all the way through to nurse and Nurse Practitioner to Doctor I've had pleasant ,cheery and personable experiences above and beyond. I believe people treat you the way you treat them but still this office and entire staff are nothing but refreshingly personable,  upbeat and accommodating.|It was awful. I was treated like a junkie looking for drugs. No compasion at all for my documented cronic pain condition due to a work related injury. My previous doctor could no longer prescribe for me once I got my referral. It was over a month before I could be seen by Dr. Ispirescue. I was allowed to go for that full time with no pain management. No one could understand why I was upset and less than cheerful having gone so long with no pain management and even less sleep. A woman was sitting outside the building in a wheel chair waiting for a ride. She had received the same. Don't expect an ounce of compassion from this doctor.|Expect to be treated incredibly poorly and unprofessionally if you are even slightly overweight. Your pain will not be treated. What you will receive is a lecture about your weight from a sickly looking vegetarian who looks like he can barely lift a clipboard.

Additionally he'll push a vegetable only diet without apparently understanding that if you are overweight the reason you're overweight is not because you eat too much and have the nerve to eat meat and fat but rather the beta cells in your pancreas can't handle the extremely high amount of sugar and starch which is turned in to sugar during the digestion process. He clearly does not know or understand how and why the body produces fat. Here's a Biology 101 lesson for the doctor and anyone reading: Your body will turn excess sugars in to fat. It does not just plop any fat you eat on to your fat cells. Additionally pushing increased sugar and starch consumption on a fat person is just ordering them to develop diabetes, heart disease, and a host of other related conditions. He'll also mention calories which goes one step further in demonstrating that this doctor didn't pay attention in his chemistry courses. The calorie is a nonsense diet metric as no human literally burns their food. The calorie is a great way to know if a food is good for fire but isn't a worthwhile metric for a system that is powered by acid based chemical reactions that do not involve the ignition of the foodstuffs.

Additionally the staff will forget you are waiting to see him because if you are seeing him at Idaho Pain Clinic's Washington location you are not seeing this doctor in his own office but rather the hospital in Newport, which is deserving of a negative review of its own. If you do manage to be remembered by the terrible staff you're still in for a major wait as they overbook their appointment slots and don't seem capable of handling the workload.

Lastly if this doctor's got ethical or moral issues with treating people with pain relieving medications he should think about switching specialties. The reason patients go to pain clinics is to get their pain taken care of. If it bothers this doctor that his job is to be the gatekeeper to pain relief and can't handle the thought that patients may become addicted to their medication then he really needs to switch jobs. I recommend waste disposal that way he can still have his moral dilemmas which he appears to need and the patients he would see might be able to see a provider that can handle treating chronic pain.

Overall seeing this ""doctor"" was an insulting and aggravating waste of my time. I wish I could bill this joke of a doctor for my time, fuel costs, and the irritation I experienced.|Dr. Ispirescu,  is a wonderful doctor, very caring and shows true compassion for his patients. I would highly recommend him to anyone who may need pain treatment or knowledge he is very good at both. The staff is also excellent ,friendly and professional. He takes time with you and is very prompt.|Had such high hopes for this place.  After suffering with unexplained foot pain for 7 years and trying many meds and procedures, my GP referred me here.  Dr. Ispirescu skimmed my written summary of my symptoms and all the meds and procedures that were tried.  Then he told me I should go to Costco and buy a Vitamix so I could start drinking Smoothies to get enough Omega 3s.  When I asked him if that was what's in Fish Oil, he replied yes.  I then told him I had been supplementing with Fish Oil for over 10 years.  At that point he admitted that the Smoothies probably wouldn't help me.  What?!  He then recommended that I try a new therapy called Anadyne (probably not spelling that right).  I did try that for a week at this clinic with two different PTs who were amazing (and the reason I rated this place one star and not 0 stars).  I felt like this therapy provided some degree of relief.  Because we were moving the next week, I wanted to try to continue this therapy in my new community.  I tried to get a copy of my records to take with me.  I asked several times over the next week and was constantly told the doctor had to ""sign off"" on the records before I could have them.  Finally on the last day I left my new address so that the records could be sent to me.  It is now almost a year later and the records have still not appeared.|Compassionate, knowledgeable. I like Dr. Ispirescu very much. The other pain clinic and surgical staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I'm surprised at the poor reviews given here.

I went from being very active with hiking, Pilates, yoga, strength training and cycling, to barely being able to walk two blocks without a walking stick. In just 4 sessions with Jenny Jones, my knee pain is almost gone and I am becoming more active! I highly recommend Jenny and We Care Wellness! I feel like I have my life back.|Submitted on behalf of my husband, James Jeffery We Care Wellness Patient

When I first came to NuBack in 2019 now known as We Care Wellness, I could not walk without the assistance of a cane, due to a previous work injury in 2014. While awaiting surgery for my knee, my other knee was impacted from my gait. I experienced back, hip and knee pain. I previously went to several doctors, and I was told that I could have a nerve ablation, or lifetime of a medication, neither one was very appealing. As I tried to ease the pain I was feeling, I turned to hydrotherapy at a local gym. There I met a good friend who was in a similar condition. The next time I saw him, he was walking upright. He told me about his experience with and I made an appointment. Before going in, I prayed that I would be okay with what was ultimately God's choice. Whether I was to heal or not, I wanted to be sure that I accepted the results. Then when I entered and began the treatments with the PT team, I was amazed at how much better I felt, I walked out of the first appointment without my cane. Over the course of the past few years, with additional visits strengthening me and making me feel better and better, the program has left me and my family in a tremendously positive light. We Care Wellness physical therapy changed my world and I want to thank them for it. May God who healed me bless them greatly. -James Jeffery|The back therapy I received was very helpful in relieving my cronic lower back pain. After my second session I was able to turn off my back stimulator and keep it off. I also reduced my pain medicine by 50%. The therapy help me strengthen my core muscles and start down a path of less pain allowing me to start activities, like working around the house and in the garden, and enjoy myself. Jenny doesn't believe in ""No pain no gain"" but rather, if you're feeling pain then we need a new aproach. It takes time and effort but in the end it's well worth it.|I injured my back in a mountain climbing accident when I was 22, and had surgery at 28, more than 40 years ago.  I've always enjoyed an active lifestyle, but have had a number of episodes over the years when my back would go ""out"" for 2-3 weeks at a time, unable to walk.  I've tried chiropractic, massage, physical therapy, but nothing gave me lasting results.  The last couple of years, my back pain has escalated to the point of reluctantly spending most of my time reclined, unable to sit upright for long, or enjoy my daily walks.  Last fall I learned about the back program at ""We Care Wellness Center"".  They use traction, low frequency vibration, and gentle exercises to increase spinal disc height and balance by 80%, and increase strength and muscle building by 30%.  The day I started treatment, I could barely walk.  By the time I left that first day, I felt better than I had for years, and walked out nearly pain-free.  Approved by the VA, I have continued the program, and am feeling better and stronger with every treatment.  I have learned exercises and techniques to do at home to avoid much of my back problems.  I am enjoying completing projects, and my daily walks again.  I can honestly say the professionals at ""We Care Wellness Center"" have helped me avoid another surgery, and given me my life back!|Excellent they really care and I actually feel better when I leave.

When I was first referred here, I was struggling because my former pain management clinic had mebon so many different meds a day I couldnt function.  Since day one both the staff and myself have strived to manage my pain and diagnosis with as little med as possible. I love that I always feel welcome when I walk through the door, Tonya always has a smile for me. The nursing staff shows genuine concern for my health and always make sure I am comfortable,  I primarily work with Weldon, who ALWAYS listens to what I have to say, and is an exceptional person. Recently I have gotten to meet with the newest Doc, dr. Becker and he has been equally awesome... Thanks everyone for showing you care|I've got nothing nice to say, about TS&S...so, I'll just give the 1rating, as my experience w/Dr Zoe & Ryan Park towards 'the end', was abysmal.
Am now going to a great clinic, with good folks who listen, and treat folks accordingly to their specific needs.
I hope that you, and yours are doing well. -would this post/comment, be considered (in your infinite wisdom, Tanya) stretching the truth ?- Not into lard...or embellishments, eh ? Of all people, I thought that -you'd- appreciate that. Everybody's gotta make a living, ain't that right?|The only positive thing about this pain management group are the nurses and secretary. For the past three years I have gone to this office I have worked diligently to perfect a proper pain regimen for my problems. I have gone to many specialists on referrals from this clinic and have received dozens of useless injections. After the arrival of the glorified nurse Ryan Park my care went from a stable, ""good as it can be"" quality of life to constant pain at night and into the morning due to him screwing up my regimen.  He also pretends to not be able to count when it comes to him writing your prescriptions so that you go days without pain management. I got treated like a drug seeker all of a sudden. I had three falls due to his incompetence and after his suggestion that I go off my much needed prescription of Xarelto (for multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms and DVTS that could kill me) in order to take NSAIDS instead of my regular pain regimen I decided to call it quits. I have already found a doctor that understands that almost 30 years of injuries and autoimmune diseases should be treated with dignity and proper pain management. Please, please if you are reading this, take it seriously. You are taking your life into your own hands if you decide to go to this clinic. They have no care for the individual or their specific pains. Just the amount of money they can make from the number of useless procedures they can come up with to ""help"" you. This is to say nothing about the way that he falsified my records. Please, if you have gone to this clinic, request a copy of your records and look at them carefully. Be proactive if you have already put your faith in them.|Substandard treatment from dealing with insurance to your personal care Ryan Park is an uncaring individual who cares less about what you say as a patient! It's only about his thoughts that matter he could care less about you never go here!|I've always been treated with respect. My pain concerns have always been addressed and treated adequately.

They take personal information and never call you back. They'll take all your personal info, then have you send in documents and records only to never call you back. Happened twice. They said I sent the records to the wrong department ( which they provide the email address) and had me resend and never called back. This is especially concerning due to the amount  identity theft happening currently within the medical field. Mine and my children's personal information is being sold on the dark web due to a medical breech and this is why I'm extremely hesitant to give such information out so freely.|As I sit here waiting earlier this morning to be seen by My Pain Dr. Todd Hagle,I've been seeing him for the past 12+years. When DR Hagle move I follow him he's the best not only does he sit with you and find out your pain levels, and what can be done he comes up with the solution that you & he agrees on. And my nurse Brittney RN, is always on point not only is she a kind sweet person she cares about your care. She starts my IV without hesitation gets me all the time when I'm talking LOL! And Marisa is another great young lady from the front area who cares about your well being! Their family to me and I love them all. Dr. Hagle thanks for caring and sharing your always thoughtful and loving and is always serious about your patients need. Brittney RN I'll always choose you, you go above and beyond thank you all! My pain level has been under control for some time now!|Dr. Hagle, who had been treating me, prescribed steroids, which my chart says I cannot take. I'm the patient and trusted him instead of checking to be sure he knew what he was doing.  I've been in too much pain to think clearly and I pay him to be the doctor.
I ended up in the ER and a 2 1/2 day stay in the hospital because the steroids messed up by already uncontrollable blood pressure.
When I called his office to tell them what he did, he called me back and insinuated that it was my fault for taking them and falsely claimed I was asked if these were ok.
That is not what happened.  They called me to tell me what he was prescribing and I took them.  Again, HE is the doctor, not me.|2/07/25 Update - I had an appointment today and was a little bummed that Dr. Moten was sick because I had a few questions for him.  Was pleasantly surprised by his aide Steve (I hope that's his name, or is it Scott?), anyway I was blown away by his knowledge. He actually helped me with a couple of answers. I know I wouldn't want to stop seeing Dr. Moten, but would not have a problem at all seeing his aid if he's overbooked.  Kudos to Illinois Pain and Spine. Don't let that one get away. I've been to MANY spine doctors from Northwestern to Advocate to Rush and I can honestly say he's got just as much knowledge and a better bedside manner than some of the so called ""Top"" doctors and nurse practitioners I've seen.

Original post - Love Dr. Moten and his nurse Erica.  Dr. Moten takes the time to understand your situation and your pain.  He is very thorough.  I was at TOP Pain Center in Aurora for 9 years and all that Dr. Chen cared about was money.

The only issue I have with Illinois Pain and Spine is the Elgin office. Two times I've had a medication refill issue and both times it was because of the Elgin location. Both times my medication wasn't called in on time.  This last time I literally had to drive to the Barrington location on a Saturday because the girls in the Elgin office were not relaying the message, not putting importance on the message, I don't know what they were doing, but this is the second time it's happened and both times it's when I've had to deal with this location. I understand that the doctor is extremely busy and may overlook things, but when I call all they say is ""there's a message in there already"". ""I already know the message is there, but I need you to personally talk to the doctor to tell him that he left the message in there and forgot to film my meds"". They don't. I can tell automatically with the attitude I get on the phone that they're not going to give him the message.  Thank Goodness Erica and two other girls helped me on the Saturday when I drove in.  They are very thorough and you can tell they like to take care of the patients.

The Elgin location is closest to me and yet I drive to the Barrington location just because of other issues also.  I always wait so long at the Elgin clinic.  I've stood at the window with girls right in front of me and they've made me stand there and not acknowledge me. Excuse me if I'm interrupting you, but it is your job and how rude you just let me stand there and then give me attitude?  Now I will say it's been months since I've gone to the Elgin location. I was just asked to write a review so I thought I would be as thorough as possible.

I would highly recommend Illinois Pain and Spine I just wouldn't recommend the Elgin location. St Charles and Barrington are good. I've never gone to the Itasca location.|I am happy with my procedures. The most recent procedure we did worked very well. I have been with Dr. Yaccoub for 10+ years. I was out of state for 7 of those years and flew home for my appointments. Steven Perry is very pleasant and helpful. There is another woman I can't recall her name but she was a physicians assistant I think and I liked her too. Different perspectives or recommendations to tweak minor things sometimes have a big difference. There absolutely are some delays in communication in the office, however, they are actively focused on it.  Colleen is always helpful and the best person to speak with if escalation is needed. Thank you!!|Run as fast as you can from  Dr. Hagle, Alley and many staff
Horrible experiences  pain worse after many treatments.  Saw him for a long time hoping I would feel better. Last procedure on my spine/epidural-I chose to be awake for all of them.  This allowed me to be able to tell him immediately that I felt tingling all the way from my shoulder to my fingers.  Then immediately felt hot burning liquid fill my arm and run all the way down to my hand.
That was July 29th. July 30th dr Hagle wrote a letter, certified mail no less dismissing me as a patient. That could not have been a better blessing.  Thank you Dr. Hagle for that.
Sit in the waiting room and you will hear people talk negatively about him and staff. More to follow.

Acute pain comes on suddenly and is often sharp. It's a signal of possible injury or a specific problem and usually lasts briefly, from moments to three months. Chronic pain, on the other hand, lasts longer than expected for healing, beyond three months.

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Diesfeld and the team at Chicago Pain Medicine. For years, I suffered from chronic back pain and saw countless doctors who gave me one wrong diagnosis after another. They were all convinced it was an issue with my L5 lumbar, recommending endless shots, invasive treatments, and even surgery.

But Dr. Diesfeld took the time to truly understand my pain and discovered what no one else did--it wasn't my L5 at all. It was actually my psoas muscle causing the problem. Thanks to his expertise, I didn't have to go through unnecessary surgery, and now I'm feeling so much better!

The care I received here has been exceptional. Dr. Diesfeld's thoroughness, compassion, and ability to get to the root of the problem have been life-changing. If you've been stuck with the wrong diagnosis and ineffective treatments like I was, do yourself a favor and make an appointment here.|Male Dr. Very professional and concerned for patients. Front desk is another story. Only professional employee I've witnessed/worked with handles the pre authorizations. The other females at the reception desk don't even know how to utilize a greeting and say, ""Hi,how can I help you?"" Nothing! Meanwhile having a snack and drinking their coffee. I have to initiate why I'm there and then they respond. No manners, no customer service skills. They need training.|Omg they gave me a shot in my tail bone and the pain in my back is gone.

I can't say enough good things about him as a doctor and a nice person in general.|Dr Louis is the greatest. He cares about all his patients. He listens to all my concerns and treat me like he would his own family. Thank you so much Doc|My experience with Dr. Demetrios Louis at Innovative Pain Specialists started out slow. Twelve years ago I had major surgery on my back that included titanium rods. As I age, I am beginning to have some issues with pain at the top and bottom of the stabilized area of my spine. My GP recommended this practice for treatment. On my first visit, I felt like my concerns weren't heard, but Dr. Louis suggested an injection to relieve inflammation and pain before I left on an overseas vacation, along with some medication to help with the pain. The injection worked enough to get relief for about three weeks. My body could not handle the side effects from the meds. On my follow up visit, I took all of my MRI's and X-rays from my previous doctors. At that time, Dr. Louis took a lot more time to review and discuss my condition. He asked me to have an MRI done on the thoracic spine area. I followed through with that procedure immediately. I met with him to review those findings and was treated with concern and respect for my both eastern and western medical/health beliefs. Together we came up with a plan of treatment steps that we both agreed with, and I am cautiously optimistic that I will get some long-term relief. The moral of my story: go in with as much information as you can, stay true to your beliefs, but be open to new treatments. I highly recommend Dr. Louis and his staff. They truly care about giving you the best and least intrusive care possible.|Dr.Louis and staff is a good place to go if you're having physical problems for pain and discomfort on any part of the body, he has help me in relieving my chronic pain.  I highly recommend him to all with body pain he has patience with you and he listen and respond to your needs..

I've been a patient for 8 years. Dr. Dallas and PA Steve who have overseen my care, are both knowledgable professionals who display a rare compassion for their patients and practice a collaborative approach to care. As a patient, you feel part of a team and your voice is truly heard when forming your treatment plan and next steps. They are also just good people you can trust.|If I could give the 0 stars I would. They sent me for test and used a pharmacy not approved by my insurance. When I called to tell them they said "" oh your prescription is on the way "", which was a lie. Don't count on bedside manner from anyone there. Ugh should have made an appointment somewhere else. This is why they were the only place that had openings! Ugh|I was a returning patient and was very to be able to return to the practice and see Dr Yacoub. He is very thorough and takes as much time as necessary to do a thorough exam And then develope a treatment plan that both Dr Yacoub and I felt would work best.|Dr. Hagle is the best pain doctor I've ever had. He is patient , understanding and compassionate. I must also mention RN Brittany, the nurse anesthetist. She is absolutely amazing at what she does and has a warm, comforting and knowledgeable presence. In addition to Dr. Hagle and Brittany, I would like to commend Kate, the medical assistant. She is just wonderful, whether she's rooming patients or working with insurance companies. I just can't say enough about these people. I would be lost without them. Thank you, Illinois Pain & Spine!  Also sending love and praise to Alli and Miranda!!|I would give this place zero stars if possible. First, horrible process of trying to schedule an appt or make any changes - you can not direct contact any office, you have to go thru a general line and if you're lucky, they will maybe connect you to the right office.  Second, they won't give you an exact time for an injection appoint until three days before when they call. And for me, who needed a driver for my appt, that meant not knowing and not being able to tell my job that I needed time off until three days before.  They did the same for my follow up and then never called me with an appt time!
Third, when I went in for my second shot, the nurse was awful. Three different times, she had the wrong info for me and kept trying to prep me for a shot in my knees when I was getting one in my back. The last time I had to correct her, she had me set up on the table and was mad I was wearing long pants. When I asked why she said ""because we can't give you a shot in your knees with these pants"". I finally yelled ""it's going in my back"". Dr Moten was in the room at this time and just laughed.
Fourth, my last shot appt was set for 12:10- I had asked for a later time but they said they had none. I had to take off work for this and when I got there, the nurse took me back for my vitals and said ""I'm just going to take vitals and then you will go back to the waiting room as Doc needs to eat his lunch. He gets crabby if he doesn't it"". I completely understand that but then don't book appointments for lunchtime! I waited almost another hour before being brought back for my shot. So disrespectful of my time and my job.
I would not recommend this place to ANYONE|I would recommend you if I were through with my treatment--when I would know if it is successive.
So far, I have no complaints.  Everyone has been kind and considerate and efficient.|Very nice staff and nurses. Dr  needs to work on his smile and interacting with patients more. Also, they need to work more on getting to the patients appointment times better. I really enjoy the Illinois pain and spine institute|Dr Hagel and his staff are great.

I come in and do the EKG or whatever the shock/nerve test is. The man that did that was amazing btw! Afterwards I meet with the pain doctor who spend the entire 30 minutes reviewing everything to offer me not a treatment plan of any type besides steroid shots that I've already had done and have a bad reaction to. She wanted me to switch my PT and all my treatment beside surgery essentially to them and feel like her lack effort to produce of a treatment plan past steroid shots. Not a single pharmaceutical was offered besides said shots. This place is a joke and save money, time, and hopes. Tomorrow I will be filing a complaint w my insurance and w their company although I doubt it'll get past the email. Hopefully this helps someone!|My mom is coming here injections and physical therapy for her arthritic knee. She received 6 injections and many pt sessions. Two months later her knee is just as bad or worse.|I came here with  pain in my lower back in beginning of January. Before, I was getting steroid shut once a year from different doctor. The doctor that I was seeing at rhis clinic ordered a fresh MRI and ExRay, and said  that will request my medical records from doctor's office Wich I was seeing Before.  At the beginning of March I  did  my MRI. I called for appointment for May,  because my back pain was suddenly gone. So I  come to my  May appointment, expecting they'll have my medical records and MRI, I  can just get my shut and move on. Well they didn't have any of my records and images.  Long  story short: 5 appointments,  three of them with a doctor  and no medical help.  Even after I provided them  MRI images.  Would not advise to anybody. All what they do according my reviews is prescribed opiods and don't try to help people who is trying to manage their pain without addictive drugs!  Very  disappointed in their professionalism.!|I have been coming here for over a year now.  Dr. Osaben does my shots in my knee and is amazing.  It never hurts and when he's done I could just about dance out.  I highly recommend this place if you have knee problems.  The Physical Therapy group is great to, they are so friendly. And care how you are feeling.  The front desk girls are very friendly when you come in and don't give you grief if you need to reschedule.
I will be looking into other things there, as they don't just do knees,  they do a wide variety of things.
Thank You, for making me feel better!

I was used to just being adjusted. Not ever realizing my body was being traumatized by how they would just force my body one way or another.  But this Dr. He put me on a table that moved and stretched my body I could hear a few pops here and there , but he keep on stretching my lower back and my hips. When that was done then he did the adjustment, it was the smoothest adjustment I have ever had. I walked out of there feeling pretty good. My old Dr used to tell me well you will either love me tomorrow or hate me. If you hate me call and I will fit you in. I don't think with the way they do it here it will ever be that way again for me.|I have been going to RPM for over 1 year.  My neuropathy in my feet has been greatly diminished.

I have been going everywhere to get relief. Didn't think it was gonna be possible. Dr. Khan and his team kept trying different ideas and the stimulator resolved was really good after the second day four days with no foot pain not once I really couldn't believe it, so I didn't know what to do. I slept three days in a row that was the first time in year and I just wanna say thank you can't believe that so far things are working out so very grateful.|I've been a patient for several years, and I can't say enough nice things about them. The staff is amazing! They are passionate, nice, pleasant and so accommodating. My doctor is a rock star, and Dawn is awesome!

In a world where healthcare organizations are poorly, run, mismanaged, money-grabbing machines, this organization is among the worst.

Dr. is interested in billing only. Not listening to patients. My wife had the worst experience with Dr. Racik of any Doctor in her decade plus pursuit of solutions to her chronic pain condition.

The doctor is impossible to get a hold of. There's no internal communication. You call and they don't answer. You leave a message and they don't call you back. Expect to call five or more times before you receive a response, and the person that responds to you will not have listened to your voicemail or any of your emails and will act like you've never communicated with them.

They miss over bill every appointment. My wife paid 50% higher co-pays than she was actually supposed to for months. When that came to light, the overbilling was never resolved or refunded.

After months of trying to reconcile billing discrepancies, there still is no resolution. They act like we've never communicated with them.

The only way to get them to respond is to post a negative Google review, at which point you will receive a prompt phone call where they implore you to take down the review, and in turn, they can resolve your problems.

You can see the attached image they billed us twice for the same procedure, they billed us a third time for the same procedure, which was actually an office visit with the device rep, never even seen by the doctor.

Proceeded with caution, everything about this organization screams scam and insurance fraud.|In the beginning it was ok but as time went on it seemed like they only wanted to treat me if I agreed to some kind of medication. I informed them from the start that I only wanted to use physical therapy and topical treatment. Every appointment they pushed shots and when I said no and I'm not changing my mind they discharged me. The physical therapy was working and I was happy with the results. Not only that but every appointment I'd have to wait 20 to 25 mins to be sent to a room and an extra 10mins to be seen after my appointment time. I came late once and they told me I'd have to reschedule because I was late. I informed them that I will no longer wait after my appointment time to be seen. They were really rude about what i had said, not speaking in English any longer.|Review for Dr. Kang at MAPS Midwest Anesthesia and Pain Specialists

I can't express enough how life-changing my experience with Dr. Kang has been! I was suffering from severe vein disease, with swelling so extreme that my feet were constantly ballooned--I couldn't even see my ankles. On top of that, I was battling constant fatigue that affected my everyday life.

Dr. Kang came highly recommended, and now I understand why. From the very first appointment, he was attentive, knowledgeable, and compassionate. He took the time to explain the root cause of my symptoms and the best course of action. He performed a vein ablation procedure, and the results have been nothing short of remarkable.

Since the procedure, my swelling has completely gone down--I no longer have ""cankles,"" and my feet and ankles look normal again! But the most important change has been how much my overall quality of life has improved. I feel energized, my circulation has increased tremendously, and I no longer feel weighed down by constant fatigue.

Dr. Kang is truly the best of the best in his field. His expertise, combined with his genuine care for his patients, sets him apart. If you're struggling with vein issues or pain, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kang and the incredible team at Midwest Anesthesia and Pain Specialists (MAPS). He gave me back a sense of normalcy I didn't think was possible.

Thank you, Dr. Kang--you're a game-changer!|I recently saw Dr. Pooja Shah at MAPS Centers for Pain Control in Des Plaines for my neck and back pain, and she was wonderful. She took the time to listen to my concerns and provided the care and support I needed. Her compassionate approach and attention to detail made a significant difference in my treatment. Highly recommend her!|Initially when I walked in I asked God to please help me and refer me to a healthcare professional that would apply empathy and provide solution. The receptionist assisted me with paperwork and explained in details. I was in so much pain, she gave me time to fill out my paperwork, politely assisted when I asked.
Then I met PA David Gilbert, He applied his work ethics, listened, showed empathy, assessed my pain level, Range of motion and offered various treatment plans for my pain without asking him. He didn't stop there, he offered me treatment supplies like pain patch and relaxant pill. I almost wanted to hug him because I ran out of funds to get medication. I found a health personnel that did not spend 5 minutes or read previous doctors documentation to assess my situation. I ran out of supplies and my muscle pain increased so I felt hopeless. I slept well that night and the next day I had my patch on. PA David thank you for gracing your profession, I believe with you my healing is near. most patient out there would give anything to find a PA/Doctor like you. Thank you|If only I could give zero stars, I would.

Let me take you through a journey with MAPS. It started in 2022 when I was trying to get an appointment. Filling out the appointment inquiry form and following up with phone calls for years, and I never got in touch with someone - until 2024. I wish I never pursued it.

I'm a 37-year-old woman and working mom of three little girls. I cannot walk or stand for minutes without a cane or walker. I have to use a wheelchair for any distance. And with the use of these devices, I'm in intense pain. At the time, I was also coming off a medication Dr. Racik gave me with horrible, scary side effects of not only pain & illness but mental distress. At my appointment that my mom attended with me, Dr. Racik told me that I was lucky I didn't have cancer or that I wasn't an amputee in regards to my debilitating pain. I can't express what a disgustingly insensitive - not to mention potentially dangerous - comment that was, and coming from a ""pain specialist."" I put it in quotes because Racik did nothing to help, only harm me through interventions that made me worse.

After being told a spinal cord stimulator would be a great option, despite my hesitations, I went in with a hopeful, positive attitude. Based on my history of issues after interventions and based on my history of not being able to get in touch with the doctor, I made absolutely certain with Dr. Racik that I would be able to get in touch with him after the procedure.

See email below for how it went:

1. I had the spinal cord stimulator trial placed on Monday. When I arrived, they asked when my follow up appointment was and that that appointment should have been scheduled at the time that my trial was scheduled. No one ever told me about this. They said at the surgical center this appointment would occur downstairs in an office visit and that they would have it scheduled before I left the building from my trial.

2. After the procedure, I was told Dr. Racik would be speaking with me. That never happened. I was also told Dr. Racik would call me to follow up the next day. That never happened.

3. When a nurse called the following day, she asked how I was doing, and I told her not well. She suggested I take Motrin, which is completely useless. I asked her when the doctor would be calling me to discuss my concerns, she said by the end of day. That never happened.

4. The nurse also asked when my follow up was scheduled. I said it was never scheduled, I had no idea where or how to schedule this appointment - she directed me to the number on my post-op instructions -which, by the way, the instructions say you can bathe after the procedure, which is NOT correct. Apparently the number she directed me to call to make this appointment from the paperwork was wrong as well.

5. I had called and left messages at the number listed on my post-op instructions. I called 8 times in two days and left at least 3-4 messages with no answer.

6. Someone from MAPS just called and said this was NOT the number to call to schedule the appointment, that this appointment needed to be scheduled at the surgical center.

I'm beyond lost, confused, and irritated, to say the least. This is NOT the first time I have had communication issues with this office.

Then - when they did reach out to me finally, it seems no one looks at or takes notes because she asked me to come into the office that day for a leed removal. If anyone knew what was going on, they would know I had my spinal cord stimulator trial on Monday and would be coming in the following Monday for the removal.

This is the pattern of confused communication that has alarmed me the entire time I was unfortunately a patient there.

Finally, I have been trying tirelessly since June-July 2024 to have a billing issue resolved. Their incompetency was infuriating. Now in September, I received a statement - and nothing has changed. Nothing was resolved. I will follow-up with part 2 with those details.|Can't say enough good things about my experience!!! Very professional and courteous. Listened to all of my questions and concerns and addressed everything very thoroughly. Couldn't be more pleased|Thank you so much for your professional and wery sensitive way to help me, when catastrophe struck.
I will always recommend your clinic.

No matter who you deal with they are very compassionate and try to accommodate the best they can.  Whether they treat me with nerve blocks, acupuncture  or various types of medication it was always excellent care. Did the meds always work no but at least they tried. I'm so very grateful to have such an outstanding clinic to help me. No matter who you deal with they are great and very empathetic to your needs. In my opinion you can't go wrong.  As a matter of fact I saw Dr. Li today and he was superb.|Way better than Dr. Nazhi, who's to worried about labeling pts. and not listening to their pain issues. Thank goodness for Nick, Ty and Dr. Li.|Highly disappointed with this place. The office has a doctor's name on the front door, but no doctor sees patients at the office. Instead, there is a nurse practitioner and a nurse assistant. On my first visit, I was diagnosed by the nurse practitioner. After that, all visits were with the nurse assistant. Had I been using my common sense, I would have ended it after the 2nd visit. I don't care how good the nurse practitioner is, he is not a doctor. I want to be diagnosed by a licensed doctor. The doctor whose name is on the front door actually practices at their affiliated surgery center on Ireland Grove Rd. It seems that's all he does; performs procedures on patients lined up by the nurse practitioner and nurse assistant. So after two failed procedures, I was out $2,000 (out of pocket after insurance) with no relief for my pain. About 8 months later, they told me that there was really nothing they could do for me but scheduled another appointment 3 months later to ""monitor"" me. The final straw was when they asked me for urine for a drug test. Their office has never given me any narcotics for pain; I had to rely on my general practitioner for that. They claimed that they do that with all patients. They have signs all over the place and I really got the feeling like I was being treated like a seeker. My common sense finally kicked in and I said enough. Just my opinion here, but it really seems like this doctor has quite a sweet setup; he doesn't have to deal with patients that aren't under anesthesia and performs expensive procedures all day. With that, I would suggest you go elsewhere for relief. This group doesn't have the depth of experience nor professional training to adequately deal with all patient needs.|If you have a pain problem, this is the place to go!  having chronic back and knee problems finding Applied Pain was a game changer.  Between Dr. Ji Li and his staff I've been able to get my pain under control. Can't say enough good things about Applied Pain.  Doctors are exceptional and the staff is fantastic.  They've always kind and helpful. As I said in the beginning of this review, if you have a pain problem this is the place to go,  You won't be disappointed,|Applied pain has been great. I have been dealing with back pain since my last child birth and multiple visits to mclean county orthopedic and no relief. Dr li and nick have gone well above and beyond to help me get injections and possible disabilities that I never expected to have at 36. I would suggest anyone to get a 2nd opinion in town instead of being pushed off to Chicago clinics|$500 out of pocket,  being put under twice and am worse than I ever was before! What was even the point! Then when I'm voicing my frustrations I'm told to leave as a staff member grabbed my shoulder! This is 3 doctors that run a chop shop service ! They prescribe treatment after treatment to pad the bill amd then embarrass you in the lobby for payment!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! There is no outside agency to keep this on the up and up!

Thank you all very much.|I've been a patient at the Rush University Pain Center for about 25 years now; primarily seeing Dr. Sandeep Amin in the last 20. I have a complex history with a post-surgical pain syndrome along with a chronic autoimmune disease causing additional pain in multiple areas. Over the years, we've tried a variety of surgical approaches: outpatient or inpatient; one-time injections, indwelling flows of IV meds, nerve stimulators plus many oral medicinal cocktails. The Pain Center, within the University, has all types of diagnostic tools available as well: lab samples, X-rays, C-T & MRI scans. You are presented with the latest knowledge on your illnesses through residents & fellows specializing in pain management & anesthesia; you may also be offered participation in research studies if appropriate. As you can see, patients are well cared for in this facility with doctors & nurses dedicated to your diagnosis, medicinal & surgical treatments, along with frequent follow-up appointments. Anyone with moderate to severe chronic pain needs a pain specialist as an adjunct physician. It's a very supportive environment to help you through the recurrent traumas of chronic pain management. I cannot say enough about the positive attributes of Dr. Amin & his staff. Overall, I highly recommend the Rush Pain Center! Thank you so much for caring for me over these very many years!!|The physicians and residents are attentive, extremely resourceful, and seemed genuinely concerned with my well-being.

I'm so glad I did! From the initial consultation, Dr. Dabah was thorough in explaining the condition and the treatment options available. They crafted a personalized plan that included adjustments and therapies aimed at relieving pressure on my wrists and improving mobility. Over time, I've noticed a big reduction in pain and numbness, and I'm finally getting some relief after months of discomfort. The office environment is welcoming, and the staff is always professional and attentive. I highly recommend Dr. Dabah to anyone struggling with carpal tunnel. It's made a huge difference in my daily life!
I can now say that I can go back to my knitting and make more blankets for my grandbaby. ""|Delia is Simply the Best!

Delia is an absolute gem at Pain Therapy Associates! From the moment I walked in, she made me feel valued and at ease. Her warmth, professionalism, and genuine care for patients truly set her apart. She takes the time to listen, ensures every detail is handled with precision, and goes above and beyond to make each visit smooth and stress-free.

It's rare to find someone as compassionate and dedicated as Delia--her positive energy is contagious, and she makes a real difference in the patient experience. If you're looking for exceptional care, look no further. Pain Therapy Associates is lucky to have her, and so are the patients who get to experience her kindness and expertise firsthand. Thank you, Delia!|My pain started about 7 months ago and it has been a nightmare. (I will spare you the details) I have seen many doctors and specialists and NO ONE, I repeat NO ONE has been as good of a listener,  effective, responsive, and compassionate as Yuri Kuklov. He has really helped me through one of the darkest times of my life.  Whenever I present a new problem, he always has a quick answer to help me get through it. He is open minded and takes a lot of pride in his work. I really appreciate you, Yuri!|I had a great experience at Pain therapy associates.

I am still working on getting stronger, and I'm essentially pain free.|So far disappointed.  It's been 18 days and today my sciatica pain was worse then before the surgery. I hope it improves. Dr Dabah said we need 5-6 weeks to fully recover so need more time. Their follow up has been excellent.|My husband and I have been patients of Pain Therapy Associates for many years. I would have to say that most of the time,  we are treated well, our concerns are addressed and our issues are resolved.  We certainly would not remain as patients if that were not true.  However, it does seem that oftentimes, communication which is key, breaks down, and we are left without answers that we have been told we would receive.  I have even allowed a few days more, waiting for a return phone call, about my  MRI results, and I am still waiting and in pain and numbness.  That leaves me feeling frustrated. Other than that, the nurses, receptionists, have always been extremely polite and very kind to us, thank you for that!

If I could give this doctor zero stars, I would have.

When Kondelis walked in, he didn't introduce himself and seemed to know NOTHING about me, even though my medical records were sent to him 2-3 weeks prior. He has NO people skills.

Kondelis, right off the bat, said that because I'm prescribed a particular medicine, he would not give me ANY kind of narcotic. Even after I offered to stop taking that prescription, he wouldn't budge....even though I have been living with severe fibromyalgia for over 20 years, AND just had back surgery.

He would NOT do ANYTHING to help me. He encouraged me to go off ALL my medications as a ""reset"".

Kondelis told me my fibromyalgia should be handled by my psychiatrist. Because, you know, the constant, chronic, excruciating pain I feel EVERY DAY, is all in my head.

He was at least 30 minutes late for my appointment.

Kondelis had someone listening in to our conversation and transcribing it WHILE WE TALKED! And, he never asked for my permission. Can you say HIPPA violation?

He was cold and impersonal, except to tell me how his niece is ""paralyzed"" by her fibromyalgia, but yet managed to get her master's degree. So, I told him that I had my master's degree too - what does that have to do with ANYTHING???!?

Going to Dr. Kondelis was a complete waste of my time and money.|I started going to Dr. kondelis when I hurt my back at work.

He's been diligent in keeping me more comfortable until I get surgery for 2 ruptured lumbar discs with severe right leg sciatica. Nerve pain can be tricky to keep under control but I've had much better results with him than several other pain doctors. Very professional, straightforward demeanor but is also compassionate. A radio-frequency heat ablation procedure done in his office was surprisingly easy under his care.
Dr. Rock, who I've seen years ago at another location, has a very gentle, laid back and amiable bedside manner, thoroughly explains treatment options and addresses questions and concerns with reassuring patience. Definitely recommend for effective pain relief options.|My husband and I both see Dr. Rock.  He is interested in what is going on with both of us, makes recommendations based on what we are dealing with, but most important of all, he allows us to make the decisions on WHAT we want done.  We have discussed surgery, but I am not at a point for that right now, and Dr. Rock along with his staff understand that and do NOT pressure me to move forward with that, but rather treat me as I am right now.  They are all friendly, compassionate, understanding, caring, and attentive.  Other reviews keep talking about them not answering the phone - LEAVE A MESSAGE!  They have always returned my calls, they text and communicate with me, there is not a problem here.  If you are dealing with pain, let Dr. Rock work with you.  He has been a Godsend to both of us.|Dr Rock assessed my pain situation and had some interesting assumptions about my status.  I was impressed to Not hear ""the same old dog and pony"" analysis.
He recommended a treatment plan with logic that made sense and was not invasive or surgical. I liked this approach.
Post treatment I am very relieved! He is a master of his craft, a true diamond physician for pain management. Thank you Dr Rock :-)|Horrible. I have new insurance so I called them to make sure they take the insurance. They said they do. I made an appointment for my neck and back pain. Their policy is if the appointment is cancelled it's a 200.00 charge. But it was ok that they cancelled my appointment the day of. So Do I get $200 for them cancelling the appoint the day of? I rescheduled my appointment a little over a week later. No problem. My appointment was made for 10-10-24. The receptionist called me and asked if I could come an hour early.  I said no problem as I do not live far. I get there 15min early give them my insurance card and they say they don't take my insurance. Mind you they had two weeks to tell me this. Horrible practice and horrible follow up. Would definitely not recommend this practice.|Apt. mixup, but helpful staff. Each member I saw was polite, informed and helpful. Dr. Rock struck me as that one-in-a-million. Truly immersed in everything he does. Doesn't stop until he knows everything available.|For over 30 years, I have had debilitating chronic pain. The pain was so bad that I could not sit nor stand for more than 15 minutes.  The pain was excruciating so I could not go out to dinner or a movie because I can't sit that long.
I used to be very active. I skied, played tennis and other sports.
As I got older the pain got so bad I could not function. The pain was excruciating. In 30 years of pain, I've seen at least 50 doctors. I also was seen by doctors at Mayo clinic, Northwestern hospital and University of Chicago.
None of these doctors were able to significantly reduce my pain.
Then I found Dr. Michael Rock.
I consider Dr. Rock the best doctor. He is caring and empathic. He helped reduce my pain significantly and there are days I have no pain.

Because of Dr. Rock, I am able to get out of my house. I now can sit and stand long periods of time
so I can now be active again and do many activities that I could not tolerate before.

Unprofessional.  Control Freak.  Narco-Phobic.  Paranoid.  Makes it up as she goes along.  Profits before Patients.  Can't keep staff employed there for more than 90 days - new voices everytime I called in.  Currently being investigated by Insurance Co. for Alleged Fraud, Waste & Abuse.

Dr Hui has always worked with me and helped me deal with my pain based on my needs and what I can tolerate. She has always been compassionate and treated me like my pain matters to her. Her staff is amazing as well. I would recommend her to everyone who needs pain relief. Shes informative and always looking to do whats best for me. Thank you Dr Hui and staff you all set the example for treating people with chronic pain. I will never go anywhere else.|I have been with Dr Caner for many years now and he has literally given me my life back.  I came to him at a point when I had very little quality of life after many years of dr visits with many specialists with no results.  Dr Caner took the time to work through everything possible to get me back to a place where I could not only function again, but also understand how I was doing it.  Everyone in that office is incredible and I highly recommend Dr Caner and Dr Hui, they will give you every bit of their effort to make sure you get the best care possible, I have never received anything less.|Dr. Caner and staff are the best!! I have been coming to Prairie Shore since 2011. I have had 65 surgeries and procedures and this clinic understands pain.
I have never felt so cared for at a pain clinic. As many know, some pain Doctors do not listen to their patients. This is NOT THE CASE WITH DR. CANER!! Awesome person and Doctor!!!!|I saw Dr. Mehta yesterday for a SLAP tear in my shoulder. Dr. Mehta spent enough time with me. He gave me a shot of cortisone. He said I should benifit from the injection in a couple days or so. I'm waiting for some relief. This is a clean pain clinic with plenty of parking. Dr. Mehta is an outstanding doctor.|Unfortunately I have had to see a Pain Management doctor for years.  I fell 3 stories and also went through Cancer.  With that in mind, Dr. Caner and his staff are by far the MOST HELPFUL, PROFESSIONAL, FRIENDLY & CARING, people that I have had the PLEASURE of getting to know.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Caner if you are seriously interested in finding solutions to your problem(s).  I have had the misfortune, in the past, of going to clinics that just wanted to give you a prescription and send you on your way!  That is NOT a SOLUTION!  It is just a bandage at best!
AGAIN if you are TRULY interested in the most recent techniques to help your issue DR. CANER is the doctor you NEED to see!!  I have done better with him and am currently able to do more now than I have in a decade!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place & staff!!|Dr Caner and his staff, along with Dr. Hui are all true professionals. I have been a patient here for aprox 10 yrs. I am able to endure a livable life due to Dr. Caner's caring methods.. He explains methods for me to minimize pain without resorting to surgery. He listens without one hand on the door. His staff always goes above and beyond. Karen is a miracle worker with HMO's. I don't have a long wait for appts. I am very happy with this doctor. I understand he isn't seeing new pts. at this time from reading other reviews so I would make sure not to lose my place in line.

After I had a right hip X-ray, Dr. Cheema recommended a hydrocortisone injection. A couple hours later, I could feel the effects of the injection working. Some of the pain was relieved. The following day 90% of the pain was gone. Now I have no pain in my right hip. Dr. Cheema is an experienced pain doctor.

The doctors and staff have always been caring and made me feel comfortable. They always listen and explain everything to me.I could not ask for a more professional doctors office. Everyone I have referred to them all had the same outlook and pleasant experiences. I can comfortably say I highly recommend the Chicago pain and wellness group.|I've been a patient of Dr. BelMonte since my first cervical surgery back in 2013. Even with my insurance changing, I have stayed with him because of his compassionate to help me through my severe pain from my 3 cervical surgeries. He has been the best pain doctor I have dealt with. Thank you Dr. BelMonte for everything you do!

I went to see Dr. Lee since I've been in severe depression from my last cervical surgery for last 2 years. This new treatment was something I was hesitant to do but it got me out of my bad rut and was starting to see things more clearly. Because I didn't know what to expect, I fought with the first experience but noticed I was actually feeling a little bit better after the first session and has been improving ever session. This was a unbelievably amazing experience for me. Another thing I noticed was that my mind stopped racing which has made me more calm since Ive always been so tense.  Thank you Dr. Lee for introducing me back to life again!|Dr. Lee, and her entire staff, have been nothing short of amazing in the year that I have been a patient. The service is so personalized.  Dr. Lee asks me about my daughter and family every time I see her, and her compassionate bedside manner makes me so comfortable. Medical assistants Jake and Bri are top notch, and it is evident that they love working in this office, which says so much about the leadership and culture of this practice. I cannot recommend them highly enough!|I have been seeing Dr. Belmonte over 3 years-- with considerable success in managing the variety of areas injured and stressed out by a 40 year Nursing career.
This physician is kind & competent -- I trust him implicitly.
His skill has allowed me to practice professionally for a few more years-- rather than face a forced retirement.
Anesthesiologist Dr Lee is wonderful-- caring & very careful in sedation practices-- I do not think I would have been able to tolerate many of the procedures I needed to have without her expertise.
I highly recommend this pain management center -- well run & delightful staff throughout!!!|Thankful for the staff to walk me through the IV Hydration process. It was fast and simple. Definitely will recommend to someone who is interested. Flora was gentle and caring. I went on Monday and I recommend her.|I highly recommend Dr. Joseph Belmonte & Chicago Pain & Wellness Institute!!! He has been my doctor for over 4 years before he even had his own practice.  I can't say enough good things about him. I have chronic pain from an extremely bad car accident. If it wasn't for him, I don't know what I would do. He is a very compassionate, comforting, concerned, perfect bedside manner of a doctor, which is hard to come by these days. If someone doesn't have pain, they don't have a clue. Dr. Belmonte helps get to the root of your problem. He takes his time with you. I have never once felt rushed in the office by him. He has done many procedures on my back, which I landed up needing a spinal cord stimulator in. That has helped me so much thanks to him! His partner, Dr. Lee is also absolutely wonderful. She also is very kind, sweet, concerned, and a wonderful bedside manner.  The nurses there are fantastic! They are always  so friendly and asking how you are and your family, not like you are just another number or patient.

After it the doctor assistant girl was a very professional & she was experienced nurse.
After it Dr yaqub came to examine me around 15 minutes & he opened several options for pain solutions. I asked him to suggest me the best option from his experience. He said go for blood test & cicatrix test first. Let me get the reports. After it i suggest you the best solutions. Next day i gave my blood for test. Monday i have my appointment with cicatrix.
After i will submit my new appointment for the my pain solutions.
The bottom line is this office is fully equipped for pain management. Let me see the results. Then I will talk further..

Yaacoub has an excellent presence with his patients, truly listening to them and understanding their lifestyle. There's no question Dr. Yaacoub wants the best outcomes for his patients, which means trial and error -- due to his patience and thorough detail, this isn't an issue. His man goal is to get you out of pain for good, not just mask it with prescriptions. He helped with my SI joint/lower back pain through injection. I received sedation before and do not remember a thing -- other than the pain I was in -- I went in on a pain scale of 6 out of 10 (lowered from 10/10 with physical therapy & at home exercise) and came out with 0 pain.

Your people were direct but polite and even patient.. just great.
I needed this test before the first open time I was able to schedule 12/26. I asked if I could be squeezed in today...in a slow time . ""Sure"" , was the answer.....super accommodating . I was in and tested and out of there in like 15 min.
Best yet, I got my NEGATIVE answer in less than 3 hours this evening.... They said it could take up to 24 hours.
So what did I think ..just a GREAT experience...kept up the good work.

Bill|Very smooth and quick procedure. Politely greeted by the nurse upon entry, easy guidance provided for the self testing, and done! Less than 10 minutes and we were finished. Great service to have in these challenging times to return back to normal|Legit testing site that is clean and well-run; it's my first choice when I need results for work. When I went at 8:45am I got rapid PCR results around 1pm the same day. Also as I was leaving my appointment an international traveler came in and the staff was proactively trying to figure out if they could bill his insurance instead of just charging him outright. Highly recommended.|Staff was pleasant and gave clear directions to the process. Accurate information and super quick. Very clean and organized space. I've been twice and both times were similar experiences when getting my Covid test. It's helpful to have kind people working when people are stressed about Covid. Thanks!|This place was awesome! I'm fully vaccinated, but still needed a RT-PCR test to fly to Ireland.

On the first visit, Dr. Barbara told me that my migraines were caused by my body structure and posture. I started to have some therapy sessions with Michael, which really helped me not to have any more migraines after about 2-3 weeks of visits. The treatment process did take some time but it's definitely worth it. Not only did Barbara and Michael treat me, they also educated me about how to have and maintain good body posture. Another thing that I also appreciate is that they didn't prescribe or recommend me to take any medicines at all, which lets me be more comfortable with my treatment process.|I have had chronic migraines for the past 7 years and have tried every kind of treatment imaginable.

As is often the case, I first went to a Chiropractor with little sustainable relief found.  After 1 treatment with Michael, I canceled my future appointments elsewhere and find that weekly treatments provide sufficient relief that allows me to remain active and relatively pain free.
I recommend Michael to anyone with neck and or back pain.|I slept on the wrong side of the bed and had been suffering with constant headache, nausea, neck and shoulder pain. After my first visit with Michael, I began to feel better. He was friendly and knowledgeable. I started seeing Michael a few times a week for treatments and eventually once every two weeks. The treatments have definitely help me feel better. I am so thankful for his help.|I had suffered for 15 years with severe migraine.

After 4 doctors who diagnosed me with different type of headaches from hormonal to migraine  and prescribed same medication, thousands of dollars in diagnosis and treatments and no relief. My former boss who had a history of pain and his wife who had a history of life headaches recommended me to Michael Pys. I came to see him with sharp headache and left with out it after first treatment, after 4 treatments my migraines decreased to ones in  2 weeks and after 8 treatments I had no migraine at all for 2 years.

I stopped see Michael Pys 2 years ago and my headaches recently came back. I have to drive about one hour to see him but it makes huge different the way I feel and function after each treatment. No drugs. I like it.

I was struggling with severe vein disease--my feet were so swollen that my ankles completely disappeared, and I was constantly fatigued. I felt weighed down every day, and nothing seemed to help.

Dr. Kang came highly recommended, and now I know why. He took the time to explain everything clearly and performed a vein ablation procedure that changed my life. The swelling has completely gone down, my circulation has improved immensely, and I finally have my energy back.

Thanks to Dr. Kang, I no longer have ""cankles,"" and I feel like a new person. My day-to-day life has improved in ways I never thought possible. If you're suffering from vein disease or circulation issues, I can't recommend Dr. Kang and the team at Midwest Anesthesia and Pain Specialists (MAPS) enough. They truly are the best of the best!|Whenever I visit the clinic, everyone is polite,helpful and attentive to my needs. I feel right at home. Their care and concern is evident.

(Prior to this with pain management doctors where I had previously lived before coming to the Chicago area)

Dr Hong was an excellent physician for me over the years. He was compassionate, thorough and worked together with me to try to relieve as much as was possible of my pain. Through MRI's, tests, pain meds,nerve blocks, a Neurostimulator Implant, and so on.
Sadly, However, Dr. Hong is no longer at Gateway Spine and Pain. Sadly there is no Gateway Spine and Pain. And this practice is no longer here for their patients needs. They are there for covering their selves.
It's just Pain and Spine Institute. With some very important changes in how they care for their PATIENTS AND about PAIN MANAGEMENT...

I am very concerned about the direction  the practice has taken since Dr. Hong left. It seems they are more interested in doing mostly UNNECESSARY and COSTLY procedures, including more MRI's, surgeries and who knows what else.
What Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Hinchley told me was the main focus of the practice now;  ""Interventional Pain Management"" , including lowering doses of my meds because, and I quote ""Dr. Hong has you on a higher doseage than current policies allow""
AS Well As COMPLETELY REVERSING the practices compassionate policies regarding the use of THC products (Now Completely Legal in Illinois by the way) and actually have helped with the nerve pain as well as getting a better nights sleep than taking care of a long standing patient who was primarily stable.

I believe this practice has forgotten their ""mission"" is supposed to be to help us manage OUR VERY REAL PAIN with what works not what some administrator decided is appropriate and takes options away instead of providing them...
NOT ONCE have I seen an actual DOCTOR since Dr. Hong left the practice to discuss my case, . I have no idea who this new Doctor is. (Dr. Jaison J. Thekkekara, MD) Never met him, never talked to him, ever.
Now, suddenly, Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Hinchley is all let's get it authorized to replace the old Neurostimulator which I explained would need to be done later  due to some personal issues.
Nonetheless, I started getting calls from the office and mail from some other almost immediately to schedule the surgery.
In summary Dr Hong leaves, Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Hinchley starts tinkering with my meds because they don't like the dose, wants to schedule surgery, reverses THC policy and not once did I talk to the doctor.

I know this review has been long (thanks for reading) I had to say something because I cannot in good conscience say I still recommend this practice. I believe that all this practice will do is give lip service to Pain Management and don't really care about their patients in the long term.

Hiding behind a Nurse Practitioner, One Size for ALL medicine, and not allowing compassionate policies regarding THC is not serving my best interest and may not serve yours...

Just got a text message and email from the office. ""It's been a while since your last visit. How has your pain been lately? Please reply or call our office if you need additional treatment.

Everyone was so nice and understanding, and eased my fears. Doctor Kapoor was very nice, knowledgeable, very kind and answered all my questions and concerns, took his time with me wasn't rushed at all. He explained the whole procedure.  My visit was a nice one. So far the shots have seemed to help my pain. Thank you|I just started seeing Dr Esparaz and he is very kind and compassionate. I got a shoulder injection yesterday and barely felt a pinch!
There are several ways to communicate with the staff, ie phone, patient portal, email, which is helpful for someone like me that works a lot. All the staff have been great.|Dr. Kapoor and his staff were professional and responsive for treating my neck pain.  The doctor took the time to listen to my pain complaints and come up with a treatment plan with me.  I felt comfortable during the procedure and with after care.  Highly recommend this practice for pain needs.|When an old neck injury flared up I did everything right, I went to the PT, did dry needling with the chiro, sought out sports massage and regularly go to infrared heated yoga but the pain didn't ease up. My muscles were spasming and felt so tough to touch. A friend of mine recommended I see Dr Kapoor and I am so ecstatic they did! He administered some injections around the site with expert precision and little discomfort. From the moment I entered the treatment room I was made to feel comfortable and his bedside manner was impeccable. Dr Kapoor is an expert in the spine and walked me through all of my questions and explained the treatment and plan in a way that was humble, technical and easy for a novice to understand.

My gosh this was today and the relief I have felt has been unrivalled, almost immediately I was able to gain a range of motion in my shoulder that I have not felt in months.

Now I can move freely and the pain has subsided completely. He's a true miracle worker and I cannot advocate for him enough.

Sometimes and especially with children and balancing a hard working schedule, it's difficult to carve out the time to take better care of yourself but all I can say is I am so glad I have and I'll most definitely return.

The staff are knowledgeable and I got an appointment at a suitable time within days of my call. Honestly this was exemplary service and I will not hesitate to return. The quality of life I now have is the best it has been in over 4 months. Thank you so much to Dr Kapoor and team, 5* !|Dr. Kapoor has canceled my appointment multiple times delaying my required treatments and care by months and changed locations multiple times. The office staff is kind but the amount of barriers the doctor creates to not have to do his job is absolutely astounding. I have had no treatments at either location and multiple cancellations for the past 6 months. I am at my wits end with getting an appointment. They also discriminate based on age because apparently younger adults can't have any pain or injuries.|Dr. Kapoor and his staff are great! Very knowledgeable and helpful. They always provide options for pain management and use best practices with the patients input to achieve their goals. Would highly recommend!|I have been going to this center for over a decade; although the doctors are incredibly competent, the rest of the staff is rude and unprofessional.  I have often times waited for over an hour for my appointment and have had 4 different doctors in the past year alone.  No one answers the phone, often takes hours to get a phone call back.  Was running 15 minutes late for an appointment today, tried calling, obviously no answer, and when I arrived I was told I couldn't be seen.  Guess it is time to find a new treatment center that has a reasonable standard for patient care.

Office staff is very courteous  and cooperative also|While Dr Chadha was pleasant in her demeanor, I will always regret my decision to have her perform a Stellate Ganglion Block on me to address my post Covid-19 loss of taste and smell. The SGB did not improve my taste and smell, and the next day I developed constant ringing in my ears (tinnitus) for the first time in my 56 years of life, and it continues to this day, 8.5 months later. When I reported this symptom to Doctor Chadha shortly after the procedure, she just replied she had never heard of tinnitus as a side effect of the SGB and suggested I see my primary doctor to see if ""something else"" might be causing it. Right, sure thing.... ;) Attempted to see an ENT and after explaining the timing of the symptoms and connection back to the SGB procedure by Dr. Chadka, he refused to see me and cancelled my appointment, saying I need to address it with her. With no other recourse, I then saw my GP who verified my ears were physically OK, then just said I have to live with it. So there you go. Just know that side effects are a real possibility to any procedure, hence the Doctor's requirement for the patient to sign a release before any procedure is performed. Not saying you will have any side effects, but if you do you will be on your own to figure it out and or just live with it for the rest of your life.

Without the shots administered by Dr. Chadha, there were times when I was unable to stand or walk for more than 15 minutes without intense pain.  She took the time to figure out which areas were the source of the pain as there was more than one issue going on at the same time.  If you've tried steroid shots somewhere else and they didn't help, I would still recommend that you consult with Dr. Chadha as her process is very thorough.

Even with their patronizing, canned remarks, I found they do not return calls from voicemail, and are apathetic at best on the phone. My upcoming visit should be interesting to say the least.
I will provide another review once that is complete.
UPDATE: As much as I hate to say it, my instincts were correct.  The provider I saw should give her diploma back..what a crock.|Honestly I wish they had a lower rating. I was referred to this so called pain center by my primary care provider here in Galesburg. I always try to stick with OSF doctors because I so rarely have an issue with them, so initially I was very hopeful that they would help me find relief from my fibromyalgia pain. When I went in for a new patient consultation I saw some NP named Colleen or something and she seemed very kind and understanding. I stated that I am on disability and can only get medication on the 3rd thru the 5th of each month. I stated that I had seen many friends fall to opiates and really preferred to only use them when there was NO OTHER CHOICE. She typed the whole time and I went home thinking that the flare I was headed for would be easier than others had. It was way worse. When I called the clinic as I was told to when the pain was severe, I spoke to a nurse named Laura or Lauren. She laughed outright at me and said she would make sure the NP got it. When the NP called me she was also laughing. I'm guessing they enjoy other's pain there. A Sadists Haven. I lodged a complaint and was quickly turned over to a doctor named McManus who I was told was the director. When he came into the appointment, he was abrupt and rude. The first thing he said was ""I hear you want some opiates."" I was furious. I told him that I wanted help with the pain and didn't appreciate being laughed at by his staff. The appointment was ultimately pointless as he agreed that the Benadryl that the NP sent a script to my pharmacy for would help the pain. I told him all it did was help with my allergies. My sinuses were clear for the first time in weeks. He prescribed baclofen and it mixed with one of my other medications and I became unresponsive twice. I caught a ride to his office because he insisted I come in so he could assess my state. He then told me to stop taking the conflicting medication that was given by another doctor without ever contacting her! I made the mistake of returning because I have no other option. He stated in the MyChart app in a message to me yesterday that they only work with ""chronic, unchanging pain,"" not fibromyalgia pain that just gets worse. My PCP, an ER, or an Urgent Care would have to handle my case. My PCP sent me to this place because she couldn't help. The ER will do nothing except perhaps run tests all day or night and maybe give me a shot. Urgent Care here is a joke. No help there. They send you to the ER. Do not go to this place if you actually need help.|Have been having trouble a lot with my neck, I had an injection done by dr Marshall. Jan 21, I was offered a 2nd injection after two weeks, of my symptoms haven't improved.I've been calling them since the 2 mark week,Every time I would try to contact there office(nurse ext) the nurses line never answered! Not once. I had to email, and I even told the scheduling that nurse never answered there extension and she still thru me to the nurses extension. I got my appointment scheduled for my injection Monday morning , I missed it and INOW March 4th Wednesday I called back to rescheduled. Was told I missed too many appointments to reschedule, which was incorrect I never missed an appointment with them. Than was told I'd get a call back, I was told it wasn't the fact that I missed appointments, dr Marshall just didn't want to perform the 2nd injection. Now I am furious because why would I get the scheduled appointment and now suddenly  just getting the notice that I can't get even  the injection! It has been chaos trying to get in contact with the plan clinic. The guy who I had my initial consultation was rude as well . It has been nothing but a chaotic mess. nothing less.. And now they throw this at me....I would not recommend this place.|The front desk tell you totally different ""rules"". One will say one thing, another will say something different. Even when I called my health insurance and they clarified with me, the office still called me a lie in so many words.  Also, It takes about one month or more to finally get in so you have to suffer even longer to finally get relief. Dr Baha is amazing though.|Totally took me off my pain meds and told me to go to the ER if I had withdraws after being on opioids since 207 If I could I would give 0 stars. This place is totally useless as with all so called pain clinics. Now I'm going to have seizures and with draws just had one this afternoon mild one from not having my meds. stay away at all costs. 0 and I mean 0 stars also thanks a lot for the convulsions and seizures and a weeks worth of bills i CAN NOT PAY|What the hell is going on down there ? I've called several times a day for the past week. Left several voicemails,with no return. What a mess!! I am so disappointed with this place. The only reason why I tried to get in,is becuase of my insurance. Save your self the misery and continue to Gaurdian pain clinic in Bloomington. Even if you pay out of pocket.

Innovative Pain Specialists in Arlington Heights and Libertyville, Illinois, was founded in 2011 by pain management specialists Paul Marsiglia, DO, and Demetrios Louis, MD.

He took his time to listen to my disability that I had been struggling with for a year and half. Rather than just preforming a standard possibly dangerous procedure, he had look at a different approach to as a possible solution. It ended up having great results. I feel that his patience had helped me find a positive solution to my issue. I could not say more.|I have been a patient of Dr. Marsiglia's for several years now.  I've been dealing with doctors just about al my life.  I was diagnosed with scoliosis on the 3rd grade and have multiple surgeries/ back fusions.  Dr Marsiglia and his staff are wonderful. He puts me at total ease and he doesn't make me feel awkward when I have questions.|Dr. Marsiglia is always thorough when explaining things to me.  He also explains as he is performing a procedure. I trust him and would recommend him to anyone.|The receptionist is a liar and is making up a false narrative about the conversations I had prior to my consultation to make sure I know their clinics imaging policies. The doctor did not actually do a real consultation on me, did not look at any of my scans which I have MRI's, CT, DMX, he only looked at the reports and added them to my profile which is not a consultation its just copying my records, and the doctor did not properly physically evaluate me, my conditions are physically evident and a professionally trained doctor can assess me from that alone, which many other doctors who actually know these conditions have been capable of doing but Dr. Louis did not do these assessments so there was no point of me having this ""consultation"" of my imaging notes just being copied. And I do not appreciate being lied to by this clinic as I see doctors for a very serious matter to try to get pain relief and this clinic was just low effort all around.|I have used Dr. Marsiglia several times now for back pain, epidurals specifically.
Communicates well and has a good bedside manner which is rare for good doctors these days.
The staff is equally communicative and accommodating.
Very happy and will continue to go back as long as I have to.|I would recommend innovative pain specialists with a high regard. Dr Paul Marsigia is an amazing doctor. He listens to what you have to say and comes up with a plan of care immediately. He is highly educated with pain management you will not be disappointed.|Like my previous visits, Dr. Louis was very attentive, thorough and decisive about next steps in my treatment after examination. He's terrific, and I'd highly recommend him.|Dr Marsiglia listened very well to my concerns. He was patient and gave me plenty of time to ask all my questions. I was thoroughly checked out on my back and legs were checked out. I was also given an order for an MRI to determine what type of injections would be best for my situation.

However, you should be prepared to wait sometimes. That's an office scheduling issue -- not Dr Hagle's fault.

He is compassionate, honest, understanding, knowledgeable, and will give you the best care for your pain so you can live life. I highly recommend him.|I have several illnesses, all causing chronic pain. I moved to St. Charles and had to leave my old pain doctor who I had for years and loved. I met with 2-3 pain management doctors in the area and had given up on finding someone who treats me well and manages my pain correctly. (One doctor ""didn't believe"" in 2 of my diseases (fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia) and said neurologists just ""make these up when they can't diagnose a patient properly"" . Mind you, TN is nicknamed ""The Suicide Disease"" bc of the pain level and rarely a cure found. ) Dr. Hagle was referred to me by my dentist whose office is in the same compound. He listens intently to your issues, helps find a plan to hopefully fix or decrease pain, and sometimes has been my ""therapist"" when I vent about my pain.

His office is very helpful with appointments, refills, and scheduling procedures. I've had injections and ablations done by him. Some successful, some not. He's always willing to try different procedures to help me, but will be truthful and not do when he knows it won't work. I've at times begged him to do one, acknowledging that it may not help at all. But he doesn't waste my money or his time when he knows I won't get relief. That shows me he's not taking advantage of me and is treating me correctly. I've been to ER many times because of pain. Every time I say his name there, the doctors and nurses at hospital talk highly of him. I've even had pharmacists who tell me how they like Dr. Hagle and how/what he prescribes to patients. Whatever type of pain you have and/or whatever intensity of pain you have, see Dr. Hagle. As you can see, I have lots of words of praise for him and it's still not enough.

I can move so much better now and the biggest thing for me was that I regained the 2 inches in height that I lost after my back surgery 1 year ago! Everyone here is amazing and very helpful. I don't know what my life would be like without this place, but it wouldn't be as good as it is now.

Orginal:  I have tried many places attempting to deal with my knee and back pain over several years now. I even tried back surgery (at under 30 years old). Nothing really helped and everywhere treated me poorly do to "" being to young to be in this kind of pain"". From the very first day I started at Superior health I have been treated fantastic! Everyone here is so kind and encouraging. I have only been going for a few weeks but I'm already feeling better than I ever have. My favorite thing about this place is that they are more of a total body health. They actually want to help me fix the underlying issues and not just give me meds for pain and sent me home. This place I like a family. You can tell how much they care just watching how they react when clients ""graduate"". Never seen another place like this. I look forward to coming here and can't wait to see how I continue to progress and get better. Your never to young or to old to live a life without pain.|Had one knee and shoulder treated.

###Update...I'm saw Dr Sparks and we've got a great program set up. I truely believe the staff wants to make me better. Thank you all!

Very disappointed I don't think I got the treatment I paid for. I felt relief for a while and thought all was good. Then the office closed and that was that. I couldnt get a answer on follow up. They say they want to make it right but another $4000 minimum. Guess I'm back to square one.|My wife and I have had some amazing results with my hips and her neck! After doing the 8 week program we both saw great movement on our X-rays. Between the adjustments, physical therapy, assortment of tools to use at home, and injections, we were given exactly what we needed to have successful stories:) We also work hard at home as well because that's so important!!

My mother has a condition in which she suffers with chronic pain. She has tried a number of different pain medications and non-phramacological measures and nothing has helped with my mothers pain. My mother does have past conditions that affect her from being able to take certain meds, therefore, treatment becomes limited.

This review is based off of how this doctor spoke to my mother, she told my mother that she doesn't understand why my mother cries when she sees her. My mother cries because you had told her, the pain specialist, there is nothing else you can do for her.

Do you know how devastating it is to hear those words from your doctor? How hard it is to deal with chronic pain. Pain that is constant each and every day. This is why she cried. She confided in you, someone that is suppose to and chose a profession in which should show some sympathy, some compassion.

All I can say is think before you speak, think of how your pts much feel living with pain, put yourself in someone else's shoes. Because if you can't show some compassion, I don't know what drove you into the profession.

They were able to address the exact issue and put together a comprehensive plan that significantly improved my day to day quality of life. Thank you so much!!!|Premier Pain and Spine physicians are truly the most compassionate doctors office I have been to. The doctors are very thorough when It came to my medical history. They explained all my treatment options in a way that I could understand and feel comfortable and confident in my plan of care. When you struggle with chronic pain it is so nice to come into an office that is compassionate, thorough, and above all there to help. Great experience from the time I checked for my appointment to the very end.|I've had many back injections by different doctors, in the past 5 years .  Premier pain & spine is by far the best.  Dr Amish Patel is excellent - he took time to meet with me and discuss my back issues and explained everything to me completely, as well as answering all my questions.
During the procedure , he explained what he was doing every step of the way.   The staff is excellent, and very caring.   I feel fortunate to have Dr Patel managing my pain issues.
I've visited both the Chicago and Downers Grove offices- both are wonderful.|I have been to a several other pain management centers in the past and Premier pain and spine is by far the best. The office staff is friendly, personable and professional. The doctors are empathetic, knowledgeable and proficient with injections. I do not feel rushed through appointments. I'm given ad much time as I need. It would be completely a pleasure to visit the office if I didn't have so much pain!.
The new PA Chris fits right in. He is excellent.|I was in extreme pain but the young lady that I spoke with was kind and patient.  I had left a message as a new patient to schedule and she returned my call promptly. Once I came for my scheduled appointment I found the receptionist polite, pleasant and informative. She explained the COVID19 protocol again as she had on the phone and I filled out the appropriate papers. All of the staff I met were patient professionals as I walked and maneuvered gingerly in pain. The assistant to Dr. Amish Patel was so patient and didn't rush me as I explained my car accident history which wasn't the reason I was there but I felt may demonstrate my overall pain and health history. Meeting Dr. Patel he made me feel comfortable, educated about my options and future. He didn't get upset when I had to schedule with Dr. Kapoor because of my scheduling issues. I will return to Dr. Patel for my follow up and I've very confident with Premier Pain & Spine and know and believe my pain will be manageable and hopefully over soon. I am highly recommending them to friends and clients that I know who are struggling to get back to a normal life because of pain.
Thanks Again,

5/2021|I had the worst possible experience trying to become a new patient of this center.

I tried calling Premier and Spine Chicago to set up an appointment as a new patient, and while holding, I was hung up on twice. The phone gets picked up and immediately put down.

On my third attempt, I spoke with a receptionist named ""Angelica"", and at first she started to answer my questions, and then she placed me on a ""hold"", which was hanging up on me again.

I proceeded to call two more times, upon which after holding for about 10 minutes as ""Patient #1 in line"", the phone picked up and immediately dropped.

Seriously, what a horrible company?|After 2 years of trying to get relief from low back pain with pills, lotions physical therapy and acupuncture I went to Premier Pain and Spine. After the doctor looked at my MRI he saw the problem and set about fixing it. Personally The PRP injections have done the trick for me. It is amazing how they give you more mobility but even more amazing how they change your mood and out look on life. So grateful!|My review is about the remarkable Dr. Firas Rafati, whom my husband sees for his severe pain at the PPS Chicago office.   For many months, my husband has had the privilege of being Dr. Rafati's patient, who treats him as though he was a member of his own family.

I left there feeling confident that I found someone was going to help me.....then the chaos began. Phone call telling me to get an xray on my left knee to get approved for those gel shots in the knee for osteoarthritis. My left knee had a knee replacement,  its my right knee I need the shots in. So this went on for 5 weeks if not 6. Then once this is straightened out, they never ordered the shots. So they canceled all the appointments I had scheduled and that screwed up my work schedule.  And if you ever need a returning appointment the will let you know 3 days a head of time what time you appointment is. Also the person who was checking me out in the end was eating a bowl of noodles and wasnt even on my chart when she started talking about the nextvstep. I said, wrong chart, thats not me. I know they must be short staff, but everything that pertained to me was a mistake on their part. Very sad, I heard the Dr was good, but man, noone had it right with me|I have nothing but horrible things to say about this place. Terrible customer service, terrible doctors, and the worst communication at an office yet. I just transferred here from my regular pain management office down in Des Plaines. The reason why I needed a transfer is because Des Plaines is over an hour drive for me, and with the Illinois roads, it makes the drive very uncomfortable, painful, and unbearable. This new pain management place is only a 10 minute drive from me. So I thought I would give it a try. This place is so bad that it is making my old pain management look like Disneyland. Mind you, my old pain management never answers their phones, and they are very difficult to get a hold of. The first visit with The Illinois Pain & Spine Institute, they already wanted to throw me onto the table and perform procedures on me. I was told that I need to do two sets of facet blocks in order to do my back ablations, which isn't true. I've had back ablations before. I played their game and scheduled two procedures that would leave me bed bound a week at a time per procedure. I needed to go under anesthesia for these procedures, and both of those times, I had a horrific experience. The first time, when they put me under, they had me in and out of the office within 15 minutes. I didn't wake up from anesthesia until I was in the parking lot getting loaded into my vehicle! I'm sure you can imagine how scary that is. I should have been in a recovery room while I awoke and came to. I told Dr.Hagel about my experience, and he said that he will definitely have an anesthesiologist in there the next time I get my facet blocks. I had also asked for calming medicine BEFORE I go into the operating room due to PTSD. However, they did not give me anything until I was already strapped onto the table in the operating room. Who gave me anesthesia the first time? It was a nurse who took some night classes and got a certificate saying that she could give anesthesia. She got the dosing wrong, obviously. My second time in there getting the same procedure with the facet block, they told me that they didn't have an anesthesiologist and that a nurse would be administering my anesthesia again. I was explicitly told that there would be an anesthesiologist in there to give me the correct dosing this time, and yet, there wasn't. I was awake during the whole procedure, and I felt everything! Then, to top it off, they put me in a recovery room, and a male nurse came in there and tried to take my shirt off. I told him to leave so that I could dress myself. I had a follow-up appointment that I scheduled myself because apparently, they don't schedule post-op appointments so that I may discuss what my experience was. I also wanted to schedule my back ablations. While on the phone, Dr. Hagel said that I was a ""pain in the ass"" and that I am lucky that I haven't gotten the boot yet because most people would have by now. I then began to tell him why I needed a real anesthesiologist for these procedures and about my PTSD and he seemed shocked and may have felt bad now knowing the reason why I am the way I am . I have woken up during procedures before, and I am a victim of other traumas I do not wish to air out. Regardless, they did not take the proper care or consideration that this kind of practice should have. To top the cherry, I had a telehealth appointment with Steve on Friday, and my pharmacy was out of my medication. I called the office to get it transferred to another pharmacy, and they never got Steve to rewrite my script for another pharmacy. Now, I am sitting without my medication for 3 days. I called their after hours line to speak to someone on-call, and their phone system hung up on me. I have to wait until Monday, and I hope they are able to rewrite me my script. My body is going through withdrawals, and this could have been avoided if they had just called my prescription over to a new pharmacy like they were supposed to. Steve said it only takes 3 minutes, not 4 days! Avoid this place at all costs!|Dr Hagel is awesome. The practice still needs to work on the support staffs rudeness,politeness and doing things correctly. Nurses are great|I saw pain docs for 12 years before I found these guys. Dr Hagle and Steve Perry are the best pain guys you can ask for.|Dr. Yacoumb I think that's how you spell last name. Highly recommend ! He is a doctor that listens and helps with my pain. Staff is great too|Iam giving 2 stars for the person in charge of scheduling. I made my appointment on June 27th  for July 17th at the McHenry office.  On July 10th I received a call from the Barrington office about my appointment there on July 15th.  Because of the severity of the pain I was having I chose the McHenry office  which is 10minutes from my home. After a intense conversation with Colleen who insisted I changed the appointment.  I called the McHenry office and was told the Dr  was overbooked and I was taken off the schedule.  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior from any health care facility.|Dr Hagel is a kind, compassionate , committed , caring doctor. He takes his time with you and listens! He cares about you and the pain you are living in and wants to give you the best quality of life you can have.|I felt heard by Dr. Prunskis.

I am pain free.|I have been a patient of Dr Ji Li's for over 16 years. He is phenomenal at his specialty of pain management. He takes the time to explain why you are in pain and what your options are, at that time. He is very conservative with his care, which I greatly appreciate. Because, 10 or 15 years ago a lot of ""so called pain doctors"" would start you on such strong medications, you loved them, because you were completely without any pain. But, with all pain medications, your body is going to develop a tolerance to any pain medications, after a period of time. Then, when those individuals return wanting stronger medication, those ""so called pain doctors,"" informed you that you must have been abusing the medication that we prescribed, because it should still be helping you. As a result, we can no longer treat you as a patient. They just left you literally ""High and dry!"" That is when good people, do bad things, because they truly believe they are going to die, if they don't get more medication. Unfortunately, there are plenty of drug dealers in any town, who will sell ""who knows what,"" to these individuals on a per pill basis. Please understand that Dr. Ji Li is a true Pain Management Specialist and would not willingly allow a single one of his patients to be in this situation. He follows strict protocols and requires you to sign a very strict contact, for your own wellbeing!

I saw him on August 10th in his Glenview office. He advised me to have my five pairs of orthotics modified. He took my orthotics and sent them to his chosen lab, DPM Orthotics, in Kent Ohio. After not returning my orthotics to me for over six weeks, he stopped responding to my phone calls. Both he and his staff ""ghosted me"". They just walked away from any responsibility to get them back. Unconscionable!
Finally, after two months I contacted the manager of Illinois Bone and Joint to get my orthotics returned. In the interim, Dr. Noxon moved his practice and is no longer associated with IBJ. I then reached out to IBJ's clinical manager, Sherry, for help. After two weeks of calls, I finally received a call back because I contacted her supervisor. She said that she would investigate this matter. After a week I received a call   from her stating that while IBJ accepted my orthotics, they share no responsibility for returning them to me and in her words, it was okay with her if I walked around with blood blisters and pain.  She unprofessionally stated that she doesn't care who else I contact.
The five pairs of orthotics are quite expensive, and Medicare does not cover the cost.  I am a senior citizen on a fixed income and cannot afford to replace them. I'm writing this review to make others aware of the totally irresponsible, unprofessional behavior of Illinois Bone and Joint. I would never trust them again!

I was injured on the job a year ago.  I had a bad knee injury,  that could have led to surgery. I was in a lot of pain and I barely could walk.  I looked up the Softwave treatment.  And it was a blessing,  they specialize in no surgery and no injection.  That was good to hear.  I went to the Pain Institute 2 twice a week with my Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance coverage.  I got laser treatment and exercise.  I'm 100% now,  I could not do stairs without pain.  Now I can do stairs without mo problems.  It took a while but I did it . These ladies are the best here at the pain Institute in Glenview IL,  Shannon is super nice and very patient with me and also did my laser twice a week. Awesome experience the laser saved me from surgery.  Samreon very nice and polite lady always called me the day before therapy to remind me.  Dr. Mariam El-Baghdad was very nice and came in and examined my knee injury and made recommendations.  I am  so happy that I came here and would recommend anyone to the Pain Institute in Glenview IL only.  Wonderful experience,  the rest of the staff are great.  The Pain Institute is the best in the entire city of Glenview IL. Very happy that I came there.|Was referred to PRI by a family member with similar issues, chronic knee pain. Got an appointment, met with the doctor and agreed to the procedure (P2P and gel shots). During treatment I did their PT regimen which was conducted by a couple different therapists. Everyone I interacted with here was friendly and knowledgeable of what their mission was. Bottom line, I got the relief I sought and my knees haven't felt like this in years.|Very discriminatory place.  Only interested in money!  I have insurance fully covered and they insisted I pay the same bill again on last visit after confirming payments sent to them from insurance.  I gave them the check numbers and dates and still no?! Pay it again?!  Calling their own billing dept is too cumbersome and complicated for them.  Instead they prefer to send an email to ask and confirm.|I was very impressed by the staff and Dr. E. I'm now deciding what I'm going to do if I'm going to do PRP injections or what for my knee. They were very very informative|I have had PRP and StemForce and my knees feel better than they have in two years. Great staff. Very friendly.|Had a very bad lower back,Dr Tom fixed that,3 other Chiro 's couldn't. Have a bad knee,(bone on bone),not afraid of surgeries,had 4 open hearts but it's a big deal for me because I take blood thinners so a knee replacement is a big process,hospital stay and recovery so I tried this and so far it's going very good.|The ""Keep You In Pain (Institute)""!

Dana called me after my terrible first appointment for feedback. The doctor took that feedback personally, and was standoff-ish with me during my next appointment where they asked me to come back. Shannon and the staff there are nice but they don't listen to you and certainly don't care about helping you.

Avoid this place at all costs. They call themselves an ""institute"" but there's no thinking outside of the box. There's no learning here or an openness to do so. Nor is there any adaptation to patients' needs. In particular, younger patients. They mostly seem to ""treat"" elderly people. They're therapy is mostly the therapists watching you do exercises you could do at home. The small bit of hands-on stuff they did wasn't very helpful. They will rope you in with false promises then suggest expensive out of pocket treatments like PRPs. They also like to call you incessantly if you don't answer right away or are busy instead of just leaving a brief message. If I didn't answer the first 3 times why keep calling and not simply leave a message?!

In the end, I wasted a lot of time and money bothering with this place and suggest you not do the same. If you have rare or persistent chronic pain issues you're better off avoiding this place. I'd write more but Google doesn't allow you to type that much for reviews.

Edit: Reply to their reply

You call the doctor and Shannon wasting my time and not listening to me above & beyond?! You call not informing me that my visit would be only be a ""talk"" with the doctor above & beyond and still require a copay? You call charging me and my insurance for mostly useless efforts with little regard to my needs or previous experiences above & beyond?? I don't think so. This wasn't even my complete review. It was shortened because Google has a character limit. Also, I normally don't even bother with reviewing clinics like this. My treatment here was so negative that I had to. You are welcome to look my my past reviews on Google. You will find few reviews of medical clinics. What's actually unfair and unjust here is the fact that this clinic can get away with what you do and call it healthcare. Especially after you people contacted me looking for feedback after my first treatment with the doctor. Above & beyond?!! What a joke!|The copay was $55. Medicare listed it at $45. And just like another reviewer said, they tell you it's approved by your insurance. During all my visits they never once asked for any other payment so I was shocked to receive a $727.88 bill!  And as a bi-note, the gel injections didn't work. I also went to joint relief institute a few years ago. They didn't try to pull this stunt. Charged copay and that was it. So when this company says I made a mistake, trying to say it was the other company, I didn't.",2024-10-15|2024-07-22|2024-10-16|2024-12-17|2024-11-21|2024-01-05|2023-09-21|2023-03-08,5|5|1|5|5|5|1|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJzU9Oeq_HD4gRcAUSJKdE6_w,80

Called to make appointment on July 9th, 2024. Gave insurance information and appointment was made for months later. (Sept)  I had forgotten when appointment was and called on September 3rd, 2024 for reminder.  Message left for me from clinic on September 4th, 2024 stated they do NOT except my insurance and would NOT be able to help me.  My major complaint with that is that I'm in severe pain and I was waiting to be seen. If my insurance was not exceptible, they should of told me sooner. I went without help for months waiting. And now I'm in the same boat I was in, in July!  
NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL AT ALL!

ZERO stars.|First, let me say that. I have been a critical care/ER/PACU nurse for almost 40 years. I am extremely careful who I see for medical care. Found out I have a degenerating condition that causes extra bone to be deposited in various areas. I've dealt with this for 30 years and have seen numerous doctors, with no actual diagnosis. I saw Dr. Tubic, who diagnosed me in q0 minutes, then confirmed it on both CT scan and MRI. This disease causes multiple bone spurs to develop, pressing on nerves in my spine and causing extreme pain throughout my body, specifically my head, my shoulders, and my lower back. It also causes tendons and ligaments connected to my spine to turn into bone. Also causes vertebrae to fuse together, stopping normal movement. As a result, I consulted the pain clinic about 4 years ago. I have had a ton of procedures and a spinal cord stimulator implanted. Both the doctors and the nurse practitioners have been great to work with. I have mentioned recently that I wanted to get off opiate pain medicine, since it knocks me out badly. They have worked with me to provide alternatives. I am now looking at an implanted pump that can distribute medicine to control the severe muscle spasms that come with this. I had to stop working about 4 years ago and their staff had to go through a ton of paperwork for my short and long term disability, including my application for state disability. I can't recommend them enough! Yes, they are usually very fast with their appointments because the doctors focus on interventional pain relief. If you want actual answers and pain management, call for an appointment. The first time you'll likely see a doctor, but the nurse practitioners and PAs handle it from there. They are knowledgeable, esp. Natalie K. I schedule procedures with whatever doctor has an opening because I trust all of them. And for all the negative reviews about insurance denials, THE ISSUE IS YOUR INSURANCE, NOT THE CLINIC! And yes, many insurances take more than a month to issue either a rejection or approval. They do this to try and get you to give up and not get things done.|I've had a fabulous experience here with Dr. Tubic. I appreciate his understanding of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and the complications that come with it. He has been super relentless in figuring out how to reduce my pain. Only giving 4 stars because the front desk folks never answer the phone and sometimes don't return voicemails.|I'm giving 2 stars on this even though I would like to leave 1 but the office staff/nurses are all very nice, courteous, and helpful. I don't feel the same way about the standard of care from my doctor though.

I went to pain management yesterday for my tailbone that I broke a while ago and saw Dr. McDaniel. He was 50 minutes late to my appointment and then rushed me through mine. He was aware I'm on disability for fibromyalgia yet with barely any warning he pulled my pants pretty low and slipped his finger down my crack and pushed really hard. It was excruciating. Then he bent me backwards from the shoulder on each side which was also painful... not so much to the tailbone but my back. He was too rough and I felt a little violated and not listened to. He told me he wants to give me a shot in my tailbone and more x-rays, didn't tell me what kind of shot or go over any risk factors or questions I might have. He just left the room and I assumed he was coming back with my paperwork but he had moved on to the next patient. The nurses came in to give me my paperwork and I asked about pain meds til my shot and I had to wait another 20 minutes in the lobby because he was with another patient. The nurse came out looking sad and said he refused and to take Tylenol. I wasn't even given a reason. He also wants to use only local anesthetic for my shot as opposed to sedation because I'm not squeamish with needles but wouldn't someone with severe fibro fair better with this under sedation? I feel very uncomfortable and do not trust him. I'm waiting to hear back from my primary about her opinion on it but honestly I just came home yesterday and cried.|I wish I could rate them less than one star. Staff is rude, and uncompassionate. I called to schedule my mom for a Dr. Visit, they confirmed they received the referral and asked me about her health insurance. I provided them with all information, they told me to call me back within 48 hours after running the insurance and verifying it. They called and scheduled her. After waiting for two weeks we took my mom that has been suffering back and neck pain, staff ignored my wife explaining to them and the situation. They told her that they couldn't find a refferal for her and don't accept her insurance. Then they said they found the referral and I gave them the wrong insurance althight they said they verified the insurance and the insurance name and the ID is on the refferal.they didnot apologize for their mistakes and rudes. Now we have to start looking for another Dr. This review is not about the Dr. It is about the s stsff kike that need to be fired or out on corrcgive acrion for messing up with people pain.|I was going to start as a new patient!  With that being said I received a call back and the lady who called me was not nice at all she was very rude ! As well as I explained to her I have a cancer doctor that I have to pay for as well as other doctors I need to pay for if my visit is 75 for first exams or 175 I needed to know!  And I have a deductible I need to meet ! And she had the nerve to tell me you need to take that up with your insurance company on what you will be charged ! Once again I told her it has nothing to do with my insurance company I have a deductible first and foremost.  And she kept saying we will bill your insurance!  As I told her you have no knowledge about deductible!  But then they say stright off we don't accept state insurance!  This office will never get my money!  Never ! I will deal with my pain before I will ever give an office like this my money ever ! I will give it to a homeless person on street before I give them money ever !for them stright off the back to tell me they have no control over what the insurance charges  that tells me you think people are stupid!  Insurance companies don't change your office does and then you bill what you want ! I feel bad for the people they was able to steal from and get there money that h! They need to shut this office down as far as I am concerned!  They just want deducted and copays and charges probably a arm and a leg to even for the doctor to lay there eyes on us ! And probably charge for the chairs you sit in ! That is how I took the very rude person that called and work me up out of my sleep!  When I clearly left a message and told them I work the 3rd shift call me around 4pm or after or early morning!  Right there that upset me as well !they don't know how to respect people that are going to pay or nothing!  People like me that have high deductible rates pay there Bill's.  Thank goodness I have not and will not go too this doctor!  If the receptionist talks like this over the phone on first phone call ever I can just imagine how the doctors are going to be!  I will pass hope all you that plan to visit fo the same and find a doctor that will really help your and treat you the right way physically and emotionally!|For many years I suffered alone because I look healthy. Turns out I have a connective tissue disorder. I was referred by a brilliant health psychologist who knows Dr. Tubic, the whole 6 weeks of waiting I was so excited to meet him but I had no idea how much he would really change my life. He flies around the office with a huge smile on his face, voice carrying throughout the practice. He is sincere, enthusiastic, and although he must be quick to accommodate us all (how does he even do it?), I always leave feeling excited about the next steps. He has a wealth of knowledge he always shares with me and is proactive in his treatments which makes a huge difference in my quality of life! I have made huge progress in the last 8 months and am looking forward to the future. His entire office and medical staff is incredible, so helpful and caring. I've learned so much from his nurses already. Office visits and procedures are days I look forward to!|I came from another clinic and I am so very grateful that I have. The staff is wonderful and really cares about you and gets to know you on a personal level and that alone is rare and Dr Tubic definitely cares about you and does not give up on you and your quality of life and he is above and beyond caring for his patients from the day I met him he has given me hope and kept me going and fighting to get to a better quality of life than I have had in a long time. Natalie is my life saver and she really cares about you as well and is very sharp with picking up when something is going on before you even say anything. That's what makes you a good nurse but I feel that she's more qualified and she knows how to make sure you are ok. I love this Dr practice and I highly recommend them to you. Thank you all so very much for your support and great staffing and Dr Tubic and Natalie.

Few months ago, I had a car accident, and it was my first (and I hope last) experience in the US.

The next day I found Global Clinic, so I called to get more information, and I got answers to all my questions and made an appointment.
From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by very kind and welcoming staff. Everyone was incredibly helpful, and I was especially impressed that almost all stuff speak multiple languages, which makes communication very easy
I had a chance to meet there 2 therapists: Jesse and Nikolay, both are real professionals, they helped me to recover faster, gave me some recommendations and communication was very good. Also, Mariana was very nice and helpful, she was trying to do her best if I arrived earlier
At every step of my treatment, they were genuinely caring, always checking in on my progress and adjusting my therapy as needed.
Overall, the clinic has a great environment, with skilled professionals who truly care about their patients. I'm very grateful for their help and would highly recommend this place to anyone in need of post-accident treatment or any similar issues you may have.

I have had 4 months of relief now and was reassured that I could return for another injection as needed and after consultation. Dr. Divan was totally professional knowledgeable and kind. I felt comfortable describing my situation with him and will not hesitate to return. My injection was followed ny a prescription for PT with a gifted therapist at this same Center, Aleksander ""Alex"" Kerzee-Stamatelopoulos. His experience and work is focused on this specialty. Alexis the best and most effective therapist I have worked with. I have successfully avoided spinal surgery and will return to Dr. Divan and Alex if I need future consultation and/or pain relief. I cannot more highly recommend this excellent team!|Total waste of time.  I am a mail carrier and just because I wasn't in pain, on the day, of my visit(I was on a week's vacation), I was told to call if I needed an injection.  Called 2 months later, when I needed an injection, and was asked, by the female on the phone, what kind of injection I needed.  I told her to look on the screen and she stated that the dr. had not put anything about an injection.  Also, they don't make appts. after 4 pm.  Some people have jobs.  If they don't want to work, Northwestern should shut this wasted facility down.|Horrible place don't go here. CNP Steven Stakenas was rude, neglecting, and just seemed like he didn't care. The staff communication is terrible. I was in a lot of pain when I went for a visit, waste of time. I provided all the info over the phone and online before the visit to make things faster. When I got there they had nothing on file. They had to get all my info again.

Since he moved out of state, my current doctor and his PA have decreased my meds, not once, but twice. I never complained about it or tried to do anything to get them increased again.These days, I find myself basically needing to be at the PA's beck and call to come in whenever she sees fit, or else she threatens to withhold my medication (both of which I've been taking for years with no issue. And both which would be dangerous to stop cold turkey). My previous doctor understood that because I'm in my 30s with a job AND a small child, that my availability is not the same as most of their clients who are twice my age. I wouldn't be going through all of these super painful procedures, having to renew FMLA each year, etc if I didn't need to.

He said he doesn't treat chronic pain patients like me, and that even HE has pain.  Since it was obvious his pain must be more credible than mine in his opinion, I asked him how could he know how MY pain feels? He saw me dragging myself into his office, all stiff and bent over at the waist while he in his ""pain"" was prancing around in no pain!  He of course had no answer

And even giving my history with proof of my various degenerative spinal issues, which he never even looked at, he was constantly rude and nasty!

STAY AWAY!  This guy is not a caring doctor! I don't know how he's getting any good reviews, unless he has some secret system in choosing who gets pain mgmt and who doesn't get it!|I would never come here again, I got out of the hospital with a broken collarbone which required surgery and hardware, a shattered wrist which was in 7 pieces and too had surgery requiring hardware, got my eyesocket broken, severed nerves in my face, head split open all across my entire forehead, injured my lower back and finally multiple compressed disc's in my neck, I fell over 30 feet off scaffolding and this doctor was not interested in treating my pain he wanted money to run tests and try alternative medications. Yep it's all true and this doctor will not manage your pain,  he makes it worse.|Despite Dr. Chen being a great, skilled doctor who really tries to help with pain, the billing department is incredibly difficult to work with. Getting an EOB and/or statement with breakdown of services takes a lot of work. When I finally received this, I discovered I've been billed for services that I did not receive. Many of these charges are coming out of pocket (although I'm sure the insurance company won't be thrilled about the additional charges either.) I've been trying to get an answer from billing for months and they are horrendous at communication. They refuse to answer why I've been charged for these services or to make the adjustment to take these off. I am now in the process of reviewing 3+ years of statements to see what other services I was charged for that I never received. If you go to this outstanding doctor, ask for a breakdown of your services EVERY TIME and check the codes!|The only reason I give top pain a two is that the doctor did a fine job and helped my husband. However, billing has been a complete nightmare. Not only was the billing department rude (2021) but for two years I've been trying to get a substantiated bill that shows why their number is different than mine. We're off by a lot. No one has been able to help me. They say they'll email me and then six months later, I'll get another bill. I'll call someone will be very nice say they'll help me and six months later I will get a bill. This is been going on for over two years. I can't even recommend this doctor because of his billing department.  And for the record, I rarely write reviews.  I just feel so strongly on this one.|Dr Chen didn't cure my pain, I got 3-4 injections with minimal results, I do believe I have piriformis syndrome, I suggested him to treat me with Botox injections, I've read are more effective and plasma injections, ultrasound guided.

I was convinced everyone was in it for the money

My Mother is a patient of Dr. Belmonte and had been urging me for about two years to check him out. I finally gave in to her suggestions and had my first appointment with Dr. Belmonte 4-6 months ago.

I cannot say enough good things about Dr Belmonte and his staff. His office staff is extremely professional and the office is filled with a positive energy! The experience is not like anything I had run into in the past. Dr. Belmonte had a treatment plan in about 20 min! He is unbelievably intelligent and a true master of his craft.

I've been seeing him about 5-6 years now and would recommend him to anyone who needs a Dr who cares about you. He really goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable.

I have a look of surprise as I was taken back that computer work for an hour would supersede a patient waiting in the office for a follow up visit REQUESTED BY THE DOCTOR. The ladies at the desk but stated they'd let the doctor know I was there and would tell him again. Once returning, they told me he said he was dealing with an emergency and asked if I could wait a few more minutes. I agreed to wait the additional 15-20 min which would total an hour at which point I would leave. Miraculously, the doctor came into see me 3 minutes later. Long story short, no apologies or empathy and simply made me friends my head in a few directions before deciding I needed another procedure. When I questioned it I couldn't get a clear answer understanding. I later inquired with office staff if I was being billed for a 6 min appointment after waiting an hour. They stated I would be.

I am a patient of Sarah Sloan, she is kind, personable, and compassionate. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this business. The staff is wonderful. The nurses are wonderful. 10 out of 10 would recommend|My husband was a patient here, but we will never step foot in this building again.  We had success at first as a new patient in April and May. He had a steroid injection in May. Dr Graham was very good with that, and the nurse practitioner was also thorough.  However, we did have a problem in May, from Jay who does the insurance pre- authorizations.  He did not send in the pre- authorization in a timely manner and said my husband may not be able to get the injection that day.  We had to call the insurance company and try to get a supervisor to approve it, which we did. (They said it was day 4 or 5 of the approval process, which is why they could approve it).
Fast forward to August, he was having neck pain. They put him on a medication, and said they would have to get him on the schedule for a neck injection and would call him. 15 days later we called to see if he was on the schedule yet.   They were very rude stating they only have 1 dr and limited staff and he was still not on the schedule, to wait until they call him.  The next day, they called him and said they scheduled it for 45 days out.  That neck injection procedure was scheduled for 3 pm.  My husband came home from work and we were getting ready to leave.  Jay, the guy who works in the insurance, called my husband at 1 pm, 2 hours before the procedure and after 45 days of being scheduled) and said the insurance hasn't approved it and that if they didn't approve it, he couldn't get it done.  We called again (this is the 2nd time this office has not done the pre authorization correctly). United Healthcare said that Jay didn't send the pre authorization paperwork in until late the day before the procedure, and the turnaround time is 7-10 days. Jay called in and put ""urgent"" the day he was supposed to have the procedure, but urgent still takes 48-72 hours. After 2 reps and a supervisor with the ins company, they said they couldn't do anything and that Jay didn't get it submitted in time.  We called Jay back and told him this.  He said it was just ""OUR"" insurance and all other companies ""just approve it"". My husband said he would just sign a self pay because we knew it would get approved shortly after, and Jay said if we could make it by 3, yes we could. It was 2:15 & we had a 45 minute drive.  We had conversations with Jay on the way about trying to still getting it approved, self pay, my husband had been given 2 Valium to take which he did.  After Jay continued to be rude and had no empathy for any of this, I told him he has failed at doing his job now twice. He didn't send in the paperwork in a timely manner twice. He waits until the last minute to do anything.  I've been in insurance over 26 years, and I know pre authorizations don't work the night before..  and that its not just ""our insurance.  He then called us back and told us he had called Dr Graham and told him not to do the procedure whatsoever that day when we pulled into the parking lot right at 3. I told him I was outside the building with my husband who had taken 2 Valium for the procedure. He said he didn't care and he wouldn't allow the procedure to commence. I walked into the building absolutely furious and asked for Dr Graham or the office manager. They made me wait forever and never came out. I left and told my husband we would never step foot in that office again. I would NOT recommend this office to ANYONE! No one ever called to say they were sorry, to follow up, nothing. 4 weeks later, they call my husband out of the blue to confirm his injection procedure for the next day and to call back.  No one ever called to tell my husband they had even scheduled this, or to follow up from the cancellation of the neck injection.  This office does not follow up, does not care about you, and is not ran efficiently.  If you are looking for a good place, we recommend Dr Beuer, any of his PA'S and Barnes Christian Hospital Pain Management Center in St Louis. Phone # 314-653-5228. They actually run a great practice, schedule what you need that day,  and do the pre authorization correctly, unlike this office.|I've been trying to get a call back for 2 weeks!  I have left 5 messages.  They have a Referral from my surgeon, he sent it May 6th...today is the 21st. Did call the patient experience line and left a message.  Wonder if they'll call me back?  I wouldn't bug them so much but I need pain management, guess I'll go to the ER again.  At least they help me.|Dr Graham and Sarah are very knowledgeable  and do everything possible to help me with my back and neck problems. Any of the staff that I've had contact with are very nice and efficient. I recommend the pain clinic to anyone who suffers with pain.|Horrible experience with one of the nurses. I had been going for nerv blocks and other treatments for sometime, a year or more. This time while taking my vitals the nurse decided she needed to put the pulse ox on my paralyzed hand/arm. I'm paralyzed due to brachial plexus injuries. My arm is completely atrophic and my fingers have curled up because of this, and I have CRPS on top of it. This is painful I let out a paind yelp and she gets angry. Now she argues with me about my pain medication then snatches my paperwork out of my hand causing some to hit me in the face and some to fall on the floor. I got up said you aren't going to throw things at me and walked out. This lady then proceeded to get me kicked out and wrote false information in my patient profile causing yet even more troubles with my healthcare. I was only going there to receive help because it is the only place around here that can help me. In no way was I going in there to be a burden or malicious. I did not deserve this treatment. I have a whitness that was sitting in the room and saw the entire thing!|Scheduled a consultation for my back pain.  I was at the facility less than 30 minutes, 20 of which was sitting around waiting.  Less than 5 minutes with the actual doctor, who seemed perturbed that I was referred to him.  He asked a few questions then recommended I go to physical therapy.  I was billed $1,000 for the visit...$700 for the doctor and $300 for the ""use of the facility"".  I would not recommend this place.|Discovered I had degenerative disc disease, pinched a nerve in my back and after 2 day I couldn't even walk.

If you ever have a doubt and are in need of seeing Doctor See my opinion would be to know you're in good hands.|I have been seeing Dr. J. See for several years now.  He is very easy to talk to and he is a good listener.  I cannot imagine seeing any other doctor.  I am so glad that I was referred to him.
He is a very kind and caring doctor.|The entire staff from the receptionist at the desk the medical assistant and Dr. are very professional and very helpful. I've gone to him a couple of times for pain management and he's always come through for me and even recommended a massager that I can use at home, which has worked wonders as well. You can tell that they care about their patients and that is very very important to me. I worked in the medical field for 37 years so I know how it is to be professional friendly and have alot of empathy for patients and this means a lot to me as well.|Dr See was very helpful I have been going to him for a few years now.  Although Dr See is great I feel his staff is not very friendly or empathetic.  People that are going to a pain specialist  are going  for a reason. They are in pain. .

He cut from my pain meds because I didn't have them in my system at time of piss test.    Who goes to pain doc high as kite so you can't really tell them where it hurts.

He listen to what you have to say. All doctors should be like him. And for his staff I love them to they are very kind and considerate. Couldn't ask for any better.

It has gone downhill. My orthopedic  surgeon sent me to the hospital near where we live in Freeport and Elizabth Kuhn kicked me out because  the doctor there gave me a Norco. She told me I was taking meds that she had not prescribed. It has made me not trust doctors now.|Doctors are very thorough and well staffed due to it also being teaching hospital.  State of the art ultrasound for instrument use and insertion of needles for treatment.   Impressive staff and building.   Great physician.  If i were getting a hip replaced,  i would see them.|Please do yourself a favor and do not see Jeanne! I had gone to get some help with a prep op order from my orthopedic! She couldn't even read the order and insisted it was post help! My Orthopaedic the next day said that was not how the order was written! WHAT I could barely get there. Please don't go try another center! I would like to hear from Kiswaukee's manger that mangers this women!|Jeanne was the rudest person I have met. Withing the first 5 minutes she took my tramadol away the my primary doctor wrote the prescription for my fibromyalgia. Without even talking to me about my fibromyalgia she said you don't need tramadol for that. I was standing because my back is pretty messed up and my sciatic nerve was flaring up and my arthritis is bad. She told me to sit down. I told he I would rather not because of the sciatic nerve and my arthritis was hurting bad. She said "" I have said I have arthritis to and it hurts so you can sit down"". My chiropractor took xrays and don't think she even looked at them. She have me 20 tramadol and told me to wean of the ones my doctor had been giving me. All and all she was rude and had no compassion for her patient. She rushed through the appointment. Had me do what she wanted me to do, not want made me comfortable as a patient and a human being. The only thing she did do was order a MRI. My second visit was just as bad if not worse. So I have to live in pain because she chooses i'm not bad enough for pain meds or she does not want to prescribe said pain meds.  That's a huge choice for someone to make that is not even a doctor. It is also inhumane to treat a person like that. To make them live in pain because you chose to not give them pain medication.|I have always  had the best care at the KSH pain clinic. Jeanne is wonderful and very caring.  Dealing with  people who are in pain is a difficult job. Filtering patients who are addicted to pain killers is a tedious chore. God bless her and the staff in the pain clinic.|Dr. Jerry Loch is fantastic. We had a situation yesterday. Much confusion. My partner was in the ED and I needed answers. I walked up to his office. He came out and spoke with me, then walked back to the ED to address the situation. He went above and beyond to help us in the situation. Thank you Dr. Jerry Loch!|I would have left less than one ""star"" actually but the ranking system doesn't allow for less that one star, unfortunately. And I went to N.W.P.C. originally in the naive hope of continuing a pharmaceutical medicine regimen started approximately a decade ago by my physician.  Unfortunately, my doctor's retirement caught me up in the doctor's corporate parent's policy dictating that I had to go to N.W.P.C in order to continue the same level quantity and type of medicine since I never abused it. I actually went with great hope that a facility doctor would assess me so imagine my surprise when I was assigned to a nurse practitioner (that's a nurse with a Graduate Degree in some medical arts field)- with little practice experience who ordered a variety of tests-costing Thousands of Dollars-- that I had already gone through and which my insurance wouldn't pay for because of that very reason. When I told this to the nurse practitioner, on a paid second assessment meeting, I was informed that was my concern and even though the nurse practitioner freely conceded more than once during this meeting I had medical conditions requiring specified care that it was the policy of N.W.P.C. to not prescribe opiates for pain control but, instead, use ""diffent modalities""--such is psychobabble for meditation, bio-feedback and such. When I asked that it meant I still would NOT be given the medicines I needed even if I managed to scrounge up the money for the redundant tests, it was tactily acknowledged by the nurse practitioner that despite my very real need for the type of care offered by these LEGAL and commonly used medicines, I wouldn''t be prescribed them. Furthrmore, it was mentioned that my now former doctor had ""over-prescribed"" opiates and that all similarly-situated patients were undergoing the same (LACK?) of treatment. It was almost funny that both of these fundamental components of this discussion were NOT mentioned during my first session with the same nurse practitioner: the only mention had been about ""dfferent modalities"" but NOT that the nurse pactitioner wouldn't prescribe LEGAL opiate medication, and when I asked if she was inferring my then (but now retired) doctor had over-prescribed in her opinion, the only response was a blank stare from the nurse practitioner. It strikes me that it is easy to be boldy disparaging about a colleague's professional expertise when that colleague can no longer refute that claim.  Furthermore, to treat--or NOT treat similarly-situated patients of the same retired doctor as a gebmneralizex unfeeling burueacratic approach at best...in my humble opinion.To be clear, I write this not to share my ""tale of woe"" because no one besides my relatives will care--and I have my doubt that a couple of them will be concerned--but to let current and future patients of this facility know that they should inquire at the very beginning of the first session what their policy is regarding issuing opiate presciptions to patient's already receiving lawful prescriptions for some time now and how burdensome and expensive the process will be to even find out if you ""qualify"" for consideration of said prescriptions.  In my opinion, the only loss worse than your time and money to participate in this process is the possible loss of self-esteem when, in my opinion of my two experiences, you realize it all seemed to be a charade to force credible patients to stop using prescribed LEGAL medicine--whether they want to stop or not. Of course, the worst effect would obviously be the loss of medicines essential to the well-being of the patient, wouldn't it? As a disclaimer, this is simply my opinion; albeit supported by copious recordings of the events detailed in my account of my experiences.

After 7 back surgeries and a total hip, I will never see anyone else! If you require special injections, Dr.Hashim has the best hands I know. I'm a R.N., and have seen many injections but none as good as Doctor. If you do not like following the current requirements by law for prescription medication for pain don't choose Dr. Hashim! She follows the law, you will feel safe, my pharmacist states it's always right. Just remember when you're a chronic pain patient you want a doctor who follows the rules and keeps you safe! I've been her patient over 15 years!|I am no longer in neck pain thanks to Dr. Hashim. I have faith she will fix my lower back pain too. Even when something doesn't work, she never gives up and keeps trying for a fix. She keeps things very simple and to the point so that you can receive the best care possible as soon as possible. She works in a certain way in order to get you out of pain quickly by sticking to the facts. She suggests what she thinks should be done, schedules it as soon as possible, and even confirms it with the insurance all at once. If it doesn't work because injections are 50/50, she tries another approach. Coming from a girl who contemplated her life due to her chronic pain; I appreciate her so much and know how much she cares.|I waited several months after leaving this practice to think about my experience and write a review. I would highly not recommend this practice or doctor. First and foremost, the cost. I was self pay and she charged me double what I am paying at a much bigger practice. I am also self pay there. She also always presumed I didn't have the out of pocket cost to pay for injections. Maybe at her inflated costs, no I wouldn't have. But I did at my new place, Gateway Spine. It was still expensive and she shouldn't make assumptions. Nor should she be over charging for sub par care. I keep getting bills that randomly get bigger and bigger for the same dates or service. I will not be paying. Being I was self pay, there should never be a bill. Then there was the care. It was horrible. She has zero bed side manner and she actually speaks down to you. It all felt very narcissistic which is the last quality you want in a doctor!  She has no trust between her patients. Requires you to bring in old prescriptions counts every pill. She might say this is required or standard but I highly doubt Gateway Spine and all my other pain doctors aren't following the law and standards when it comes to prescribing pain medications. I'm not required to do that anywhere else it's her own thing.  My first appointment was THREE long agonizing hours and she is ALWAYS running behind and all follow ups were super long. I get it there was a lot to review and, I've never had that lengthy of an appointment with any other pain doctor, so it is indeed possible to use appointment time for efficiently. She would literally scold me like a child. She has one great staff member Iliana and she treated her how she treated her patients, horrible. I'm hoping by the time I am writing this she has moved on to something else, I know she was working towards other things. I'd also like to thank her for her support, kindness, and she was able to give me direction that the doctor could not. Communication was difficult and she was extremely invalidating. She wasn't willing to adequately help with my pain. I was in a rough spot after a cross country move. I'm feeling so much better now. And I came to find at my new practice that along with my back pain I had a very sick gallbladder that needed removal. The organ was actually dead. So yes, I was experiencing immense amounts of back pain. She chose to not believe me. It's hard enough being a pain patient. The stigma is real. So if you are a pain patient looking for a new doctor? I highly recommend you going elsewhere. Her own staff told me she was ""crazy"" and not providing appropriate care and for my own safety? To go elsewhere. That says A LOT.|Dr Hashim was so much help for my low back pain. She is so attentive and very available. I wish I had delt with her to begin my treatments.|Dr. Hashim has been my doctor for over a year. She is very caring and really listens to you. She really thinks about what problems you are having and will try everything possible to help you with your pain. I would definitely recommend her to anyone that has been dealing with chronic pain. There is no other doctor I would want to handle my care. Her office staff is also very friendly and love the changes they have made to the office.|I've been seeing Dr. Hashim for several years and I've been very happy with my care. I've had chronic pain and other health issues that makes my pain hard to control sometimes. Dr. Hashim always listens to me, and with her help we've found ways to control my pain with minimal medication. She's strict and expects patients to follow her rules, but with all the abuse in the news I don't blame her. I've been very happy with my care and will continue to see Dr. Hashim in the future.|Dr. Hashim is the BEST! She's very thorough & thoughtful. She gives great advice and if you listen, you will have pain relief for sure. I'm so grateful I switched to her.|Dr. Hashim is a caring and supportive doctor. She's mindful and is knowledgeable of important regulations regarding prescription drugs. Though some patients might be less understanding in the importance of keeping track of prescription drugs, it doesn't bother me. I consider the counting of meds prescribed by Dr. Hashim invaluable. This keeps me safe from potential harm from them. Drug screening through random urine tests is a key in keeping transparency and honesty as a patient.

This can cause delays of a day or more due to this process.|He gave me a shot in my spine, and he was joking and laughing with the nurses so much that he missed it,  5 days later I was screaming in severe pain and had to be rushed to an emergency room out of state.

The last few trips to your office haven't been satisfactory. After my appointment today, when I got in my car, I just busted out crying. Being in pain 24 and 7 isn't fun. It's debilitating. But, today I don't know if I want to return until you come back from maternity leave. The nurse that took me back to the room just rushed through my paperwork, she could barely answer my questions because she was so in a rush to get to the next patient. So, she came off as being RUDE. Bottom line no good results came from this visit.  Very disappointing once again!

C.Lee|If I could put zero stars I would. I hardly ever write reviews but I am making the rounds with this one as I would hate if anyone else would ever had to experience what I just had.

Originally the appointment was with Dr. Bush for an epidural injection. I arrived at 10:30 for an 11am appointment. The waiting area was full, which I had no issues with, but was told that Dr. Bush had apparently over booked themselves with appointments. Without any prior warning I was told I would now be seen by the ""owner""' Dr. K (I do not know his last name, it was what the staff called him) who specifically came in to help with the load.

By 11:30 the clinic was beginning to empty, with new patients beginning to be checked in and seen. I go up to the staff and ask if there was an estimated time that I would be seen. I wasn't given any information on when that might be and was only told that they were behind.

I was annoyed given that I am a caregiver that cannot be too long from the house, but decided to wait due to my back pain. Also my pain was currently becoming more severe as I purposely didn't take any medication for the appointment.

By 12:30 I once again go up to the staff and ask what is happening. By this point at least 3 other people have came in checked in and had been seen immediately. The clinic's waiting room was completely empty and I was the only person left.

Another woman came up (I do not know if she was a nurse or not, she didn't even speak to me) and spoke to the front desk staff about my appointment. She then proceeded to tell the front staff who then notified me that my new doctor, Dr. K, had just left to go on his lunch break and would not be back for 45 minutes. As a reminder this man is apparently the owner of this establishment. He also came in to help with the overflow and even though they were an hour and a half late behind and there was no one else waiting besides me, decided that now was a perfect time as any to eat.

To say I felt completely disrespected and disregarded of my pain is an understatement. I decided to cancel and leave instead of wait. I refuse to be touched by any doctor who shows so little respect towards their patients time. The least the staff could have done is say please come back this afternoon or send someone to explain why things were so behind. Instead I was left sitting at the waiting area looking like a fool while no one said a thing and would probably still be sitting there had I not asked any questions.

I am a believer that good doctors take care of their patients from check in to check out. I have been to enough doctor appointments with both of my parents to see that there is almost always a direct correlation to how doctors' manage their patients and time, to how they behave professionally and their ability to treat patients.

If they are willing to disregard their patients in this way, how can you expect them to take care of your condition.|Please beware of Dr. Bush! I have been a patient of Dr. Nodine's for over a year and then I had a hip replacement and I loved her. She was terrific. After that surgery my back pain became more significant so I set an appointment to see her again. The day of my appointment the front desk contacted me and told me I would be seeing Dr. Bush. From the moment this woman stepped into the exam room I was treated like garbage. She kept interrupting me. Dismissed what i was trying to tell her about my pain. Barely did an exam and then brushed me off by saying I need physical therapy. I have been managing my back pain for ten years - I have tried everything and I tried to tell her that and she dismissed me. I just wanted to get out of there so I left - in tears. Fast forward 6 months and my back pain was worse so once again I attempted to see Dr. Nodine. I called and made an appointment. Drove 45 minutes and waited 20 minutes only to be pulled into an office and told Dr. Bush had discharged me and they had no idea how I got an appointment. I didn't even know what that meant and the lady said - didn't you get a letter and I said no and asked for a copy but was told the ""printer"" was down or something. She explained it basically meant Dr. Bush fired me as a patient and I couldn't return or five years. Once again - I left in tears. I will be taking every single available action against the unprofessional, abusive manner in which Dr. Bush treated me - so beware if your scheduled with her. She is the nastiest most unprofessional person I have ever met.|I love this location. I was considerably late due to vehicle issues and they still managed to fit me in and without any wait!!! They really care about each person and I don't feel like just a number to make someone money like most pain management facilities. Plus my Doctors awesome!!!!|The Physicians, Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, and the Administrative/Front Desk Team are all incredibly kind and understanding.m. This team of skilled healthcare professionals will treat you with patience and professionalism and will genuinely care for your overall well-being. It will be difficult to find a team that is more well-rounded or more suited to care for you and your healthcare needs. I highly recommend this facility and its staff to anyone in need of long-term pain management.|I would like to clone Dr. Gordon!
I have been seeing Dr. Gordon since we moved here a few years ago. He has found a plethora of ways to treat my chronic pain. I have a good understanding of the treatment plan and the limitations.
As a side note - I think his job would be a tad bit easier if this state legalized medical Marijuana!|I have a new issue with them now unfortunately.  Dr Tolbert canceled my appointment with for 11/21/24 and I was told to reschedule. Now Dr Tolbert knew my Rx were going to run out on the 23rd but didn't bother to tide me over. I rescheduled for the 25th which was the only opening before Thanksgiving. I saw Shay that day and I had told her I had run out and she put a new Rx in while I was sitting there. I checked with Kroger in Bloomington the next morning and it hadn't gone though. I called Greenwood and the staff member told me she would send Shay a msg. and call me back. She never called as usual. I checked Wednesday late afternoon and it hadn't gone thru again. I have been left without medication for the last 5 days. I'm in severe and going thru withdrawl. This isn't right to treat a patient like this.  I called at 0815 hrs. this morning and of course no one answered and it is now 1000 hrs. and I still haven't heard from them. I can't go another day like this and shouldn't have to. This is patient neglect!|The surgery center (that conducts nerve blocks) is in the same building as the doctors, physical therapist, and imaging, yet unlike everything else, it is NOT in network for UHC. Even though office staff assured me it was in network, it is not, and I was charged thousands for a nerve block. In addition, there were multiple billing errors for physical therapy which they refuse to own up to, despite my insurance company agreeing they were in error.

During this time they almost injected a corticosteroid into the wrong hip. Had I been put under, they would have. I was the one that notified them of their mistake.

Vanessa during my last visit, argued with me, about me having Osteoartharitis of the hip. She said ""you have mild DJD"". Trying to dismiss my pain. Vanessa doesn't know Osteoartharitis is also known as...Degenerative Joint Disease, or DJD for short.

I have multiple pain sources, verified by advanced imaging and by an orthopedic surgeon. They acted as if I was drug seeking the entire time. I must've been a pretty dumb one for denying anesthesia for every single procedure.

When I was sent to physical therapy, they ordered the wrong thing. Not even remotely close to my pain source.

This place is beyond unprofessional. I should've known when they called me prior to any paperwork or meeting me when they said ""we wont give painkillers because your charge from 2018"". The phone staff huffs and puffs if you have questions. These people are not passionate about helping.

They legitimately just looked me up on mycase. Had they actually went further than their bias they'd see all those charges were dropped. Beyond that, I requested more help than what they were giving me and stated I did not want opioids. I had 0 pain relief from this place. Most these reviews are fake or have relations with the staff.

I'm a union brother through and through. I have no reason to lie. If you value yourself, or your family members. Do not come here. Read the other 1 star reviews. This place is a malpractice suit waiting to happen.|My visit to the Centers for Pain Control and Vein Care was a pleasant surprise.

Lisa truly is very concerned / committed to LISTENING and CARING, to what I have to say and has been a huge help to me over the years, following a chronic issue I have been living with and most likely, will have to continue with for the rest of my life.

Everyone there is so friendly, from reception, to nursing, to care givers / doctors, everyone.
I Always see a smile when I walk in. ALWAYS !

The staff works very hard to schedule my appointments to fit around my work schedule

With the recent pharmaceutical shortages, I have experienced my pharmacy having no availability of prescriptions a few times - Commonwealth Pain New Albany, quickly rerouted my prescription to another pharmacy which did have availability.

In all fairness / honesty ...
When calling in for something - calls seem to get routed to Louisville
My level of satisfaction - not very good.
I wish the company would allow phone calls to go through to the office I visit instead of routing me through (what feels like) an answering service.
I have never received an answer to any issue or question I had - - I always get the same response of, I will forward your question / concern, to the staff.
(( as I said - feels like an answering service ))
> use the portal for the quickest response <
You will hear back in a VERY short time

Phone in service - 2 star|On my second visit, they rescheduled me via voicemail, and when I was 9 minutes late to the new assigned time they refused to see me, saying it was 12 minutes and their policy is 10, and no exceptions apparently for canceling my original appointment and expecting me to be available at the new time. This was a Friday when my rx was due, and because of a 3 minute difference they had no problem that I will be in pain for 3 days until yet another appointment time.

However, I was never once told I had ever failed a screen until I went in for my regular appointment, and it wasn't until I was taken into the room and waited for the doctor to come in and she informed me I would have to find a new place to go for pain management because I could no longer go there... I do think  I don't really remember, but I think she did give me my medication 1 more time.  I have since found a new place and really like them a lot better, and they're more professional and care more about their patients.",physical_therapy|thorough_care|pain_management_services|extended_hours|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|comfortable_waiting_area|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|board_certified_physicians|medication_management|injection_treatments|good_doctors|efficient_service,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ_UB17IRuaYgRb_EB5urvFO0,310

When I met with the doctor, he took the time to thoroughly review my medical history before asking about any concerns. He didn't rush through the appointment but listened carefully and answered all of my questions with clear, thoughtful explanations.
After the appointment, he provided me with additional resources and even followed up a week later to check on my progress. It was refreshing to feel heard and genuinely cared for in a medical setting.|If I could I would give them -10. These are suppose to be pain specialist, I have a broken back and a shattered ankle, but dr. Dasari acted like I was somehow not the right kind of person to recieve treatment. My question is well then who i?. Because I suffer from chronic pain, I somehow have done something wrong? Everyone cannot have surgery, or afford surgery. I was treated like some kind of criminal. From the time he came in the room, Dr. Dasari was condescending, and short, and rude. They are suppose to treat pain, but if you are african american don't expect to get prescribed any medication to relieve your pain and suffering. But if you are Indian or Caucasian you will get everything you need to feel better. Yes I am African american, and I am a big guy. The doctor was absolutely judging me from the time he laid eyes on me. Don't judge a book by its cover. I am a college graduate, who is a single father, and care taker for my senior mother who had a stroke. For some reason Dr. Dasari feels like my mri that shows my back is broken and herniated disconnected two places among other things is not valid because it is a few years old. That doesn't change the fact that it is in fact very painful and worsening. So he gets paid, to tell me nothing I can do sorry.. goodbye.   All I can say is WOW. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!|It was wonderful to walk in and from the receptionists,n, the E-xray tech, the nurse to the doctor. It made a nervous visit to a calming one. The professionalism is outstanding. Dr. Wallace did great speaking to me, explaining everything to me so that I would.understand. Asking if I had questions without rushing with an answer.
What a group of professionals, you wont be disappointed.|To doctor sherry and his whole crew is one the best medical and loving, kindness place to visit when it comes to caring about there people health. I also would like to say they are a blessing in my life n love too you all.

Mr.Bryd|Everyone I had an interaction with at Midwest Interventional Spine Specialist were so friendly and kind. I was in and out they were very fast, and the staff was very knowledgeable you can tell they've been doing this for awhile.|0 stars should be an option. It took a week to get an appointment. Waited a hour and a half to be told nothing. The actual interaction with the Doctor was 5 minutes and I wasn't listened to. No help at all|I was extremely unimpressed with this place. Upon arriving for my appointment, I filled out a lot of paperwork but then waited for about an hour past my appointment time. I was eventually seen by the Dr. and medical assistant (Who were great!) for about 15 minutes.... I then had to wait another 30 minutes because they had not received something from my referring doctors office, which I'm amazed wasn't caught prior to my appointment. I then saw the doctor for another 3 minutes or so, and injections were scheduled. After receiving a call from the surgical center doing the injections, I had second thoughts and wanted to get in contact with the doctor again to discuss if there were any other options for me as none were discussed with me at the visit, despite being there for almost 3 hours. I was told (very rudely) by someone at MISS that I could not communicate with the doctor, etc, without coming in for another appointment. I thought it was a little strange I couldn't have open communication with the Dr. I explained I had literally just had the appointment and nothing was discussed with me, and if there truly were no other options for me I would do the injections. Eventually, I received a call back from someone (very nice, understanding and helpful!) who scheduled me for another appointment with the Dr. the morning of the injections so I could discuss any other options I had prior to moving forward with the injections, which was helpful! However, fast forward to the day of the appointment and injections (Which I took off of work for!) I received a call a few hours before my appointment stating that the Dr. was ill and my appointment needed to be cancelled. I called back because I still had the procedure scheduled at 2pm! I left a message and after an hour no one had called me back. I called again and spoke with someone who said my appointment for the injections needed to be cancelled as well because the Dr. appointment and injections scheduled in the same day (by someone in their office!) was not approved by my insurance because it was all in one day. This was the first I was hearing of this! No one had told me anything about this issue with my insurance prior, and I feel like I would not have known if I didn't call myself. So now I have taken a whole day off of work to have everything canceled like an hour or so before my appointment. I liked Dr. Woods and the assistant, but the scheduling area needs some serious help with organization. I am also a medical receptionist and I am not a fan of how they handled this. I canceled all future appointments as I do not have time for a doctor's office that does not respect MY time.|Loved the receptionist's at the front desk they were very patient and professional and Dr. Shetty he was so nice and took his time and listened to me and understood what was going on immediately!

Dr Patel informed me of a back brace promotion going on by the company and they are distributing FREE braces. Because it was suppose to be FREE I informed him that I would try it. Upon receiving I knew, without opening, that it would not work and returned it one week later.  Turns out they placed $64 on my account for the FREE brace and in addition billed my insurance company in excess of $7,000 of which they got over $700, again, for a FREE brace. Billing is telling me I signed a non-refundable medical device agreement. OK, but it was suppose to be FREE. I am still dealing with them on this matter.|Dr Patel is an amazing doctor and he explained everything in a way that my husband and I could understand what was going on with my body. The staff at the front desk is also so friendly, patient, and professional. Maria who works reception on the surgery side made the process go so smooth and she made my day for being so kind and gentle when coming in for surgery!! She is truly amazing and is the perfect person for patients coming in for surgery and they see her smile and how kind she is to all patients!!

We have sent people to APAC with problems other than hers and they have very good things to say also.|I just had another procedure today. Needless to say I was taken care of by the BEST PAIN DOCTOR IN CROWN POINT AND DYER. Dr.Patel and his team at the surgery center are amazing. Maria, is the most amazing person I have met.

Went very well, will see if my situation improves. I'm on my second/third part of my procedure now. Very professionally. Unfortunately as I go thru community care from VA, the process is slower. I'm finally showing some progress not a lot but I've had this done 6-7 times at VA with little to no help. APAC center for Pain Management are  from the nursing staff to Dr. Patel himself. Would recommend them to anyone needing care.|I am so grateful for everything. APAC, Dr. Sheel Patel in Crown Point are amazing. The quality of life is coming back to me. With the treatment that was designed for me. I can not express how much gratitude is in my heart. Baby steps|I thought Dr. Patel was a very caring doctor until I needed to speak to him in regards to an epidural I was having and when I told the specialist which nerve it was, he said oh no, he needs to do this nerve so I went to the office to see if I could talk to Dr. Patel about this before my appointment at the surgery center, and Gail and Dori would not let me speak to him said he does not do that and that I would have to make another appointment And cancel my procedure at that point I had had enough of Gail and Dory and their attitudes. I thought this office was going to be different and caring, but you are just another number. And an insurance payment after that day, I never went back|I'm happy to have Dr.Patel and his team/staff in my medical care life. From the moment I started with Dr.Patel I felt safe. I appreciate their approach to my needs. I would recommend APAC 
It's 2 years later and I NO LONGER feel safe with Dr Patel's staff at the dyer location. When I saw the reviews score at a 2.3 NOW I know why. All of the young girls that work at this location is low quality. Especially Cleo. When I first saw Cleo from the set it off movie working I was shocked and appalled. Too much estrogen for me and Dr Patel will continue to loose great patients due to his unprofessional, untrained staff. I know good help is hard to find.

She explained things clearly and was understanding of me not wanting to go through more surgeries. I'm grateful to have met her. I needed someone with her qualities in that moment, as that day was a really rough day for me.|dr Shabandar's office has turned into a nightmare ever since he merged. I literally waited in the waiting room for 30 minutes for them to call me up and to reschedule me because I was too late for my appointment!!!! I got there five minutes before my appointment was supposed to start!!!  Then they told me that they didn't refill my pain pills because I had to give a urine sample...they could've told me that three weeks ago when I was here but instead they made me wait! I wish just one time one of these people could deal with the pain that I deal with on a daily basis and then they would know what it's like to not have something to make the pain go away!

I had an appointment yesterday and at an hour past my appointment time, I went to the desk and let them know I could not sit any longer and I had another appointment to get to, and the doctor still took forever to get to me.  The check out process is FOREVER!  They definitely need better chairs if people are going to wait for so long.  The staff are rude.  One called me the evening before my appointment and told me she was going to cancel it because I never started PT....i have been in PT for two months now and she continued arguing with me over it.  I would only recommend Dr. Shahbandar.  He listens and actually knows what he's doing!!|The Doctor was personable & showed concern for my medical conditions.

Dr. Rutledge is a wonderful doctor - Great listener, takes things seriously, very personable guy. The nurse practitioner (Amy, or Anne?) is new, but is also wonderful. Very caring, great listener, amazing at her job.
My complaint is with the office staff and how horribly they handle just about everything. My wife just had major surgery not too long ago, and is on a VERY high dose of pain medication - today, 30 minutes before her appointment (we are over half way there), they call and say they no longer accept her insurance, that she's had since October. It is mid January. I watched my wife hand over her new insurance card to them in October, to which no one said I thing about them not accepting it. I have walked into places myself, handed my card over, and been immediately told that place doesn't accept my insurance more than once, why did the person working up front not know that the facility she worked at did not take that insurance? Seems very unprofessional to me. So now, my wife has no medication, and no doctor (she will be in chronic pain the rest of her life), because of a mistake they made. Pretty big mistake if you ask me.
Not only this - But right after she had major surgery, her surgeon sent over paperwork that was incredibly important for them to look at, somehow it didn't make its way to the doctor, and neither did the notes of my wife calling and asking them to please look at those papers and respond. After a week, I drove an hour up there to be told that someone just simply didn't send any of that information back to her doctor, it just sat there, and it took the woman one second to do it. She sat without pain medication for days, after getting cut wide open just a few days prior. Another pretty big mistake if you ask me.
Not long before that, we showed up to her appointment, were told she had no appointment. Yes she did. We had the appointment card proving it. Someone didn't put it in, their mistake. After going back and forth with the front desk people and standing firm, they did allow her to be seen, but pushed pretty hard for her to just leave due which I felt was a bit inconsiderate and unprofessional.
The doctors at this place are amazing - But whoever handles the rest of the stuff honestly just needs fired. They all do. This is a *pain* clinic. You can't just screw people over and mess with their lives like that and act like it is a little mistake. I do understand what's done is done, but dang. I sure hope no one else is dealing with anything similar from this place, no human should suffer due to another's mistake, it is incredibly sad.|So let me get this straight,  after my appointment with the doctor,  I approach the reception/ nurse area and ask if there is a copay i need to take care of. She replied no. 2 weeks later, I get a bill for $80.00. I cancel my next appointment because I was in California at the time and I get another bill for $75.00. . So now my bill totals $155.00.  From this point,nothing really makes sense,  so I wait to hear from you guys and that never happens. Next, today,  I'm being contacted by the Paragon collection agency. Now considering that I don't owe anybody, it couldn't be anyone  else but your office who has turned me over to collection. U asked all the right questions, made all the right moves, you charge me for an appointment that I canceled and turn me over to collections with even once attempting  to contact me? That doesn't seem right|Thanks to Dr. Rutledge & his staff for their patience, knowledge & understanding in making my visits pleasant & for helping me find a way forward in managing the pain I've had for a very long time.|I couldn't tell you what the doctor was like because I never got to see him! I sat in the room for an hour and 23 minutes waiting. They don't value patients they value their own pockets.|As the spouse, I am grateful for the care Dr. Rutledge has given my husband. He is a skilled doctor who conveys his concern by listening and reaching a decision that best suits my husband's needs. The doctor manages my husband's arthritic pain, enabling him to participate in those aspects of life he values.|I've never treated so rude by a doctor in 70 years of my life! I work in the Medical field also. Doctor Kim or doctor I don't care didn't even come all the way in the room. Half in the door with his computer. Never introduced his self or asked me how was doing. First words out of his mouth was I don't think I can take you as patient! Because of the dosage I was taking from the last pain clinic I went to for 8 years. When I tried to tell him of all the things that I had been through. He stated,"" I don't care what you been through!"" I've have had 3 lower back surgeries and 2 extensive neck surgeries. Cancer in which radiation damage my lower colon for life. Not going into the other surgeries I've had. I need knee replacement surgery in which I'm trying to put off. After being insulted he just left. I needed not help instead of feeling like a nobody!|I had back surgery a little over a year ago and I am in worse pain now than before I had it. I found Center For Pain Medicine online. I called and was assigned to Dr. Hom. He was very understanding of the pain I'm in and provided me with pain medicine to help me try to get through each day as best I can. I appreciated how kind Dr. Hom was and how he listened to me. The receptionist and nurses are also very sweet. I am so glad I went to the Center For Pain Management.|I am a Nurse and have professionally met many pain management Doctors.  I however on a personal level this Pain Management office and Dr. Rutledge have absolutely always made me feel respected and a part pr deciding my care.  Dr Rutledge does not push pain medication as my only option and talks to me as a person about potential medication and treatment procedure options.  He is very down to earth and makes you feel very comfortable.  My first personal experience with pain management place and as a Nurse and a person with chronic pain I was appalled at how I was treated.   I highly ensure that you will never be treated like a drug seeker with Dr Rutledge and any of the Nurse Practitioners, Medical Assistants, and office administration.

I don't know how they deal with their cosmetic fiscally efficient clients.

Maybe the patients that are paying more so they can have pretty legs, have not been through serious injury, and/or pain patients that have significant income disagree with me.

Right now the primary doctor is on vacation for a month and I was not offered any alternative temporary pain remedies while waiting for Dr. Ho to return from his pleasure at my cost.

The staff, however, is wonderful. But for a simple question about anesthesia, the staff seemed too afraid of there own boss to make an important thirty second call to him during business hours. Almost like they would face extreme wrath or unemployment if they disturbed him for even one minute.

Dr. Ho has amazing manual dexterity and precision. Even though his expertise seems to be going to his head; he has a wonderful staff and is great in surgery.|All the nurses are super friendly & knowledgeable: from the intake exam person to the ultrasound tech to the team who did the procedure.

Thank you so much!  Christy Kersey has a great bedside manner.  She did my procedure & follow up & everything went so well.  Would recommend to others for sure.|A ""pain clinic"" that refuses to help with your pain ! The only way they know how to deal with pain is to stab you in the spine with needles !

Before I moved to Florida I was a patient there for a good while, they're kind, compassionate and thorough. They DO NOT FALSIFY urine drug tests, if you fail it's because you tested dirty, period!! I've had no problems with my tests because I was clean, period.  If you follow the rules and their pain management guidelines, there will be no issues.|I really enjoyed this clinic. I am sad that they close down and since they close. D, my doctor refuses to fill my scripts. And his clinics sent me to the wrong clinic and I have been in pain since this place. I filled my script last. I really miss having my doctor that I had here. He did a knee injection on me and it was awesome. I didn't hurt all day or anything the way he did. It was amazing. And I really wish they would come back|I've had to deal with pain doctors the past two years. Some who were forcing injections/pain pumps/various forms of surgery without looking at my patient profile. Not the case here. Dr. D actually reads his patients files ahead of time. He's blunt and straight to the point, which I appreciate greatly. He won't push anything unless it's absolutely medically needed, but he will give his advice and directions up front. Three doctors later, I'm glad I found one that has empathy enough to read my profile (which is rare) and actually be straight forward to the point without beating around the bush. Thank you guys again! I greatly appreciate your whole team more than you know.|So I went here before Covid and last visit in 2021. I'm a happy go lucky person that's nice to everyone until you piss me off.
Well I got along with everyone at this clinic, I made them all masks and everything.
When I got my last pain injection I had a headache for 2 weeks straight, no breaks in the pain. Then my blood pressure shot up and I had a seizure, which I've never had before.
When asking Dr. Provenza, of course he denied doing anything wrong.
Well since I confronted him with my problems and concerns, he ""discharged"" me for inappropriate behavior.
This here proofs his wrongdoing to me.
Found this out today and now that he has passed away, he can't justify his actions and lie about my ""behavior""
He wasn't the only shady doctor there, they fired the other one that was prescribing medication that actually helped me instead of covering the pain.
If you want pain meds and don't want to fix your pain, this is the place to go, they give it out like candy.|I'm just gonna ECHO MiaX. She pretty much had my experience before I ever went there. They called me for a pill count on the 23rd of December 2023. I informed them when they called I was out of town. The ""nurse"" that called me said you need to be here before 5 pm on that 23rd day. Again, out of town. She told me bother coming back, and said it's my fault I'm not|I went to see these people. I was hit by a semi in 2007. I've had neck problems ever since plus I've had other accidents that further damage my spine. I've had all types of treatments for my pain. When I went to see them, they had my x-rays and limited medical records. They spent 20 minutes telling me what they wouldn't do for me. Neither Dr Doraswamy or his nurse ever ask me anything about previous treatment or anything else.  They judged me and decided what they would do before ever even seeing me. Had they asked they'd have known that their recommendations had failed in the past for me. Don't waste your time,  they an inadequate office. If you really need pain treatment, find a different place because they don't care or listen to you.|These people are rude disrespectful and uneducated knew nothing of my medical history and did not actually refused to do their job. Dr didn't want to prescribe meds unless agreed to injections and the women upfront tell him what to do . This place and their staff are shady|Dr. Brian is amazing I have seen him for a few years now. He's such a awesome person. Has worked with me through alot this past year. My year has been a nightmare. He always understood and threats me like a person.

After receiving three epidurals and ongoing pain management treatment, I can confidently say that today, my had been relived! Dr. Ring and his team have been compassionate, professional, and truly dedicated to my care. They took the time to listen to my concerns and provided a treatment plan that made a real difference in my quality of life. I highly recommend Dr. Ring and his staff to anyone in need of pain management. They have been a lifesaver for me!|I am blown away by the exceptional care I received from Dr. Cawley and the entire team! From the moment I walked in, I was treated with kindness, compassion, and professionalism.

Dr. Cawley is a true expert in his field. He took the time to thoroughly understand my back pain issues and developed a personalized treatment plan that has made a significant difference in my life.

The entire staff, including the other doctors and workers, were friendly, attentive, and made me feel at ease throughout my visits. The office is clean, modern, and well-organized, which further added to my positive experience.

I have struggled with back pain since my car accident, but thanks to Dr. Cawley and his team, I am now experiencing significant relief and improved mobility. Their dedication to providing top-notch care is evident in everything they do.

The office staff is helpful and Dr. Ring and my chiropractor there were very understanding of my pain after suffering many years with migraines and also after a neck surgery. I feel they are passionate about helping people who truly need help with quality of life care.|Great office! Friendly,  professional,  easy parking,  they evaluated me,  gave me a procedure the same day,  prescribed medicines including a muscle relaxant,  anti inflammatory,  and some medicine for pain,  ordered an MRI,  did therapy,  all in the same day.   The doctors and Nurses were very knowledgeable and explained a lot to me.   I am happy my doctor referred me to this office!|Good experience here. There is a bit of a wait time with this place, which is a definite area for improvement, but otherwise I think these guys are great.
Can't speak to previous reviews - but I have been here twice and the staff have been friendly and courteous on both occasions.
I came in for epidural injections both times, and each visit has left me feeling better and better.
Dr Ring is great. Very personable, funny and puts you at ease with what has to be done. His nurses assistant Chastity (? - sorry, I was on drugs when you told me your name) is also great. The anastestesiologis Robin and Carleen were also great.
I see Dr O at the Fullerton location, but he is also top notch.
Great experience all round. I would and have recommended these people.|Have been going here for pain management for nearly a year and everything about my experiences there has been a nightmare. I started going there to treat a bulged disc. This required chiropractic treatment and pain medication. As several months passed my pain was no getting better so Dr Ring suggested a procedure to relieve the pain. The day of that procedure, while I was waiting, Dr Ring and a patient got into an argument which eventually led to the police being called. I ended up walking out rather than go ahead with the procedure fearing he wasn't in the right state if mind after dealing with the police. I should never have gone back but the pain was getting worse, so I finally committed to having the procedure done. What a mistake that was. I am now in more pain then before and its almost unbearable now. Obviously I have a lot of questions to ask him but he never returns my calls and his staff just makes excuses for him. Making appointments is also a joke. I always made an appointment so Im the first one he sees, yet every time I go I have to wait a minimum of 45 minutes and several times as much as an hour and a half. Everyone there seems to be completely disorganized too. Bottom line is you should do your homework before you place your well-being into someone's care and trust your instincts when you see or feel that something just isn't right. Overall this has been one of the worst experiences of my life and I still haven't resolved my pain issue either.|This place is very unprofessional. They charge for services and orthotics that were not rendered. This office does nothing but push pills on their patients. The therapy and chiropractic services is a joke too. I hope the medical board and insurance companies begin investigating  this fraudulent company. And no I'm not disgruntled because ""I didn't get what I wanted."" I'm not an addict, never was and that's why this joke of a place wasn't for me. They want addicts here so you don't question their fraudulent billing and idiotic treatments.

My 72 year old Mother  has been going here for almost a year. She has urinary issues and a history of UTIs. We have had to take her to get blood work at some point because she couldn't give a urine sample. This is not a big deal.  Her last appt (we didn't know it yet) Dr Chad Hemmer berated her like a child in front of staff and other clients. Telling her they have had this issue with her before. ""She has 30 mins to pee and if she can't do that then she has broken contract and will no longer be able to come.""  I reminded him that her UTI issues is part of her diagnosis and offered to go have labs done. He refused, stating that that's unneeded work to be done for something she knows she has to do. He also made it clear she was making them late to lunch. He dismissed  her from the program with nothing to sign or other information. Horrible treatment. He talked to her and I both like berated children for something that wasn't her fault. I will be writing a letter to the Attorney General's office. If you can help it. Don't go here.|The ONLY reason I'm even giving them two stars is for their physical therapy department and Julie. The front staff is rude and I've been going there for almost a year now and I have NEVER received a phone call back from them. The last time I went in to get referred to a different surgeon because the one they referred me to wouldn't see me, as there was another doctor in my wrist after that doctor, I walked in to see a man that I've never seen before. Dr. Dunham, and at the end of it, he basically told me that there was nothing they could (would) do for me and refused to send over a referral to another surgeon ""because that's not a responsibility I want"" and refused to fill the controlled medication they wrote the scripts for throughout the past year. He didn't give me a weaning dosage, no side effects to watch out for. Nothing. He didn't even give me the simple courtesy of telling me they would no longer see me until I asked if I needed to make a follow up appointment and his response was ""no"". No explanation, nothing. It's been a week and I've called every day to request copies of my medical records and I haven't received a phone call back. It was a fantastic place to go, until the front office staff changed and the environment shifted. And from what I've seen on these reviews, I'm not the only person they've done this to.|Dr Dave was the most attentive doctor I have ever seen. He actually listened to me and wanted to know my game plan so we actually had a great conversation. Everyone's quick to leave bad reviews but he deserves a shoutout for being great !

However, I'm very upset because I've tried to get PAs for my scripts and I can't get anyone to answer the phone or send them in after waiting 48 hours.|Been getting my pain management for a few years now and up until 10/18/2022 I've never been so discussed with any care provider in my life!! James Julie and Amber are all compassionate and care about getting the pain under control! But that Dave Durham is a complete bully and uses his powers as owner to control and put people down!

A straight bully!|I just got out of hospital on a Friday and they are closed!! They had sent my script to where I told them to days ago, but they haven't had any. Tried to get a hold of them to send it to a different pharmacy that I have already checked on.  And they are closed! Now I'll have to go to the ER, (ED), all weekend 3 times a day. This is crazy. They do need to care more for their patients,  but I believe they're hands are tied to some extent. That said, they should at least be open 5 days a week.|Very compassionate employees. Both nurse practitioners Amber and Julie  are both knowledgeable in the chronic pain field.  The physical therapists are good too. I have only been itoDr Bogus once, but she did a very good on my epidural injection.|I would give this place 0 stars if possible. I had been going here for 2 years and on my final appointment( didn't know it yet) a random dr who said he was the owner told me my insurance is requesting my records and he isn't going to deal with it, then said I failed a UDS in FEB. He cut my meds down and told me to report him because he doesn't care. I did injections, PT, never missed an appt and bam! He was so demeaning and refused to explain or answer my questions.

He is also very skilled at doing many different types of procedures designed to lower your pain levels in general, and sometimes the results can be dramatic reductions. I would recommend Dr. Kim to anyone who needs help managing chronic pain as he is one of the best doctors I've seen for this.|Dr. Kim is nothing but a pill pusher.  At my first visit (10 minutes) he didn't touch me to examine the areas I have pain.  His main focus was that I was Ativan.  He gave me six months to go off of it, but did prescribe hydrocodone.  If it is really that dangerous, why would he give me six months to go off.  At my following appointment he spent about three minutes with me to tell me when I could pick up my prescription at the pharmacy.  The waiting room was like a herd with over flow into another room.  I came to Dr. Kim through referral.  I guess I'm all you want is pain medicine, he may be ""wonderful"", but I wanted help with my pain without having to use pain meds.  I do not recommend this doctor to anyone!!|I have severe neuropathy in my feet, legs, and hands for the first time in 20 plus years the pain is under control. Dr. Kim is personable timely and efficient, Have never waited more than 10 minutes to be called back to be seen. If you're living with severe or constant pain I recommend you see Dr. Kim|I've lived with debilitating fibromyalgia for 20plus years
I've been to an endless amount of doctors. I've had endless amounts of different kinds of treatments and NOTHING ever worked
so somehow I found Dr. Kim and on my first visit with him. I told him that what I wanted him to do was to disconnect my head from my spinal cord so I would quit feeling pain
He said that he could not do that but that he had something else that would work for me that didn't involve narcotics and I'm in recovery so that's important
So a spinal cord stimulator by Boston scientific, it was placed in back
I woke up from surgery vibrating, and have not had fibromyalgia pain since
It's the ONLY thing that EVER worked
Life Saving!!!!!!
The whole team at his office, including Boston  Scientific have been wonderful to work with

They should stop giving pain pills and narcotics Two people that are suffering and make the spinal cord stimulator the first option
It's incredible|Terrible front staff they'll turn you away from the window if you don't have your patient information filled out. Terrible availability, after they denied me service they offered to see me in a month as a new patient even though I've been going there for about 5 years just wasn't able to see him last year due to unavailable insurance. When and if Dr.Kim is able to see you he interacts with you quickly really doesn't give you time to sit and talk with him and express your concerns accurately and makes you feel rushed.|I was referred to the center for a pain pump. I got assigned him even though I was referred to a specific doctor. Well this doctor comes up with the idea to use a spinal cord simulator, which in the appointment with the sales rep to ask question I was given a pamphlet and pushed to schedule a trial. From my own research I figured out it wasn't going to work which other specialist have agreed. But the worse part was he done a caudil block on me. I was to be ""sedated"" and wouldn't remember anything. I remember well because I wasn't fully numb when he done whatever. I asked him to stop numerous times and he continued going. I never got any relief and in fact my legs since then have hurt as if I was post op for a spinal surgery. So whatever he done increased my leg pain. Had he read my chart or operative report he would have known it was a bad idea to try anything like that. He also doesn't wash his hands between patients as I watched him walk patient to patient in the surgery center and never even sanitize his hands. I spent almost 6 months trying to reach someone to be able to switch to the doctor I was originally referred to. I also requested a call from the office manager no one called back.|Worst experience of any specialist I've ever seen, unfortunately I've seen too many due to other health issues. My first visit was maybe 10min in length with Dr Kim. Most of the time spent with him telling me his rules. I've been on Norco due to chronic pain and he wanted me to try a different med to see if it worked better. I don't have an issue with trying something different, however I have been prescribed his recommended medication to be taken along with Norco. He would have known this IF he would've actually spent time with me or read my well documented file. On top of this, I am self pay due to being out of work for surgery. I paid 75$ the day of my visit and then got a bill for 929.00$ ..... WHAT??? After over 15 calls talking to the billing and office staff, nobody could explain the charge. When it's.coded as an advanced visit, even their billing tops out mid 700$ range. In order to bill 99204 or 99205 the Dr is required to spend 45min to one hour WITH the pt. NOT 10min total. I am scheduled to have a follow up visit 9 days after the initial visit and even after expressing my concerns and leaving 5 unanswered voice mails Dr Kim only prescribed 7 days worth. I have done tons of research and am engaged to a cancer nurse, who deals with specialty charges and codes (all the same in Indiana) I have notified my RA Dr who sent me to Dr Kim and they find what I have encountered completely unacceptable AND against the oath taken by all Dr's. Even to the point of filing charges against the office and the Dr with the medical review board. They obviously DON'T care about their patients, keeping them informed or the quality of care they give.  I have sooo many more things I could write, including facts to back them up, but this is long winded enough. I am a retired FF/Medic so I understand and believe in excellent pt care. Please do not accept this office to help you or your loved ones. I know my RA Dr's office won't refer anyone else to them.....nor will the other Dr's in her office. I truly hope you all have your needs taken care of and that you have or find a Dr's office who actually cares. Have a blessed day.|I am giving this ""doctor"" for lack of better terms, a 0 rating. My wife went in to discuss an issue with her hand and all he did was look at her medication chart and told her he would NOT be filling both of her medications and that she had to pick one or the other. When she tried to verify what she said, he yelled at her and told her she was not listening. This is contradicting to what his video says. Where he says they want to help their patients.

He actually listens and responds.  I value his opinion as he's been honest and easy to talk with.  He doesn't sugar coat the problems he sees with my spine. He also refers me to my Ortho when he feels it's necessary.
When I get the pain injections he explains what he's doing rather than just surprising you with the needle.
His staff is top notch as well.
Not many Drs earn 5 stars with me.  They have to earn it!  Thanks Dr Khan for always having my best back!|Dr. Khan is a phenomenal physician who is very knowledgeable and cares deeply about helping his patients.
This is not your typical ""pain management"" team. They are redefining pain control. Highly recommend.|Sick to my stomach about this.

The one star is not for Dr Khan. I really like him as a doctor, and I'm leaving this review due to his two receptionists. Michelle is one of their names. She is absolutely cold, perhaps the rudest person I've ever spoken to.

We hadn't had any problems before, as her general demeanor gives off a really nasty vibe. I understood to keep my distance/kindness upon check-in at my first appointment years ago.

There is no way to speak to anybody else at the office besides these two, and it is a nightmare literally every time.

I had to reschedule two appointments for one procedure - my ride for the procedure didn't realize they were on eastern time, and the second time was admittedly due to anxiety.

Both times I was reassured that I'd be able to reschedule the appointment without issue. I gave notice. These weren't 'no shows'.

When I went to reschedule the procecure, I received no call back for over 2 weeks, and when I called today for the 4-5th+ time, I was told I'd need to make another office visit in order to have the appointment done since I hadn't called to reschedule. I have left them countless voicemails to reschedule this thing.

Mind you, I've been seeing Dr Khan for over a year, and I have never missed an appointment outside of this. Their office is almost an hour away, and the soonest appointment was about three months away.

That has *never* been the case, and I suspect due to Michelle's tone, she wasn't trying to be helpful. It sounded like she was smiling to give me this news, and I also suspect she rarely smiles generally.

I was then abruptly discharged as a patient over the phone. It caught me off guard as the conversation had been calm (albeit patronizing) before that.

I'm not on any pain medication. I'm not a disgruntled patient who isn't getting their meds filled or what have you. I'm nearly 12 years sober from pain meds, and the reason I go to see Dr Khan is for a physical therapy prescription and epidurals.

I have had bad luck with the medical community as a whole since a very early age, and it takes quite a lot for me to trust a doctor.

Having said all of what I said, I still trust Dr. Khan. He was very kind, we had a good rapport, and I have a strong feeling he would not be happy to hear that I was discharged from his practice.

To the office: I'm willing to delete/edit this review if I'm able to speak to Dr Khan, or someone who isn't Michelle/the other younger receptionist. Otherwise, forget it.

I will be passionately, annoyingly protesting this decision as long as I'm still in pain and discharged.

Dr. Khan = 5 stars (you need new staff)
Receptionists = 0 stars (you need a new job)

Roughly balances out to: stay away from this place. I cannot fathom depending on them for anything related to medication.|Dr Khan is amazing, he fixed my husbands pain 3 years ago, but now cant get anyone to answer the phone or call back. Heaven forbid you keave more than one message. , but a big problem with office staff. They say they'll  call within 24 to 48 hours, took over 3 weeks. They didn't answer the phone, we even had a referral from another doctor. We are changing Dr's because of the rude one. I've read other reviews, others aren't happy either.|In my opinion Doctor Kahn is a wonderful Doctor. He is caring. He asses all situations. He has helped me in so many ways. His nurses are nice. Good to see they change the woman in the office because she was rude.|Doctor and staff are nice.  However they give very short reminder notices for appointments and then charge you $75 if you miss an appointment, even one time.  By short I mean less than three hours one time and less than one hour notice the second time.  I realize I am responsible for my own appointments but sometimes you get overwhelmed, especially when you're dealing with pain and things happen.  That day I was in bed, in pain, slept in and completely missed my appointment.  I was told by one member of the staff it's a ""courtesy"" to get the call, but that short notice isn't very ""courteous"" at all, and I've NEVER gone to a doctor's office of any kind before that didn't give at least a full day's notice.  Even my dog's doctor sends reminders.  It's just bad business to be treated this way.  I also heard while waiting for my turn several others call in just receiving their short notice reminders.  One person I believe said he got a five minute ""courtesy"" call.
Also after being charged that additional $75 I then had to wait just short of TWO HOURS for my appointment.  I should maybe give less stars, but I'm being ""courteous"" as well.  I mean being charged $75 in times like these for an appointment you never had really rubs you the wrong way.|Dr Khan was attentive, kind and caring. Most importantly he was able to come up with an evidence based plan that helped me get better. Highly recommended!|My office visit was on time!
This doesn't always happen at many doctor visits these days.  The staff was friendly and professional as always.
I appreciate Dr. KAHN taking time to ask questions about my pain and lifestyle and then offering suggestions on how i can expect to get the best results .",2024-11-21|2024-11-18|2024-12-05|2024-09-27|2024-01-05|2024-04-05|2024-08-05|2022-12-05,5|5|1|2|5|3|5|5,,,"11 a.m.|1 p.m.|10 a.m.",53|49.6|48,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJnXzWC38TEYgRVsL2W2uYhNo,87

They don't just try to make you a drug addict and depending on it for the rest of your life, they work with you to get you through your issue and develop a plan to hopefully never need the drugs again. They simply seem to care|I can't say enough good things about Dr. Kundi. He is compassionate, kind and understanding. He is very gentle and has done alot to help control my pain.  He gets 5 stars however I have had problems with office staff not returning calls, relaying messages to the doc or answering the phone.|Everyone that works there is Respectful, Kind & Caring.

Truly wonderful people and they're all on it. They all work together to make you feel good as new. There is just so much respect and if i could give more than 5 stars, believe me, I would. I couldn't ask for a doctor with more heart or dedication in his profession. What he does for his patients who struggle every single day out there, is really indescribable. You get more than 110% with Dr Samiullah Kundi. I know I don't ever want to lose him as my doctor.|Dr Kundi is patient oriented. He gives medical options and keeps patients informed.
Dr Kundi makes sure his patients are comfortable with his diagnosis and explains the treatment plan that's understandable for current and future procedures. He is also just always looking out for his patients.|I always enjoy this practice.   I've had many different nurse practitioners and 2 different doctors yet am still pleased.  Usually when I'm forced to see a variety of medical professionals I'm bound to be unhappy,  however; after a couple of years of going here I'm still pleased.  They do listen to you, they are always in a rush, like all medical professionals,  but they will take time to listen if you ask the questions.   They're also empathetic and really try hard to find a solution to whatever you seem to be struggling with at the time.  I definitely recommend this practice and that is saying a lot coming from me!

My appointment was at 2 o'clock. At 1:20 the M.A. called me back, I said i wasn't finished with the paperwork. She acted pissed off. So I tried to read faster and she came back at 1:40. I said I'm so sorry but im still not quite finished. They wanted all your medical background, surgeries, medications, plus I wanted to read all of their rules and stipulations. So I finally was done at 1:50. (Remember my scheduled apt time was 2:00p.m.) So at 2 o'clock on the nose she comes out and says how much longer are you going to be because the doctor says we're going to have to reschedule you! I said, I've been done for 10 minutes. My apt was for 2. I really don't understand why you weren't wanting to give me the full time to READ and sign the paper work. Most of it I just initialed and signed without reading after the second time she came out and got angry. So, my next visit they did the EMG test and found out I have bad neuropathy in my lower extremities. Not news. I've known this for years.
The pain meds the doctor put me on the first visit I noticed I was having some itching on my back, but thought it was unrelated. So, when it was time I got my refill. Then, my face started flushing and started having hives on my back. So I told the doctor doing the test (EMG) I needed to change my medicine. She said ""It's against the law for me (who's a neurologist ) to fill any medication. You'll have to wait to your appointment in 3 weeks)
Now I'm really having bad luck. The following Saturday my husband and I go out shopping and the store on the inside has a step up. I walk with a cane anyway because I have a (foot drop) so I go to step up but my damn left foot didn't make it and I fell. The footage from the store camera looks like I'm doing some kind of gymnastics move. It was so humiliating! But, let me back up a min. Earlier that day I took my remaining meds to my drugstore, I was there anyway, and put them in the box where you can safely get rid of unused meds.
So, I go to ER and I broke my ankle. I call the pain clinic and they said let's get you an earlier appt. So I go, and my doctor says I can't give you anything unless you bring back your unused medications. I said if I'd known that I'd done that. They never gave me time to read my contract.  So now I don't have anything for my broken ankle.|Horrible service! I needed a prior authorization sent to my insurance for an epidural. The problem is that my appointment took place towards the end of Dec 2024, and the prior authorization was sent to my old insurance, not my new insurance plan beginning in January 2025. A representative from my insurance company had me on the line with a front office member in the clinic to provide them with my new insurance information. Two days later, I spoke with my insurance company only to find out the new prior authorization still hasn't been submitted. Now come to think of it, half the time I call this office, I don't get a call back or any follow-up. Honestly, trying to advocate for my care is like pulling teeth with these people.|I absolutely love the people there.Dr kundi, Kat, Ashley, Mo-lo and Mallory. Very caring. Problem I have is I can't get thru their lines for assistance from the actual office. I get a call service who in turns sends a message to the office. I have a matter to speak to them about and called 7 days ago and never received a reply. It seems like my messages are never responded to since this call service took over.
Again, love the staff.|Dr. Vogel is incredible. Smart, patient, kind. Helped me with my migraines when I really needed help. I've been with her over 10 years. Indiana Neurology and Pain Center is a different story. Impossible. I provided insurance 3 times including once leaving it on a recording. My first bill arrived without insurance having been billed. No one answers the -2040 number on the bill. It's a generic voicemail box without ability to leave a message. I emailed billing on 5/17, received a link to pay on 5/20, paid my bill on 5/22. Guess what came today, 6/28? A bill that's 60 days past due. Add dysfunctional to impossible. I'm so mad that I'm leaving a great doctor over an office that is so bad!! This only scratches the surface.|I've been seeing Dr. Kundi for 2 1/2 years now at the East location. Not once have I ever had a problem with him or the staff until today. I have been calling and leaving voicemails on the nurses line for 7 days now. I had to drive there to talk with someone about not being able to get my pain medication filled due to a manufacturer issue. I called every single pharmacy in a 50 mile radius of my home to see if any of them had the amount I need to fill it. No one did. As I get there, I was left standing there at the desk and they could see I was standing there but no one would come to the desk. Finally the young lady working for the other office asked if she could help me. I explained my situation. She goes and gets a nurse. This nurse came at me with such disrespect. I'm trying to explain to her what's happening and I'm crying as I'm in severe pain and can barely stand. I told her I've been calling every day multiple times a day and left numerous voicemails. She cut me off and said that's not possible because we answer our phone and reply to the messages. I said, so basically I'm the liar then? Would you like to see my phone call log? She said to me, "" get rid of your attitude or I will TERMINATE YOU FROM THIS OFFICE""!!!! I seriously had to compose myself before I lost my ish. She tells me we can't be calling pharmacies for you to find drugs for you. You need to do that. I said I have and no one has them. Then she tries to give me a script for a medicine I'm ALLERGIC TO!!! I told her I can't take that. She cops an attitude even more. Well like I said find someone who has pain medicine and we can send it over. Send what over? What medicine am I to ask for? I don't know what Dr. Kundi is willing to let me take! She just kept repeating herself. I go to sit down to call and she is still running her mouth from the window and I said I can't call if you keep talking over what I'm trying to do. She walked away and she never came back to help me. She had the guy at the front desk do it all. I can't believe they allow her to work with patients who have serious medical conditions and chronic pain. When I go to my next appointment I am filing a complaint against her and speaking with Dr. Kundi while he is destroying my lower back nerves to give me some comfort for the excruciating pain I live with. And if she ever speaks to me like I'm beneath her and she's god again or treats me inappropriately in any kind of way, I will not take it. They only reason I'm giving four stars is because everyone is is amazing and treats me fairly and humane. Dr. Kundi has been nothing but professional and caring. I love this place but I seriously despise that woman!

Edit: yesterday Mallory terminated me because she believes I'm on heroine and fentanyl plus other narcotics. If I was, I'd be dead! Never have I ever done those drugs! She wouldn't even let me tell her that one of the ladies dropped my oral swab after it was in my mouth. She said it'll be fine. Guess what it's not fine. She tried to blame it on CBD!!! I believe she's had it out for me ever since the first incident where she wanted to terminate me. 3 years I've been with Kundi, just to be treated like I'm beneath them and I'm a junkie.|Dr. Caryn Vogel is the best neurologist in the city and surrounding area! No wonder so many physicians refer patients to her.  She is so kind and knowledgeable and thorough.  She never rushes me and listens to patients. She's excellent at diagnosing what the problem is! I'm so impressed with her. She deals a lot with neurological issues and is an expert in treating migraines.  Dr Vogel will
Order appropriate tests when medically necessary ! I won't go to any other neurologist and am grateful for her!  You won't find a better neurologist in town ! Thank you Dr Vogel !|After following my doctor here, I'm totally disappointed with the service I've Received and after being hung up on by a MA unwilling to help because she didn't have the answers and is new! I requested a call from a supervisor and 2 days later no response and I'm at a critical junction in my process and I find it funny their page says their dedicated to getting their patients out of pain! If pain was my only problem I wouldn't complain and go else where but I'm dealing with a rare condition and I'm in the insurance with my specialist! If your looking for attentive staff that cares about what your saying when all your trying to do is advocate for yourself, this is not the place for you!|This office, staff and all physicians and associates are great. I just recommend asking for them to send the PA to the pharmacy and/or insurance during your appointment. But they treat you kindly and with empathy. They take time to listen to you and your concerns, and do not force procedure after procedure. They let the patients decide on what they are comfortable with doing.",2025-02-20|2025-01-17|2024-11-27|2024-06-28|2023-06-02|2024-08-19|2023-12-19|2023-05-10,1|1|4|1|4|5|1|4,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|11 a.m.",65.4|65.2|64.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do you provide home visits for physiotherapy?","We are currently not providing home visits for physical therapy.

I would highly recommend this particular office to anyone having difficulty with the spine. All of the procedures are done with care they explain exactly what's going on and they take them to consideration how you're feeling about everything. Overall an amazing experience.|Dr Doran and his staff are amazing!  On top of their normal procedure things, they are trying their best to get everything done by end of the year since they will no longer be in network for my insurance.  They truly care about their patients in multiple ways.  I wouldn't choose anyone else.|First, the office staff are friendly and efficient. They obviously care about each patient, individually.

Dr Doran was well prepared for me as a new patient. He had already reviewed Myspace xrays and my MRI results. He asked pointed questions to rule out other issues and offered thorough plans for my treatment. He answered all of my questions about my current neck problems and long term prognosis for my situation and my care.

Very well done.|Dr. Doran is fantastic. I have gotten several injections and always knew what was going on, as far as touches, numbing, placement and then medicine. I have never had to have sedation. He has a great rapport with the techs in the room. I would definitely recommend Dr Doran for pain management. His team and staff are all supportive and knowledgeable. My husband has seen Dr Doran, as well. He set him up with a nerve stimulator that has done away with the need for pain medication. He saves a lot of people from daily, disabling pain. 5 Stars for this practice.|Dr. Doran is always friendly and takes the time to go over everything with the patient.  I'm always anxious when I have procedures and he makes me feel comfortable.  His office staff is also friendly!|Dr Doran was great as always and staff did great too.  He lets you know everything happening first and makes sure all is good before he leaves.  His staff is always kind and helpful with all your needs.|Dr. Doran and his team, especially Jenny are so very kind, compassionate, and caring.  They put you at ease.  You leave knowing you'll get better or they'll find another route of care.  They always hit it first time with me.  I couldn't be happier, unless I never had pain.|Dr.Doran is wonderful.  I never feel a thing with back injections, painless. I never get sedated either when I get them.  He really is great. I highly recommend him.

We were finished and I didn't realize it. I like her entire staff. Very personable and friendly.  No pain from injection.|She is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. Takes time with her patients. I am dealing with a very unexpected and scary outcome of a surgery and she has instilled in me this is temporary and together we will "" fix"" my problem. Highly recommend Dr. Nath.|I have been coming to her since 2015.  She has always worked with me and I have had no issues.  She has always made conversation and made me feel welcome.  I know when I first came to her she had been late a couple of times but she made sure she corrected that.  I would not go anywhere else and she is a valued doctor to your team.|Wonderful very professional and passionate practitioner who does wonders in alleviating lower back pain.  In addition the staff at the surgical center are very friendly and considerate!|My experience with Dr. Nath was a very pleasant one.  I was nervous about the injection on the tailbone but she assured me I would be okay.  I didn't even feel it and was surprised it was over.  I was very comfortable with her style of working with her patients.|Dr. Nath is an amazing doctor and she knows what she is doing. You are in great hands as long as you don't long term care managed by medication. I had been a patient for 10+ years. I was moved to her N.P's since injections were no longer working and I was being treated by medication. I have been on the same medications for the last 10 years or so with the doses changing here and there. I always made it to my appts., usually early. Sometimes waiting hours to be seen. I never complained because I understood she was busy. I never asked for more medication or for my medication to be changed. After my last appt, I scheduled my next appt for 3 months out as normal. I thought I put the date in my phone wrong so I called the office. For over a month, I couldn't get anyone to answer or return my call about my next scheduled appt. After a month someone finally called me back and said that the N.P was leaving and they were not filling her position. I asked if I was able to schedule my next appt with Dr. Nath then. I was told no, that she was releasing me as a patient. I wasn't given a reason why at this point. Instead of being angry or panicked, at this point, and I'm sure it sounds silly, but I was hurt. Over 10 years and I felt like I was being abandoned. That same day I received a letter in the mail saying the same thing I was told on the phone, that I was being released. In the envelope was a list of other ""pain clinics"" in the area. I start calling the clinics to try and get an appt and get established. Due to the high doses of medication I was on, most refused to even schedule an appt with me. The others told me they could schedule an appt, but they wouldn't be able to give me the doses I have been taking for the last so many years. I felt pretty defeated by this point and I called Dr. Naths office back and explained the situation and asked if they have any recommendations or if there was anything I could do. I was told there was absolutely nothing that they could do and the list they sent weren't their recommendations, but just other pain specialists in the area. I asked if I could speak with Dr. Nath or her nurse or even just leave a message for them. I was told no. I called every pain specialist that I could find and I found only 2 willing to see me. The first appointment was in April. The doctor was incredibly nice and wanted to help me,.but because of the doses, he could only prescribe a little less than half of what I was taking. I tried. The pain in my leg became unbearable pretty quickly. He referred me to another specialist because by this point, I couldn't even drive myself the 3 minutes it took me to drive to his office. The new specialist is also amazing. They started me on a new medication that worked better than the high dose of pain meds I was on in the first place. Now of course my insurance no longer wants to cover that medication. So here I am 9 months later and I'm still fighting just for help because I would like to be able to at least function. So while I agree that Dr. Nath truly is an amazing doctor and knows what she's doing, I guess I now feel she picks and chooses which patients matter to her. Maybe because I'm no longer getting the costly injections, maybe because LBJI thought the time I took up was better used on a patient that they could charge more, that I no longer mattered. I'm not sure. What I am sure of is this...I'm still trying to get medication sorted out and I have no idea what to do because the spinal stimulator she put in isn't working properly and I don't know how to get help with it.|I have liked Dr Nath since I was introduced to her about 4 months ago. She is helping me with the pain and the crps that I have. I enjoy her and her nurse, Andrea. Very helpful and kind.|I absolutely LOVE Dr. Nath. She is kind, caring, compassionate and never makes me feel rushed. She always makes me feel important and like her only patient at that time.  Andrea is just as wonderful.

I understand that the medical staff has to be careful, but you can perform due diligence and still be cordial.|I have a rare chronic pain condition. After being treated at another office, I was told they couldn't help me anymore and I was referred to Dr. Michael Dorwart. My first visit was 7 years ago, he listened, asked questions, did his own research, and he came up with a way to treat me for a long time. There is no cure for my disease, no treatment, Dr. Dorwart gave me an option to have one medication instead of 5. My pain level is around a 3-5 most of the time. He made sure I understood he couldn't relieve my pain 100%, but he could get it low enough that I could function and I can. As this disease attacks my body Dr. Dorwart is always ready to listen and to provide options for me.

Don't take your loved ones here. They will not receive the care they need. When an elderly woman hobbles into the clinic for her appointment because she was referred there by her PCP to manage the pain she's experiencing after breaking her back whilst struggling with scoliosis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Parkinson's, the response CANNOT be to do absolutely nothing and tell her to come back in month to receive a treatment she's already tried that failed in the past. No part of me believes if Dr. Lee's mother came into the clinic with a spine so contorted she could barely eat or breathe because her ribs were pressing against her organs that he'd do nothing and tell her to keep suffering for another month. When I called back begging them to show a little compassion for the patient they just saw and do something to ease her discomfort until the upcoming appointment, their response was, ""Take her to the ER."" This is the kind of treatment you can expect if you take your loved ones here. The entire staff should be ashamed to call themselves healthcare providers.|Dr Shaffer left me unheard at my last visit. He i believe is one of those physicians that rides your insurance provider. He is sending me for more testi.f that is unnecessary and says there's nothing wrong in my mri when.it clearly shows bulged discs, herniated discs, straightening of the spine, a tumor in my neck and degenerative disc disease.|I liked Dr Lee and his nurse Rebecca, Rebecca gets many more stars than are listed here!! It was just a short first visit, but I'm hoping that he's a very kind and compassionate doctor.  Rebecca went above and beyond to make me feel better and she was very sweet and comforting. I'll add more when i spend more time with them. I'm hoping that he's going to be super kind and helpful. I've suffered for a very long time and need doctors that truly care. There just aren't very many doctors that actually care about their patients these days. It makes me very sad. Especially when someone needs real help. Compassion is key.
UPDATE!! Two days ago Dr Lee and his kind staff, Sherry and Jessica did Nerve Blockers on both of my knees. They were extremely kind and compassionate and Dr Lee was amazing at his work!! I had several needles inserted in each knee with minimal pain and I'm happy to say I'm already almost totally pain free. After years and years of suffering with knee pain and quarterly cortisone shots, I'm so happy to report that my knees feel better than they have since longer than i can remember!! Thank you Dr Lee and staff and thank you Rebecca! I can't forget to mention sweet Rebecca. A zillion stars!!!

UPDATE!! The nerve blocker procedure worked for about a week and a half. I called on Day 7, like they asked me to, to answer a series of questions about my pain before and after the procedure... I left a voicemail and someone did call me, but I had trouble disconnecting from my Bluetooth and told them to hang on. The call got disconnected.. I waited and waited and waited for them to call back, but they didn't. I called back and left a voicemail. No one called. Finally I left a message on my portal and was called early Monday morning but I was unable to answer because I was finishing packing my husband's bags for Simon Cancer Center, he was just getting ready to leave. I am upset that the procedure didn't work. I thought Dr Lee did a great job, but he isn't overly kind at all. I really wish he was more kind. His nurses are very sweet. Which I like very much. I don't know what the next steps will be, if any. At this point, I don't really care anymore. I'm used to being in pain.|I had an appointment there today. I showed up 15 minutes early to ensure time to do paperwork. I walked in the office and stood at the check in for about 5 minutes; the whole time while my knee hurt extremely bad and it felt like someone took a knife and ran it down my leg. Finally I had to sit down. I was the only patient in that clinic for 30 minutes. Finally after that time I left. As I was pulling out of the parking lot an employee there ran out to stop me. At that point I was so frustrated and had prior engagements I had to go. Perhaps if they were more concerned doing there work this would have not happened. They knew I was there I made contact with multiple employees.|Do not go see Dr. Lee . I tried to go to pain management after having two surgeons , one from IU as well as one from St Francis , both told me I needed a fusion surgery on my L5 . Dr Lee told me I did not need surgery I needed more injections , he wanted to give me one in each one of my lumber vertebrae's . Even after telling him I tried those already. He don't care , he just wants to make money putting injections that do nothing in his patients spine THAT'S IT . I think BOTH the surgeons I saw knew  what they was talking about . Dr Lee did not . Die don't have a good bedside manner either . Office staff that checks you in , they are unprofessional as well . Horrible experience .|I see Dr. Lee. When I started going they said they will take great care of me. I get flare ups and he does nothing to help. Currently having a flare up and he wanted me to make an appointment it's 6 WEEKS OUT! said to take OTC until then. Does he not think I've done that?! So I get to spend the weekend in pain with my family while he gets to go on vacation with his and have a great time. Doesn't seem like they take great care of their patients like I was told. I don't think he cares for his patients at all!!!! STAY AWAY FROM HIM IF YOU TRULY NEED HELP!!|My experience with this pain center, they have had some good caring doctor who are Willing to help folk just live without suffering & being in pain.. Dr Kumar was kind caring doctor & so was Dr. Martinez.
The staff at these offices has always been polite.
These New doctors Seem like they don't care if you are pain. One actually told me basically to get use to being in pain. That he has seen images of spine a 80-90 yr old who should be In pain but there not. That they just adjusted to being in pain. Got used to living in pain.
It's very obvious these young doctors have never been in pain a day of there life.
I pray God opens there eyes & there hearts.|I'm writing specifically about my experience with Dr Edgar Martinez who has given me back my life. Previously I was with Dr Earl Craig who ignored my concerns to such a degree that I was bedridden for almost 2 years.

When I heard that another Pain doctor was moving to Bloomington, I jumped on it and I was not disappointed. Dr Martinez is courteous, friendly, informative and most of all sympathetic. He never pushed a pain medication on me. He informed me of options for procedures, describing in detail and answering my questions on the way. When it became clear that my condition had progressed to a point in which a second opinion was needed, he was not afraid to ask. And I'm glad he did, because it turned out that I was actually slightly overdue for a back surgery. I can walk again. I can play with my children. I can sit in a chair. None of these things could have happened without his sharp eye and deep concern for my well being.",2024-12-20|2024-12-20|2024-02-13|2023-05-10|2022-07-05|2022-06-03|2021-11-06|2020-06-30,1|1|3|1|1|1|2|5,,,"2 p.m.|9 a.m.|10 a.m.",70.4|68.2|66.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJCdY0q6RlbIgR-1nPzpEY-0s,25

I will come back and update you after the procedure. The front desk secretary was rude and unfriendly. We called early in the morning on the day of our appointment. We received two texts with different times for our appointment.  I wanted to ensure I arrived on time, so I called to ask about the appointment time. I left a message at 8 a.m.; my appointment was at 2:15. I never received a callback. The desk clerk was very rude when I asked about it in the office.
We saw the Doctor, and he was very friendly and thorough. The procedure is set for the next week. We will update after the procedure is done.|Unbelievably RUDE front desk gal! Franiak is good as a doc, but the front office gal is rude and lazy! My husband has been trying to get a pre-authorization for a very important pain med & we were just told that she doesn't have time to do them. So, she goes through some fly-by-night specialty pharmacy that doesn't need pre-auths. And, it's no wonder they don't need pre-auths, they're a scam!!! Check out Sterling Pharmacy ... they take patient money & don't send the drug or send a fake drug!
I hope this gal NEVER has a loved one in pain & is forced to deal with someone like herself! She needs to work somewhere where she doesn't have to care about people!!
Doesn't matter anyway, Franiak's closing his private practice due to inept office staff!!|EXTREMELY disappointed with whomever is responsible for returning messages.  My mother had a procedure and had complications with the antibiotic but could not get through to the office at all during regular business hours.  Several messages were left throughout the day with concerns about her reaction and need for a different prescription called in before too much time got away since she was told it was very important to take.  Does anyone check the messages?|I haven't seen Dr Franika for the last 2 yrs, I just think the world of him and his wife Melissa. He's the most tender pain doc I've ever been to. I was having epidurals and other docs hurt me doing them. I did have the stimulator surgery and it helped b4 the surgery but not after it was implanted. They controll ur life always charging them, usually daily and it took about 2 hrs. Having MRIs was very scary they have to b fully charged, and it did heat up.
I had it removed I wanted it and the wires removed, That was the most painful surgery and I've had many surgeries I was IU in Carmel spine center, I hate that place, and Dr Smucker, that was 3 yrs ago and my right leg still doesn't have feeling, it's cold all the time, and now I have major neuropathy in both feet and legs. I fall, I broke 2 toes and never even felt pain. Every nite I bathe my right foot n ICY HOT because u have severe feet and leg cramps. I never know I have icy hot. on. I was told my feeling would come back In 6 months then 12 months then 18 months, I have to hold onto somewhere, driving is very hard because it's my right leg, I lost the job I loved. SO THINK VERY LING AND HARD B4 U GET A STIMULATOR...|Dr Franiak rushed into doing a pricey procedure to have an implant placed, where the equipment alone was 50k+, not including surgery and hospital fees. Very little alternative treatment was attempted or suggested. Now, 3 years later, I haven't had to use the implant in about 2 years, I've lost 100 pounds, my device has shifted and gets caught on things, and I've been having pain with the device. I've been trying to get in for 9+ months, but no one ever answers the phone or returns my calls, which I think is on purpose. Someone messed up one day and answered the phone and scheduled me over a month out. I show up to the appointment, which I drive an hour to get to, to be told that since they don't take either of my two insurances, that Dr. Franiak won't see me unless I pay an office fee out of pocket - They won't do a follow up visit on a patient they placed a medical device in years later because they can't keep profiting off me, Dr. Franiak pocketed the 100k+ from my procedure, but are worried about an office visit fee. Apparently I lucked out because I have a device that other surgeons *might* take out because of the equipment they chose. If they made a small change or went a different route, I would be SOL, which I might still be. Dr. Franiak does not care about his patients. I wish I never trusted him.|While the Dr's. Procedures mostly produce satisfactory results, the office personnel are very very slow if at all to respond for appointments.  I have left 2 messages in 1 1/2 weeks with no response whatsoever.|I was referred to Dr. Randall Franiak a few years ago to assist me with chronic back pain.  He helped me to maintain my activities with injections for several years.  As I aged the injections were not enough to treat my symptoms  Recently, he suggested an Medtronic Neuro Stimulator implant.  I was reluctant in the beginning.  I didn't want to give in to loosing any form of control or independence.   Dr. Franiak and I discussed my options.  An appointment was scheduled to meet with someone from Medtronic.  I even called Dr. Jill Donaldson  for her thoughts since she performed spinal surgery in the past.  I opted to do the surgery for the implant.  Well,  I'm 4 weeks post surgery and I'm doing well.  I'm looking forward  to a summer that is limitless for my outside activities/hobbies.  Thank you Dr. Franiak.|I have had lower back pain for many years.

I've always been treated respectfully and with compassion and professionalism. The staff are friendly. Dr Feng listens to everything I saw. Even if I sit there and cry. I would go no where else.|I decided to quit going to this pain management clinic today. They gave me a letter during my last visit, saying I had rescheduled 4 appointments and 1 more, would result in me not being able to been seen again. I had 2 appointments rescheduled because of emergency eye surgery I had for a detached retina. 1 other missed because we accidentally forgot my pain meds for them to count. They said I did a no show, even though me and my wife tried to call for a straight hour and they weren't answering their phones. They made me go several days without meds as a punishment for rescheduling. The letter from them was very threatening. The yell at you for breaking certain rules, but they never tell you the rules before hand. They count your pills and treat you like a criminal even if you are just a pill off. They have you do a drug screen at every appointment and it is a very basic one that can give false positives or false  positives. I have gastroparesis and have issues absorbing meds. Entire pills pass through me sometimes. I would take my pain meds and they would not show up in a test because of it. They think they are God's gift to medicine and that you cannot know anything about your conditions. The actual doctor is a nice guy and is very professional. The nurse practitioners are extremely rude, talk down to you and they act like jerks. They all have God complexes and talk down to you. They don't respect the fact that they wouldn't get paid if you didn't come to your appointments. The nurse practitioners act like they are above you and have no qualms about doing it. This clinic is not about helping patients, they are just in it for the money. In the months I went, my meds were changed only once. They would ask what my pain levels were, I'd say 9/10, and they'd do nothing to address it. Nothing to help lower the pain or any real med changes. They are just glorified pill pushers. I call them legal drug dealers. I'm pretty sure they get some kind of incentive to prescribe certain pain meds. Avoid this clinic like the plaque as you will end up getting treated bad like I did. They have no respect for their clients and the bad treatment they give you makes any anxiety you may have worse. Do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else.|I actually give this place no stars. They dr and staff are very rude. They belittle you and act like you are someone bad. Do not send your love one here.|If I could give no stars, I would.

My husband referred to this place over a month ago because his insurance takes it, and he needs better control of his pain issues which are caused by a rare disease.

First, it was ""the doctor didn't send enough records."" Then it turned into ""the office manager needs to review them."" Waited over a month with no callbacks only to call today and speak with a snotty receptionist (believe everyone who says the staff is rude!) who said that they couldn't speak with me, his wife, despite other staff having talked with me in the past, and then we get told that the office isn't accepting new patients. They could've said THAT over a month ago so he and his PCP weren't waiting! Ridiculous!|This is absolutely the WORST office to be a patient at. The Nurse Practitioner is extremely rude. The Doctor DOESN'T listen and he will prescribe medication that people are allergic to. They treat people like addicts. The only thing they do is count pills, and send refills. They don't treat any conditions and have no clue into people with Chronic Pain Conditions & Diseases. Their attitude (including their staff) is so horrible, it instantly makes a person's anxiety go through the roof, which in turn raises their pain level. This place needs to be shut down!!! Horrible. Just Horrible!|Always professional and kind. Recommend Dr Feng highly. Has been my dr for several years after my cancer center sent me there.|The staff is great !

And I actually wished I would have listened to my friend who left this clinic and went somewhere else. We had discussed a care plan that the N.P. didn't follow herself. She said she wanted to see if the injections worked and decreased my meds. Well, first, she decreased my meds, which left me in tremendous pain. I asked for her to give me back my gabapentin and muscle relaxers, she refused. Not even being  fully aware of my multiple conditions. I was scheduled for a procedure early morning. I woke up to a flat, I couldn't change the tire because I was already in pain, and it was freezing out. Even if I could I didn't have a spare or anyone to fix it because I'm not working. So, I rescheduled my appointment until my daughter could get it fixed for me. I messaged for a refill and got a generic response saying I had to wait for my appointment with my provider. I have no appointments with witch is what I messaged. I get a response full of crap talking about how I broke our treatment plan because I missed my appointment. I call b.s. our treatment plan was broken when she said it. I've been going through this mess since both my ""DR.s"" left. I don't want to see anyone who will cold heartedly leave their patients in tremendous pain. How do I leave a zero for care and concern.|The staff at the LaPorte location have no compassion and it shows that most of them are just there for a paycheck. Most of the doctors have a terrible attitude towards the patients and only care about the billing concerns. The doctor I seen was rude and not at all concerned about how I felt as a patient. Honestly I would not let them treat my pets. I am seeking  treatment else were, unless I can get into see NP Chelsea Dalton, she is a real doctor and cares for her patients.

Doctor really easy to talk too and he listens to you about your pain! I really suggest if you need a pain management he's the one for you!|Worst clinic ever!  I have never been treated like this on the phone.  I will not defend myself for needing pain medication for a physical impairment, nor should I have to.  Everyone who is on pain medication is not seeking drugs to get high!  These people, and that includes the manager are toxic and assuming instead of compassionate and professional.  They are exactly the type of people who Should Not be in the medical business.  Which is completely how they approach patients. All business!  Instead of trying to help, they reveled in telling me what I was thinking, and why at every turn they could not assist me. From the wrong kind of  insurance to the wrong  kind of pain to actually cutting me off and accusing me of lying, they could not get me off the phone fast enough.  They finally refused to qualify me even if all the stars in the universe lined up and hung up in my face!  I feel sorry for anyone who goes to them. They most certainly will show you the door if you expect them to act professionally.|Excellent service and helped me on the first visit with relief from the pain I was in. Highly recommend this staff. A+
Edit - After going on the referral of the Dr I finally was able to get an MRI done and needed surgery. Now that I had my surgery I still am in pain and have been trying to get back in to see them and have g been able to even get an appointment scheduled for over a month. Stay away from them!|THIS ENTIRE PRACTICE IS A JOKE AND DR. DUNHAM IS AN UNSTABLE INDIVIDUAL! DO NOT TAKE YOUR LOVED ONES HERE! My father is a patient here and after a recent fall and other issues I've taken over managing things for him so I took him to his last appointment. He has been on 3 pills a day although they bumped down the dosage a while back. At this last appointment his dose was changed to 2 pills a day but the doctor did NOT inform me he made that change. So I continued giving my dad his medicine as usual. Then I noticed there were not enough pills and that's when I discovered it was changed to 2 pills. So I called the office to see why it changed and if they could give him something to get by until his next refill because he did not have enough. The woman in the office was VERY rude the entire time while insisting the doctor told us and that it's my fault for not reading the label. Which I admit I should have looked but to be honest I had no reason to look since I wasn't informed it would be changing but lesson learned. Anyways they wouldn't give him anything to get him by until his refill so his home health nurse (who is extremely sweet) called to try to get him something and she said the office lady was extremely rude to her as well. Also just to add they are knocking down his dose due to him being on oxygen but i spoke with his pulmonary doctor and he said there is no need to knock it. So today this same office lady called me to reschedule his appointment for next week from Monday to Wednesday. Well Wednesday didn't work well so she said it would then be NEXT Wednesday. I said he shouldn't have to go another week without his medicine and she again in a nasty and aggressive way asserted it was my fault he is out and if Wednesday didn't work then she could take him off the schedule  PERMANENTLY. I told her she had a bad attitude and she says ""Why because you didn't read the bottle?"" No because she is a disgusting person and is threatening to take an innocent person off the schedule permanently. So I called back later and another lady answered. I told her I wanted to make a complaint on the other lady AND SHE TRANSFERRED ME TO THE LADY I WAS MAKING A COMPLAINT ABOUT. So nasty lady picks up the phone and I realized it was her and said I didn't want to talk to her. She then said ""Then don't call back"" and hung up on me. I don't think you can get more unprofessional than this woman. Then I called the Anderson office and I spoke to the clinical director about thr situation and she said we could have the pulmonary doctor send a form explaining that his dosage is not an issue for his condition, which he did. My mother ended up having to take my dad to the appointment (they are divorced but friendly) and Dr. Dunham was looking for a fight the moment they walked in. Granted I was not there for this interaction but both of my parents have the same account of what happened and have no reason to lie. Dunham was immediately rude and condescending about the entire situation and began SCREAMING at my parents and accused them of cussing at him (which I would be absolutely shocked to see either of my parents cuss at someone, they are not that kind of people). At one point while yelling Dunham stood up and my mother was afraid he was going to physically hit her. He then kicked them out of his office and my father still is without his pain medication. After speaking with the clinical director again I discovered Dunham FALSIFIED my father's records and stated that my parents were the ones that were extremely rude and cussing at him. THIS MAN IS UNSTABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE IN HEALTHCARE! None of us have ever had any issues with a healthcare provider but after reading other reviews about this ""doctor"" it is no surprise we had issues with him. We will definitely be reporting him to the insurance and the board of health.|The lady's at front desk are always so cheerful & friendly. Dr. Dunham has been a blessing to me. I have arthritis in my neck & lower back, ever since I've been going there I actually have relief from pain. He listens to me & genuinely wants to see you pain free. Definitely recommend going here if you're in pain. I also love how they play KLove in the office.|They are  heaven sent for me I have had problems finding a pain management doctor willing to take my pains on.

Nobody wants to have to go to pain management, but they do the best around. Of course, there are rules that must be followed. But, and it's a big one, it's because there are a lot of laws they have to follow or they could lose their career and education. Plus youre actions could cause them problems as well if you arent acting right. If you're unhappy with the rules, call the FDA, they set limits and limited medications and cut production of meds if there is a shortage of meds. The providers here are some of the most professional if not the best practicing. Its a hard job dealing with people inpain (hard to be in pain too) and they are understanding about it.

The office is clean and the wait time is short.  There is a bathroom located within the waiting area.  The staff is kind and courteous.  MyChart makes it easy to communicate with providers by skipping phone calls.  I feel like the staff really listens and responds to needs as they come along.  I would recommend this office for all your pain management needs.  I have used them several times whether for COMP or for personal chronic pain needs.  I have been treated with absolute respect and not made to feel beneath me for getting assistance with easing my pain.  The lobby is usually empty when I attend and telehealth appts are sometimes available skipping the wait.|Dr Roberts and his staff are the best, one of the very few doctors I've ever met with that actually sat with me and truly listened to what I had to say.  He changed my life by getting me to the right people to figure out what my injury actually is.  I'm very thankful for the help he has given me.

He is beyond caring and extremely interested in each individual patient.  His clinical staff is also very professional and caring.
What I have been unhappy with is the difficulty in communication with the office.  It just been almost impossible to reach a live person when it is  necessary.  It is a totally automated system, and when given the option to speak with someone in the Carmel office, you are again left to leave a message.  Often it takes days for the message to be returned.  I firmly believe that these messages are not being transferred to the doctor.  They are very much in need of a designated person to answer, triaged are being called back in a timely manner.  Once that situation is corrected, I would not hesitate for a second to recommend Dr Wellington.|Dr. Wellington is a amazing blessing to me and my family. I am so grateful that we found his care for my chronic pain. The nurses I typically see Sherry and Cindy are amazing!|I would post a 0 if i could. The patient service is terrible.

I cannot get the test that my neurosurgeon has requested, Until someone calls me back.

Love Dr Wellington, love his support staff. But would not recommend anyone seeing him because of lack of support for the patient's  from the office.|Dr. Wellington is the best Dr. Whose ever taken care of me.

He really seems to care about resolving some of these pain issues I have had for a long time.  He is very personable and speaks in terms that I can understand.  He doesn't seem to mind being asked a lot of questions about the procedures I need to undergo.  He even suggested another place to take my MRI since SIRA was going to take a month to get me an appointment.  I was able to get my MRI in just a few days instead.  He seems to have a plan and not just throwing things at the wall to see if they stick.  I am very grateful I found him!|Dr. Adams is a great doctor he's trying his best to get me together with all this pain I have going on with my back.

I called back to ask about a prescription, and he personally called me back to discuss it with me. Before I was called back to the examination room, I had the opportunity to watch Dr. Adams interact with front desk questions. He was also kind and patient with the support staff's questions.  Watching him interact with them and also two sales reps who interrupted his day gave me yet another positive impression.

He is one of the most compassionate Dr's I've ever had. He takes his time with you and listens closely to your individual medical needs and will try different options that may help you. He's not an assembly line Dr. that treats all patients the same. You are truely an individual with Dr. Murphy. He has helped me get my quality of life back and for that I am very thankful!|Dr. Murphy is wonderful, caring, and knowledgeable. His staff is another matter. They won't return phone calls, they won't send your pharmacy prescription refills, and they don't do reminder calls because they ""have too many patients"". However, their paperwork that patients are required to fill out states that they do provide reminder calls as a courtesy.  I've never been to any medical provider that didn't do appointment reminder calls. And the receptionist could have easily made twenty reminder calls instead of running her mouth in the two hours past my appointment time that I waited to see Dr. Murphy. I gave up after two hours and left and will never return, nor because of him but his staff.|I have been a patient of Dr. Murphy since 2001.  He has truly helped me with my chronic pain (back issues and neuropathy).  I like him so much because he is open to natural ways of healing.  He treats you like family and truly cares!  He is a brilliant doctor and I am so glad my neurologist referred me to him so many years ago.|Dr. Murphy Is a the best at his job and keeps me pain free with No drugs. I have been going to him for more then ten years. Thank you for being the best at your job.|Murphy Pain Center is slowly killing my wife. They keep pumping Fentanyl and others that I do not know about in her.Why have they not noticed that she only weighs 89 pounds.She should weigh 110-115 pounds I have to force her to eat. She is constantly in LA LA Land and is a danger to herself and others. She has been involved in several car accidents, fortunately none were serious. If she dies, I will hold Murphy completely responsible. This has gone on for years. I was always curious why they closed their practices in Louisville, Ky and moved everything to Indiana. Now I know. They could not keep giving all these drugs in Kentucky because of laws regulating these substances. If you are a Junkie, then Murphy Pain Center is the place for you.|Worst most unethical doctor around in southern Indiana. He makes you sign a contract that says you will notify him of other doctors that may prescribe narcotics to you and when you do tell him he still will say you voided his contract and tell every other doctor you try to go to the same when you told him the truth and even had a prescription. He is a heartless pig that cares about nothing. The Nurse practitioner Karen however is the best and should go out on her own.|Dr Murphy & staff has always been there for me. Took care of me when dealing with cancer 2 yrs ago. Went above & beyond. Staff called me to check on me several times. When I see him he takes his time & listens. I like him.|I first started seeing dr murphy over 20 years ago. Never failed a random drug test or pill count. Dr Murphy used to fight for humans to have the right to live pain free. Wow has that ever changed slowly over the years. Cut off of 1 of my medications in the middle of going thru stage 4 bladder cancer. I went thru having my bladder removed and came home with nothing for that pain because other drs won't write scripts when you have 1 doing it. But he refused. Then I was told I could no longer be a patient because they moved to Indiana and I lived in Ky. Went thru getting records transferred but asked for 1 more apt to last till my new apt. But told by Karen that I could stay. So I stayed with what i knew. Went a month later,  Where I was told self pay only. No longer would he file insurance. Which also means you pay full price for meds and drug tests. New year and new surprises. I go in and told they want to do a mouth swab, ok fine. The girl kept redoing it over & over. Said it wasn't working. Finally after leaving most of the swab broke up in my mouth she said ok. A week later I get called saying I failed & need to drive another hour away, couldn't do it near my home, to Bradstown for a 2nd test. I can't afford to pay out anymore. Explained that I am stretched with no pay this month due to disability and can show that. As well as my mother in stage 4 kidney failure at this time and I'm just not paying anymore. After 20 years of not even a shadow on my record this is how you do a patient. Dropped. Nothing but another bill for the past month that I was never seen. I can't even begin to describe how pissed off, let down and hurt that I am. And you wonder why people are doing the things their doing. It's in desperation of a dr playing god. Who knows me better than this. I'm made to feel like a criminal over a medication I never asked for or wanted but was talked into 24 years ago. Karen is wonderful, can't say enough good things bout her. Do like Michael and get out. Now I'm unable to get an appointment with any pain Mgt dr.  To live without pain is a basic human right.

Boody (amazing surgeon). Dr. Funk is very knowledgeable and talked me through the injections. Unfortunately they did no good for me and I had to have a spinal fusion. This was by no means his fault.

He really loved going to Dr Biglar until a new employee came on board. I was standing beside him when someone called saying he was being dismissed. A 75 yr old man cold turkey. Thank you. Also they asked about upcoming injections and my husband said ""will they cancel those too?"" And the person hung up on him. What? A letter said he was ""very angry"" on the phone. He wasn't angry, he was in shock. Anyone that knows my husband knows he's very laid back and being married over 25 years I'm a pretty good judge of his character. I understand you doing what you need to do but please don't lie and hang up on people when you just ripped their quality of life away.|I was just fired from Dr. Bigler's office saying that I have been taking my pain meds too much. I have been on pain meds for over 13 years due to a broken back. His Nurse Harmony Stein is not a nice person. All she wants to do is get people off of pain meds. She shut me down with no refills. She is on the wrong profession.|Only giving 1 star so I can write review,  all this place does is push opiodes,  I did everything they asked so I could get off meds and get pain pump or TENS unit,  but Dr. Bigler said "" I just don't feel you are ready"". That was after the fact I had to drive 2 hours to psychologist (which by the way insurance didn't cover so I'm stuck paying $300-$400 out of pocket for), Dr. Bigler stated "" let's do injections, the surgical center will waive cost of sedation"", this is the 6th time he has canceled injection ( have proof of all canceled injections) with little to no notice. Try to bring up thoughts and concerns about costs of meds,  about meds not working and get dismissed.  Never feel wanted,  heard of validated. I came to them from previous IU pain management( Dr. Llyod office the best, only left for better pain control without opiodes) bc I didn't want to take opiodes,  but did it here to move forward,  but got me no where then they want to drug test ($90 after insurance),$35 co-pay, then only pharmacy in area that will fill them chargers arm & leg bc they from upon so many opiodes for long term.  I am no longer returning so of course they cancel all meds,  BUT they shouldn't have canceled the 2 meds that I was on before I came to Bigler's office.  So cold turkey should be a great way to end the worst experience, in the worst pain management ever!!!!!
UPDATE: Called number below to discuss issues and get no answer typical blah blah blah recording leave name, number, issue your calling about and we will get back with you!! What a joke!!|Dr. Bigler was a physician for my father Steven Burchfield. My father had absolutely nothing but wonderful things to say about Dr. Bigler and if you knew my daddy and all the pain he was in physically due to so many injuries, Parkinsons also dealing with Cancer to find a Dr. That he can crack jokes with and talk to comfortably; that's saying something! My daddy has passed six years ago now and told me then if there were ever a time I needed to see a pain management physician that I should definitely seek out Dr. Bigler. I have tried but to no avail only get an answering service and no returned calls. Regardless,  I am thankful my daddy found a physician he truly liked, that could help him in the final months before he passed away. Thank you Dr. Bigler and God Bless you.

Before we went back into surgery, he explained in detail what our two choices of approach were and decided which would be most beneficial. Because I was awake, he also warned me when something might hurt. When I had a complication of blood pressure dropping during procedure, whole team was quick to respond and attentive with care back in the exam room. I would go to him again if I needed more pain-relief injections. My main concern was that I had no information before going to the procedure, about what was involved: that it was more than a ""shot"",  that I'd get an I.V., that you might want full sedation, that you might want to bring someone with you. It seems people are usually sent this information, but I did not. Those would have been factors in whether I'd get something done, especially if you can't be sure it will work.|I have been seeing Dr Shukla for several years.  I have low back pain L4 & L5  causing sciatica.

When I described my pain & symptoms, he wanted to do an MRI right away and was able to quickly get it scheduled. I was thankful a Dr. was finally taking me seriously. He was patient with me and listened to all of my concerns. We went over my MRI together and he showed it to me on the computer. My disc herniation was massive. He encouraged me, but never pushed me, to schedule an ESI. Honestly, I should've listened to him and gotten the ESI scheduled sooner. I waited a week and was in a lot of pain. He was very professional and kind while he administered the ESI and made me feel comfortable and safe. Sadly, the ESI only helped me for a few days, but he was able to quickly refer me to a surgeon that was able to meet with me fairly quickly and complete surgery. I'm feeling MUCH better now thanks to ISG!|I have seen Dr. Gentile numerous times. What a great doctor! He is genuinely committed to helping his patience and improving their condition. He is also easy to talk to and explains everything very clearly. A good, kind, and caring man. I highly recommend him and Dr. Riley.|Very professional group.

All previous injections were done with conscious sedation. If I have to ever have another injection, I don't know if I need to ask for sedation.|Dr. Gentile spent quality time prior to the injection, explaining all the details of what the injection experience would be like.  I was especially interested in the anatomy and physiology of the procedure, and Dr. Gentile was thorough and patient as he explained the details.  I also greatly appreciated Gentile's running narrative as the procedure itself progressed.  Understanding what sensations I would be experiencing, as well as the pain levels to be expected during the procedure was very, very helpful to me.  Thank you to both Dr. Gentile and his assistant.  Their ""bed-side"" demeanor was excellent and Gentile's level of professional expertise was exceptional.  Kudos!|Outstanding results from procedure. Dr Gentile is very informative prior, during and after the procedure. Immediate pain relief. Knowing this is only short-term relief, Dr Gentile went the extra step to provide a referral for the next step, when the time comes. Excellent patient care.

I first saw the Nurse, then PA and finished with the doctor.  All were very informative and discussed options for a variety of different ways to get me back to walking with less/no pain.  I have opted to go with the MILD procedure which my hubby had about 6 weeks ago and has seen improvement.  Entire staff was pleasant to work with.  I was treated like part of the family.|The doctor seemed a little indecisive and had to base all of his decisions on what the insurance company wanted. Seemed like he was more worried about the insurance company than me. I'm unsure if I will continue treatment at this doctor. Unfortunately most doctors seem so willing to give up and bow down to the insurance companies.|When I first visited this office in December, I was told that they did not issue pain meds to new patients until a urinalysis was returned.  I had been on both morphine, and methadone from my pain management physician in Florida, but my relocation to Indiana in late November eliminated that treatment regimen. I had experienced 5 back surgeries and experienced a significant continuation of pain. My followup appointment was scheduled for mid-January, but a stretch of bad weather changed that appointment to a telehealth appointment. The appointment was with one of the doctor's physician assistants. Before hanging up, I asked about pain meds. At my first appointment, a new MRI was ordered, which took place about a week prior to the telehealth appointment. The answer to my question concerning pain medication was ""we want to wait until we receive an evaluation from a neurosurgeon."" They gave me the name of a neurosurgeon, but not his address or phone number. At my next PCP appointment, I expressed my displeasure with the ""pain"" clinic to my PCP. He told me that if I was dissatisfied with APAC, they would refer me to a different pain management physician. An appointment was made for me, not at a different pain clinic as I expected, but with a different neurosurgeon in Crown Point. I went to the appointment with the neurosurgeon in Crown Point, and took along a copy of the MRI written report, as well as the DVD that I was given by the imaging center. The remarks by the surgeon drew me aback: he showed me on the DVD the area at L2/3. The nerve root at this level was so compressed that it didn't even show up on the MRI. (His remark.) He recommended immediate surgery, which would add another fusion, my third, this time at L2/3. I left that appointment with a sense of shock.
At my next PCP appointment, I told of the appointment with the neurosurgeon. My PCP recommended that I have the surgery ASAP, as it was quite possible that the condition could result in my waking up one day completely paralyzed. It has been my intention to return to Florida once finances permit it. My PCP told me NOT to even try to ride that far without having the surgery FIRST. By this time, it was mid April. I decided to give ACAP one more chance. Heck, with the PROOF of the MRI, and the report from the neurosurgeon of my choice, how could they possibly refuse to get me the pain meds that I OBVIOUSLY need? The appointment was scheduled for May 3. I called the neurosurgeon's office, asking them to send a copy of the doctor's report to the APAC office in Dyer, Indiana. I was promised that the report would be faxed immediately.
The May 3 appointment arrived. I was confident that I would leave that appointment with the scripts for the pain medication(s) that I obviously needed. I was once again paired with a physician's assistant, although the doctor was in the office that day. After the initial pleasantries, I told the PA why I had not returned sooner. It was because I felt that I had been LIED to over the timing of pain medication being prescribed. Not much was said about this ""lie"". I then asked about their opinion of the report by my neurosurgeon. THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. An attempt to reach that doctor's office was supposedly made, but by this time, it was after 4pm on a Friday, and it was said that they could not reach them because the office was closed. I asked if their office had received a copy of the MRI films and report. I was told ""YES"". I replied, "" then you KNOW, based upon the MRI, that it's OBVIOUS that I'm in pain!"" I once again asked about prescribing pain meds for me. The reply to me was such that I thought it to be TOTALLY INCREDULOUS. The response was ""we don't want to mask your symptoms"". WHAT IN THE HELL ARE PAIN MEDS INTENDED TO BE FOR????
I stomped the best I could, since I use a stand-up 4 wheeled walker, out of their office, stating ""YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN!!""
This narrative spells out my experience with the APAC Centers for Pain Control office in Dyer, Indiana.|I have been a patient at APAC since 2009 and have always had a positive experience. The staff is efficient and friendly. There have been several changes in staff, including the physicians, and I have been impressed with the way changes were handled. Every effort was always taken to make sure my issues were addressed. When a schedule change was necessary I was able to make the change with very little wait time.|The best decision I made was to see Dr. Patel...after testing and evaluations, I was given a new lease on life via a nerve stimulator.  I should have gone years ago!   If you are in unbearable pain, I recommend him and his office!!|I've been going to see Dr. Patel for a long time, he has taken care of me . He is always so nice and explains everything that he's going to do to me. He very gentle and makes sure I'm comfortable when he has to give me an injection in my back, neck or any other part of my body. I would recommend him to everyone I know he's a Great doctor...

She comes into the room like a breath of fresh air - always bubbly and happy. Amazing bedside manner, relatable and friendly. She takes her time, you never feel like you're being rushed -- which is rare nowadays in healthcare.
Her staff members are always patient, friendly and helpful.
Without going into detail, I'll just say Dr. Ferrell changed my life. I have a quality of life I haven't had in many years, thanks to her knowledge and skill.
I HIGHLY recommend her.|Always pleasant environment at every visit. Dr Ferrell shows she is really concerned about my health and treatment for pain relief.|I've been seeing Dr. Ferrell for many years. She literally saved me from a shaddy doctor. The doctor she filled in for required that you get injections if you wanted pain meds. Didn't matter if they helped you or not. He wouldn't listen when I told him the injections cause more pain because I have fibro. He had long waits & a rude staff. I sat in his office one time for 6 hours because I upset his staff when I asked how much longer the wait would be. After 2 years, Dr. Ferrell covered his patients one day & that was the day she saw me. She was my blessing. She reviewed my chart & told me injections don't help when you have fibro. I told her I've been saying that & they ignore me. I became a patient of Ferrell's that day. Later, that other doctor was arrested & lost his license for using pain pills to get things he wanted from patients. Dr. Ferrell has helped me so much over the years & I'm truly grateful. Her nurse assistant is amazing too. She works just as hard to help people as Ferrell does. The office staff is so polite and professional every single time I interact with them.|I love her! She listens and explains things in a way that is easy to understand. She works with me to get more mobility and ease my pain.|She's a great Pain Mgmt Specialist! I have been going to her around 10yrs. She's caring, kind and very concerned about my needs for my for my pain which is high! Her entire staff are kind, thoughtful, caring, and understand what I'm going through! I would never change to another pain management specialist!|Dr. Ferrell is a godsend! She is smart and listens, she has a great personality. Cynthia and staff are great too! I thank God for Dr. Ferrell and u will too! I truly would not be here if it wasn't for her!|I was referred to Dr. Ferrell by my primary care doctor to get a 2nd opinion after a different spine doctor tried 2 failed nerve root injections and said there was nothing more they could do for me. Dr. Ferrell took a look at my MRI results and said she felt I would benefit from an epidural injection, which is exactly what I suggested to the previous doctor I had seen and was told it wouldn't help. Turns out she was right, and the epidural has been the only thing that has truly given me some relief from my constant nerve pain. I'm beyond thankful for Dr. Ferrell and her team!|The best of the best.  Truly cares about her clients.  Honest and Truthful, she goes beyond the call of duty to make sure you feel good about where you are with your health.  Gives you a plan and makes sure you follow it, and all the rules.

The second time was awesome. Got in and he looked a my M.R.I. Let me know what I needed for care. It was 2 to 3 days later I was walking again. And only had to go about every 9 months for a shot if needed. I still will not go to anyone else. I have seen other docters because I had moved. What a joke that was.

Also NP Zachary may have been a good NP if I had had seen him originally.  I found it odd I had to go over my intire situation when at my last visit. Because I travel aways for these appointments and would be nicer if I had the same NP familiar with my case..... just saying.|On my first visit it was NP Edward's and he was wonderful. The second visit I seen I don't know some Zachary person. Everything that was discussed with Mr Edward's the Zachary person basically called me a liar. Third visit the Zachary person basically said I was off on 1 or 2 of my meds he basically made me feel like a drug addict. Told me they couldn't help me any longer and cut me loose. I am a 60 year old grandma. Not some 20 year old seaker. I have psoriatic arthritis and have had for years. I would not recommend this place because the Zachary guy will make you feel like crap.|I had my first appointment with this facility and it was wonderful. I could not have asked for a better experience. The staff was great and everyone listened to what I had to say.|I would highly suggest that patients keep an eye their blood work.
I question the nurse practitioner why they did not advise me that my creatine levels were dangerously low Which indicated I was in early signs of kidney failure They were negligent in not Telling me or notifying my primary care doctor So by questioning there negligence they dismiss me as a patient. But little did they know my primary spoke with me the week before stating that they did not want me to be seen at summit pain management any further and I had already seeked out another office.  They also break the new state rules on opiate prescribing. Only one Medical physician is to Prescribe a Patient opiate pain medicine. And I have had 3 or 4 people from summit pain management which  is against the rules. That Right there my pharmacy brought to my attention.
Always be your own advocate and don't be afraid to question them. I'm sure they'll be under investigation.|They listen, they are kind, and they care. They have helped me more than any other doctor and helped solve some medical issues that were being ignored by other doctors. I can't thank them enough.|They act kind, caring, and understanding. They say they will work with you to provide the best care possible. But then you express having problems with the micro dose of meds not being enough, and you just get treated like an addict. This place was my last hope. I know now that doctors don't care about chronic pain patients at all. Their idea of working with you is to dictate to you everything and then expect you to meekly go along. They say to call if you are in unbearable pain, but then you do and they just tell you they will talk about it at the next appointment. I really thought I had found a place willing to work with me enough to get me back to work. Sadly, I was wrong and I feel beyond discouraged.|I finally was scheduled to see Dr. Roth after going to Summit pain management in Marion for about 10 months. During this time, I saw a different nurse practitioner every appointment, many times causing me to have to start at the beginning to explain what was going on with me. When I finally got to see the doctor, I was very impressed with him, but communication with the office is a nightmare. He wanted to see me again in 4 weeks, but the office made the appointment in 5, and then called after 2 weeks to cancel THAT one and put it off another month after that, even though I tried to explain this was the doctor's recommendation. (After 10 months of waiting to see him in the first place). During these first months, I found they do not return calls, and they ""dropped the ball"" several times with my treatment, causing 3-4 week delays with tests and treatment that my insurance required. Twice they blamed the insurance for dropped communication that was obviously their fault. This doesn't sound like a big deal, unless you consider this is "" pain management"". I was in chronic pain, which was severe at times, so an extra 3-4 weeks waiting with each unnecessary delay caused me needless suffering. After seeing how inefficient they are, I chose not to let them prescribe narcotics for me. This was a wise choice, because after all these months, I would surely be dependent on them by now, one more problem to add to my list. I was told by one nurse practitioner that I did not need to go to a specialist because I ""didn't need surgery"". I could not stand the pain any more, so I made an appointment through my GP and went ANYWAY. I was told by the specialist, after all these months, that surgery was the ONLY thing that would help me.  In addition, it was bad enough NO insurance would have made me ""jump through the hoops"" that pain management told me that I needed to do.  If you need pain management, there has got to be a better choice than Summit!|DR. Roth comes across as a very understanding and caring person. You see him the first time and then you are only seen by one of his assistants.  He has 3 ""phone nurse's. 2 out of 3 are caring. However- 1 bad apple can spoil an entire practice.  You voice your concerns about how rude and unprofessional is and you will receive a letter on plain white paper, no business letter head , stating they will ""no longer be a provider "" for you ,due to ""a breakdown in communication"".  It does not say who drafted the letter. It also states you ""can not be on any company property. Tried to express concerns to office mgt. And, was angrily defensive about the complaint I made about 1 of the phone nurse's.
Dr. Roth promised to take over my pain control after a surgery I had. Instead- he left me to handle it through my surgeon, after the 2 of them discussed follow up care after surgery. My surgeon could not get him to contact him back. I was left to taper off the Fentanyl patch on my own. I was on 75 mg, then this problem happened. I was told all my future appointments were canceled and there would be 1 prescription for 50mg to taper off with.  But yet had no problem writing prescriptions for 2 other powerful pain pills.  Which went to waste because of the side effects I had from trying to take them.  I dont think he has any clue as to what is going on in his office.  Try calling his office and see the difficulty there is to even get through to talk to someone!   So, if you want someone to bail out on you at the last minute it, he's the guy to go to.  However, there are avenues. I am going to bring this kind of information to light.",2025-01-21|2024-10-11|2024-10-17|2024-01-06|2024-10-18|2022-04-12|2021-02-25|2020-12-09,3|1|5|1|5|1|1|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|2 p.m.",82.8|80.2|77.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Is there a pain management doctor",Yes,pain_management_services|medication_management|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|extended_hours|wheelchair_accessible_facility|free_parking|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|comfortable_waiting_area|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|efficient_service|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJr_qsv4NVFIgReUqHTLYd9es,19

I've been here for exactly 1hr 20 minutes! I'm just here for a simple follow up. The reason I didn't give 1 star is because I like Dr. Mcdonnell and some of the staff. There are a lot of staff who are very unprofessional. I wonder how some of these people were able to get a job in the medical field. They have no respect for a persons time. In typically in and out with my appointments. I requested my normal amount of time off for these simple follow ups today, and this is absurd. If this decline in service continues, I will find a new doctor's office to go to. I may have to update this review once I get out of here with the final amount of time spent here for this appt. I'm generally in and out of here in 15 minutes. I hear the staff through the doors just laughing and joking with eachother, having a good time. They seem to lack knowledge, professionalism, and care for a persons time. *UPDATE* 1hr and 41 minutes for a discussion with the doctor that lasted 3 to 4 minutes.|Dr. McDonnell is amazing.  He preformed a Spinal Cord Implantation in October of 24. I have completely healed, and have never been happier with the results. It's been life changing. I spent years in severe pain, and unable to stand up straight. I could not stand for more than a few minutes without pain. I was unable to leave my house except for appointments. I can now live a normal life. I highly recommend Dr. McDonnell.|Very unprofessional.I had no problem with this clinic before my doctor retired. I was giving a new doctor I've yet to see him or her I have no idea who it is. I was giving a nurse practitioner who was rude yelled at me changed all my medicine doses explain to me she would not send in some of the medicine that I had gotten before and had treated me like I was nothing. even though I'm the one paying her salary. she was rude condescending very obnoxious and unwilling to listen or answer questions. I will be leaving this clinic and going to someplace else I wouldn't send my dog to this clinic just to get a flea bath because they are so rude and acts like they're above us. I would encourage everyone not to go there and if you are going there leave.|I been going to this center for at least 4-5 months and never missed one appointment and I make my physical therapy appointments also and get discriminating concerns that need to be addressed despite customer service which is very poor I'll tell you what else after going there today the Dr says to me if you are late or any minor flaw I'm cutting you off and last time they refused to send a PA to the pharmacy and now I question there tactics because as I said if I make all my appointment and don't miss and do my best why would you threaten me with being cut off and she says knowledge is power umm do you mean FEAR is power ok here is the deal this same Dr I question rather or not she is going to send over my meds to ensure she gets the last laugh rather then being genuine with patience other wise I wait on my pills  I have to suffer for that with pain she also implied that I should see a regular Dr for pain medication I said lady good luck with that POV she was very manipulative and I hope this message gets spread to the right people TY and also you all deserve better then this Evansville the people deserve better|That place is terrible and very unprofessional. They have no compassion or empathy whatsoever. The whole experience is impersonal...they communicate through text messages and you can never get anyone on the phone. I've never had a copayment before but one day one of the workers at the front desk was very rude and yelling and refused to check me in unless I made a $40 copayment...that's just one example of why I hate going there. I don't have the energy to go on and on, I could but I'm so disgusted with this place it's not worth my time.|Worst experience with a medical ""professional"" that I have ever had. The doctor was arrogant, rude and would not listen to me. He felt the need to assure me that since he is a doctor and has taught, that means that he is a better doctor than others. He was completely dismissive of my MRI results and assured me that the pain I was in from an injury 12 years ago was from something that is not there, even though the MRI showed that it clearly was still an issue. Will never go back. The single star is for the staff that have to work with this man.|Who wants go to the doctor? Not me! But eveyone at this facility is kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and capable. The office and surgery rooms are always clean and well lit. Dr McDonnell and Doctor B are highly skilled and diminish any fears I may have with a smile and explanation. I'm unable to name everyone but know I am grateful to have your care.|The single star that I gave them was for the nurse practitioner, she was a good person and had taken care of me for several years previously with my last doctor.
I received a simple cortisone shot for some recurring tendinitis during a bi-monthly medication check up, this was the first time that PMCA  had done my cortisone shot.
,They had recently acquired the practice of my long time pain management doctor after he retired. Like I said, it was a very routine injection that I could have performed myself. I overheard the nurses talking to each other prior to giving me the injection  about the fact that there were no doctors present in the building for whatever reason. . One of them said ""that's OK, we don't need him anyway, go ahead and give him the injection, it's just for tennis elbow"". at the time I didn't think it was a big deal since it  was only a thirty second job. Then I got my bill, they were charging me hundreds for the Doctor and ""procedure"". My entire visit lasted less than a half an hour, even with the injection that the nurse gave me.   Injections  like that were always part of the visit with Doctor Rupert's practice. . Whatever happened to the days when honest work and honest pay meant something? Today's business culture seems to be "" It's OK if you can get away with it "". Goodness knows how much they charged Medicare and my supplemental insurance if my little percentage of it was that much!!! I fired them that same day, my family doctor referred me to another clinic here in town. They are so much better at everything. I'm sure there are people who have good experiences with PMCA, but you need to be aware of what you're getting into. Two years on and they are still trying to send me bills and collections for that day .Maybe I'm old fashioned, but don't believe that a business should profit from that type of behavior.",2025-02-21|2025-01-06|2024-10-02|2025-02-20|2024-12-09|2024-08-30|2024-07-11|2024-05-16,2|5|1|2|1|1|5|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Which Medicare Plans does APCC Of Evansville Accept?","Not sure about medicare but they take medicaid anthem",emergency_appointments|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|rude_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJJ5yc3tcqbogR9LtDdyQMPQI,181

They took the time to get to know us.  Dr. Johnson is awesome and made sure to answer all our questions and lay out a treatment plan. My wife and I had a terrible experience at another local pain clinic. This was the opposite and the example of how they all should be.|I came in 3 x in one week. All appointments scheduled for January 1st were conducted in December - this, 3 straight weeks. It cost more out of pocket because I'm scheduled 2x per month. My Script was sent in on the 18th. I have several serious issues. I can't go three days without meds. My script was due on the 31st of December .On December 27th someone ( I'm assuming it's the person constantly sending my script to the pharmacy who's informed them/and me that they don't have it in stock. So, I always wait to be assured that it's sent to a pharmacy that has the medication in stock. I am scheduled for a 6 am flight out of Evansville on January 1st to California.  The Dr. The Staff. The Nurses all were supposed to send my script in on the 18th of December my 3rd visit in as many weeks to be filled on December 31st. Well it's marked for the 3rd of January (2025). 2 days past the actual due date. This will cause me serious medical harm. Withdrawals without medical supervision is not wise. I tried calling the Answer company . After 2 hours I hired someone to drive me over. And of course the office is closed and no recourse. No emergency back up. No reply from anyone. I had to suffer and stress while going to visit with a sister with a life vest and another who's 71 and in declining health. The 1,300 tickets were non refundable. Lost cause. And not one person from the pain clinic responded. I could have been serious injured and suffered extreme emotional distress. I didn't know what to do. I did my part by coming 3 weeks in a row only to have the Drs office not follow up on the required medical care necessary and agreed to. I've suffered extreme harm. I'm terrified. I'm frozen. I had to pay to be driven over only to be greeted by an empty building. The Answering Rep stated staff were in the office. I paid for 3 straight visits with Shots. And they deliberately and grossly incompetently didn't do what they are charging my insurance for. A terrible, frightening experience. I'm seeking therapy and help. My trust is shattered. Robert Paul Lee. Henderson Kentucky|Dr Johnson will only see you once then every 2 week you'll see a chiropractor, or a counselor. And he will only prescribe Suboxone, a drug used to combat addiction NOT pain relief. In my personal opinion and I could be wrong, a pharmaceutical company or something is paying him good money to push Suboxone cause how else can he afford TWO Rolls Roice cars? Seems strange to me but it's only speculation about that, not fact. But he has advertising for Suboxone everywhere in his office and in the 3 years I saw him he would only prescribe me Suboxone, strange.|Always have a pleasant visit. Everyone I've met is very nice. When I first started I was very worried about my treatment and a nurse named Melisa was extremely helpful she definitely went over and above to assure me I was in good hands. I was very worried about the chiropractor because I was in a lot of pain but she is amazing!! Tasha is always nice and on top of everything. I have been to a few pain clinics and this is by far the best one!|This doctor office has helped me 100% they actually care about how you feel and your concerns actually mean something to these doctors and nurses!

He told me that it couldn't be done that day and I would have to wait 2 more weeks in pain. So I waited. On the day before my appointment to get it done the office called me to reschedule because he was going to be out that day. WHAT??? How are they allowed to treat people this way? Also very arrogant and acts like he doesn't care at all. Get out of pain management if that is the case. Never will I ever recommend him to anyone.  Cant believe he is still in practice.

Went to him for radio frequency Ablation for neck nerves to treat arthritis in my neck causing severe pain. Had exhausted all other forms of treatment and was looking at neck fusion surgery. For some reason Dr Loyd does not use anesthesia for his procedures (just one versed which does nothing!) and the treatment is extremely painful! After enduring treatment on one side of my neck, while I experienced relief the idea of going through another painful procedures again for the left side left me sick at my stomach. So I decided to research other pain management doctors in Lafayette and found that most of them provided anesthesia for this these procedures that made a world of difference! Do not understand why Dr. Loyd didn't offer the same anesthesia- see no reason to put patients through soooo much pain!!???? He also provided me misinformation  on when I could proceed with treatment on the other side of my neck. He told me I had to wait six months to treat the other side and that is completely incorrect. He and his staff were also very standoffish and hurried you through any appointments with very unsatisfactory answers not to mention incorrect information! Staff very cold with no sympathy for people in pain!  Just cannot figure out for the life of me why he would put people through such pain when there are alternatives??? Since my original treatment with him, I have found two other doctors that are extremely well-informed, really seem to care about the pain you've been in, very understanding and sympathetic staff and completed treatment on my other side with very minimal pain and better results than when he treated the original side!!  Still can't believe what he put me through!|Dr. Loyd is so set in his ways and treats each patient the same way instead of a case by case base. He kept insisting on steroid injections for my lower back pain and numbness in my lower extremities from the back pain. Even after several unsuccessful injections he continued to only offer me injections as a treatment plan. I went back to my primary physician who had referred me to him to begin with and explained to her the terrible experience I have had with him over the last year and she wrote me a script for oral steroid pack instead of injections and then ordered some physical therapy and now I follow up with her every couple months and we do a steroid patch and my back hasn't felt this good since before my first back injury and surgery back in 2006!!! I would never step foot in Dr. Loyd's office again nor would I let any of my family or friends go to him for any issues as everyone I know describes the same issues I had with him that he just keeps throwing these injections at his patients that hardily ever relieve any of the pain his patients are having. For a Doctor that specializes in Pain Management he doesn't do a very good job of managing the pain of his patients.....|Dr. Loyd and his staff  are kind, courteous and their procedural skills can and do give their patients back a quality of life.  I trust in the care and help I have gotten and continue to get from Dr. Loyd and his staff.  I am grateful.  Integrity and help and compassion.  Thank you!!|Dr Loyd is a very pleasant and understanding doctor. Explained the procedure and it worked!!  I'm pain free for the first time in five months. Thank you|Dr. Loyd and his staff are very polite, courteous,  and caring. I enjoy my time under his care. I am confident he is doing everything for me when I am there. Scheduled over the phone, got right in,  does what he can to get you in, out, feeling better in no time.|I am real happy with Dr. Loyd and his nurse practitioner , Kaylee,  I have been going eight years for bad disk and SI (sciatica) joint pain.  I do not want surgery.  They found the right combination of drugs  to help relieve my pain!  I get an occasional shot every so often when it starts to act up again.  It is mainly when I over do it.",2023-06-19|2023-03-23|2021-08-06|2013-11-21|2022-06-15|2024-03-28|2022-04-14|2016-08-24,5|1|1|1|5|5|5|5,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|3 p.m.",69.2|58.8|57.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJZSxrUi8dE4gRZS4krqJyRe0,21

So, I get there for my rescheduled first appointment and was told they wouldn't see be because I was late and had received a warning letter. I was late because their address on their website is incorrect. It is there old address, never updated and no one in the office informed me that they had moved.

In my professional career, I must say that I have never been more disappointed. My wife will be having pain pump surgery and Dr. Kundi was selected as the pain management physician to service this Medtronics device.  Awaiting the preliminary punture test, she was given a patch to relieve her pain.  The original dosage needed to be increased.  Five days post administration, she began exhibiting negative reactions necessitating hospital intervention.  One day prior to admission, I called the office to request a brief consult on a first available basis.   I made 4 additional phone requests during her 4 day hospital stay.  Neither Dr. Kundi or his PA returned my call even after I spoke with the practice prior-authorization manager who stated that she had made an ""urgent request"" to both Dr. Kundi and his PA.  I realize that others have submitted strong reviews for this physician and practice and I'm happy that their quality of care has warranted such a response.  However, my wife and I can not report the same level of support.  We have since moved my wife's care to another pain management practice in Carmel.

I have no complaints with my doctor everything has always went very well. Dr. Kundi is awesome with his communication with what he is treating his patient for with your appointment, as well to how I understand what he is doing for my health and well-being. Thanks|All of the providers and staff are friendly. I've found the interns are generally the most thorough out of all of the providers. They seem to listen to my concerns and explain things most often.

I've had a few occasions where my prescriptions were not sent to the pharmacy on time. I once went 5 days without one of my prescriptions and was stuck in bed, unable to move. An opportunity for improvement would be to work on communication. I've found it's really hard to get a hold of the office. They rarely pick up or return phone calls.

The last few visits however have gone well. Dr. Kundi, took the time to listen, gave me recommendations for how to pursue my disability claim, and my meds were sent to the pharmacy immediately. I am grateful that Dr. Kundi's practice is willing to prescribe the pain meds that I need, despite government over-regulation. Thank you.|Dr Kundi is quick and excellent treatment! His bedside manner is wonderful! The office is clean and runs very smooth! I've NEVER had a problem or long wait! I'm glad that I chose to be his patient!|His staff is very helpful friendly courteous and have always been nice to me.  Dr. KUNDi takes his time he makes you understand what's going on he gives you alternatives. He has a sense of humor. And that is truly important when you're dealing with people in pain. Even if you weren't dealing with people and paying doctors should be sensitive and respectful to the patient. I had another pain management Doctor Who was very very unprofessional.   He and his staff would Yell at you and talk down to you. If you didn't like what they had to say they just gave you a notice and said they weren't going to take care of you anymore.

And now my other shoulder is doing the same thing of catching, getting stuck and very painful.Told her my L4 and L5 have slipped out and have arthritis in my back and my entire body. Also Osteoporosis. She then tried to say i was taking Suboxone and pain mens at the same time. I told her no way. If you take both of those at the same time it will put you in withdrawal
She shook her head. She was extremely RUDE! Looking down her nose at me.Acting like I'm a drug seeker
Didn't even care that I have so many medical issues. And she said she's not giving me pain pills until she talks to my Suboxone Doctor. I had also needed a refill of the nerve pain medication Lyrica which she did not refill.And when I called back later that day about the Lyrica, the girl at the front desk said I terminated myself! I told her I did nosuch thing
She said she was asking Dr Sadeki and call me back. Never got a return call. The whole vibe of that office has completely changed from very friendly and caring, to very rude and very judging!!!

He gave me my life back!! Several injections over 2 years and I'd go back there if I ever have that much pain again!!|Have went there for years But one day I called when I woke up and my voice was groggy so they blamed it on the valium!! She said No Valium I said No Problem I Will Get Off It Right Now! Then she wanted to give me a patch I have had patches before and No they don't work and they come off before the week is over with!! Pain patches are a Joke! Guess I will look for a new Dr,!!|Great experiences. Had great results from the treatments. No longer there because I eventually needed surgery that fixed the issue. They offer anesthesia for injections, which I declined. Was no more uncomfortable than the pinched nerve already was. The treatments did give pain relief. Don't waste their time and yours if you just want prescriptions.|Not sure what's up with all the bad reviews.  I've never had a bad experience. Maybe customers are representing themselves in a poor fashion and are getting treated as such. The are usually lots of people when I go in and the waiting period reflects that. I have seen a lot of people go in and out. Some don't even bother to shower or dress nicely for the appointment. You can tell they are there for the pills, and probably get treated as such. Other people who have pain and actually care about their appearance and respect the dr get treated as such too.|Words cannot Express how upset I am with Dr. Pai!
Two years ago I was a patient there and never had a problem. I recently moved back to mishawaka and I ironically enough still have major back pain from blunt force trauma and he has the MRI to prove it!
I had to wait a month to get in his office and for nothing- I have to wait two more weeks for my urine test to come back...TWO MORE WEEKS. Now were at a month and a half of constant pain interfering with my life, my wife and my kids!!
Icing on the cake was I do not get any say in my treatment whatsoever! I have to do physical therapy even though I have done physical therapy in the past and it hurts physically to move my spine...not a good idea!
They also signed me up to see a back surgeon...not something I want to do!
They scheduled me with 30 other people at one time crammed into a very small waiting room on top of it!!
I am talking to a lawyer in the morning! This is not helping me with my pain and it is unbearable!!|I was seen in office 1 time. They forced me to do a drug test even though it was a consult. Then they prescribed medication that I'm highly allergic too. I even dropped off paperwork a few weeks prior to my appointment. Here I am 9 month later and I get a bill for Trilabs for over $3k. They tested my pee and dumped it out. I'm talking to my insurance company about insurance fraud on the offices part.|I am very disappointed with the physician at this facility.i am in line for a reverse shoulder surgery. Their is little knowledge of what pain is prescribed Tramadol and Diclofenac. Tylenol works as well as these meds. Waste of my time and money going there|For an entire year I've tried to get some sort of relief for chronic pain. I need a second shoulder replacement and my body is full of authrytis and scar tissue. Back fusion isn't working very well and my level of life and happiness is hampered.

I am very satisfied with the direction my treatment is going & very happy to have found Dr. Cook.  He takes time to explain things in terms that's easy to understand & if you still don't understand, he will do his utmost best to explain every little part of not only your problem, but of the treatment & the expected outcome of the treatment.  I gave him a 5 star rating, but would like to give him 10 stars or more if possible.|I was pleased with Dr. Cook.He has a pleasant personality , actually communicates and listens to his patient like he cares. That seems to be something rare in today's society and something I for one definitely appreciate. This was my first visit with him.He seems like a keeper! I will update this review as time goes on. A Good doctor deserves recognition and ones that aren't deserved to be called out. Especially since we hire and pay for them.|Absolutely the worst service I have received in the medical industry and any other industry for that matter. They  were supposed to order MRI on January 2nd This is. Feb 12th. Between those dates I found out they never sent the request to my insurance company.  After explaining my frustration as politely as possible they told me they would send it to Putnam County Hospital to get my MRI done instead of the first place and now a week later I have called Putnam County to see if they received the order and they still have not received the order from Dr. Cook's office. Meanwhile, I suffer in pain with absolutely no action from dr cooks office who told me I needed the MRI in the first place. They do not return phone calls when I leave a message ever. Meaning not one single time after seven messages.! Not to mention my minimum wait time in the waiting room is one hour. Strongly advise you find a different pain management doctor if you're not into deep already.|I was always scared to go to a pain management doctor's because I was scared they would prefer to put me on strong pain medication which is not what I wanted. Dr. Cook took his time to listen to what causes my pain and came up with a solution to take scans and then come up with a plan from there. I started coming to Dr. Cook when my doctor retired and she recommended me to him and I see why! Thank you Dr. Cook for listening to me and making me feel like you genuinely care.|Dr.cook is a Excellent Pain Management Professional he cares for his patients and listens and a lovely office has well totally recommend him.|The Dr. walked in an had no clue why I was seeing him that day. I felt like a human lab rat that he wanted to just poke with needles. This Dr has to much on his plate to take it all on . He didn't even read my chart before coming in the room. And didn't have a clue what to do to help me with my  symptoms.|I've NEVER BEEN TREATED SO AWFULLY EVER..
I went for 12 months no issues no dirty drops always showed up..
I had to take my sister for a whole specialized knee replacement in TENNESSEE..
I was not aware we were like in PROBATION AND HAD TO REPORT OUT OF STATE..
They called me for a pill count..
I take sleeping meds so was not awake completely..
I first said I was in terrehout but wasn't I knew she lived there .
I called back after I woke up got the same AWFUL PERSON DEMANDING I CAME IN FOR A PILL COUNT..
I told her I couldn't leave my sister at all.
Her SMART ASS SAID YOU SAID TEERHOT I SAID YES I WAS HALF AWAKE..
She said she didn't care at all and I had till 3 pm to be there
Considering I was 6 hours away awaiting discharge to take my sister home n COULD NOT LEAVE HER..
The RUDE AND UNCALLED FOR UNCARING PERSON TOLD ME I COULD NO LONGER COME..
I called back next am said I worked it out to come..
Hell no she claimed I would be receiving a good bye mailer..
Wow I went into severe depression and couldn't believe this woman..
I found another Dr THANK GOD N WAS STATED SHAME ON HIM!!
As I awaited in waiting room 4 people were talking hell of shit about a DR TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS DR. COOK..
I had no issues with Dr cook or SOPHIA..
My last appointment there 4.5 hour wait they called no one.
They had to open rooms for pt to sit..
SOPHIA WALKED OUT..
When the other DR UP AND LEAVES OVER THE SAME NURSE I HAD TO ENCOUNTER SAYS VOLUMES..
They definitely do NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR EMERGENCIES THAT OCCUR..
They allow people to call in on pts as well
One Dr put it as so...
If THIS IS ALL I DID ALL DAY WAS LISTENING TO MAD PEOPLE ARGUING N LYING ABOUT MY PTS I WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS..
Lesson learned
IF NURSES USE THEIR ENTITLEMENT RUN LIKE HELL
I COULD SEE IF I JAD DIRTY DROPS CAUSED ISSUES NONE OF THE ABOVE!!
They didn't even contact my psychotherapy wow works for them she had no idea
She was in dismay as well|He is a nice enough fellow. But so far I've seen him twice and he says he can get me out of pain but so far is falling short.

The first thing he said to me when he walked through the door was ""what are you doing here?"" After asking for a bridge of medicinal pain relief until surgery, he refused to give me medicine. He said I am ""too young"" (I am 30 years old) and he also called my primary doctor a liar, saying she could give me the pain medicine if she wanted to. I tried to explain that my doctor could not give me pain medicine because of restrictions and because my pain is chronic and Dr. Madupu would not let me speak. He said that his job is not to give pain medicine but to do procedures. I highly recommend NOT seeing Dr. Madupu if you are suffering in pain like I am because he does not care and will not listen to you.|Dr. Madupu is a very understanding Dr. Helped me so much to get my chronic issues under control.

I am surprised at the negative reviews because he has NEVER done anything that is not in my best interest.

And it  "" isn't my job to manage your pain""
When I tried to explain to him my situation (I was in tears by this point) he said he couldn't understand me and he basically dropped me as a patient.
I have Dercums Disease, lupus, fibromyalgia, deteriorated cartiledge in knees, lymphedema and arthritis in my spine and neck.
I've done everything, tried everything for the last 15 years. I finally get a med/treatment combo that works ( was given 21 Tramadol ,50mg twice by his NP)  and then you have a doctor that literally shoots down your Disease as being ""just lipomas"" and refuses to treat you beyond stuff you've already been on for years.

I trust his judgement completely!|Love the Dr. and his team my only complaint is how long things can take sometimes which is no fault of the employees.|We've been coming here for 7 years for my grandfather. As his primary caretaker, it's always felt like a struggle getting him decent care. With the very old and people with chronic pain, doctors are always too willing to throw drugs at people to make them go away without actually listening to them at all. This hasn't been the case with Dr. Bodrab and Suzy, our nurse.  We've never felt like they weren't working towards improving my Grandfather's life. Genuinely listening to any issues he has and concerns. Answering questions, taking their time.

We've only had an issue once or twice with the wait time to actually see the doctor. But even then the staff and service has always been top notch. Definitely recommend.|Dr. Bojrab I highly recommend. He has been so great for each injection I have had. Great personality that shines through in his bedside manner. He is always able to put me at ease before an injection, if you are in need of someone you can't go wrong here!|As many times as I had to call & have my injections for my neck rescheduled, or simply trying to change the appt to a routine check up during all of the Covid-19 & being told I could not change the appt to a routine one & that it had to be only for the injections.
I questioned this numerous times, but they didn't seem to care (let me clarify that - the gals that answered the calls to schedule, change, remind of appts). I could not get any injections per Dr Bojrab & his nurse until I provided them with 'Releases' 1st from all of my dentists I was dealing with since I was having all different kinds of work done on my teeth + the infection was still healing (I mentioned it was quite extensive & could take a bit). I had just finished an antibiotic for an infection in my tooth until we all know how the Covid-19 virus caused many problems for everyone & people who were trying to get into dentist offices, & the like, even for routine work let alone extractions & getting them scheduled was quite a task at times. I finally got 1 of my dental releases & the other was forthcoming shortly  when I get a call stating they are letting me go as a patient since I haven't been seen! I'm like this is a joke right? My goodness I did everything to the book except stand on my head & I've been in serious pain for awhile now begging all the dr's &/or dentists to please get this done so I can get my injections again. A week in a 1/2 or so after they got rid of me, I got my last dental  release I needed but they already said it's ""beyond that, & too late"". So they left me in quite a quandary and suffering! Not happy with this situation especially when I followed their rules to the letter. None of dentists even knew what kind of release they wanted either, nor did I. It's a shame since their office staff in the building was all very helpful & quick to get things rectified. I also asked if notes were put on any of my records & they actually said none were made & they couldn't find any. Wow - I feel real important!|Dr Bojrab and his team are amazing.  I have been going here for years and always find that Dr Bojrab is attentive and caring.  He has a great sense of humor and makes you feel comfortable before your procedures.  I have had many procedures and would not hesitate to refer to him.|My doctor referred me to Dr. David bojrab without consulting me first. Had I looked at his qualifications first I would have realized he was not qualified to deal with all of my pain needs. On my first visit he sent me to another doctor to deal with half of my issues. If you compare his list of specialties to almost any other pain doctor in the area you'll find his list is extremely short. To add insult to injury hIs diagnosis was incorrect. He made No interviewing efforts to get details of my history. He didn't wait for more information before jumping to conclusions. I mean this literally, he did not wait for my extensive records to arrive from multiple sources.     He was clearly in a hurry to get me in and out of the office as fast as possible and this was my intake interview! To the best of my knowledge he did not follow the CDC interviewing guidelines or tapering guidelines as his intent was, without much consideration, to cut me off all medication. His office personnel are visibly hostile to even the simplest questions. The girl acted like I was rude for asking if they had water; a question I only asked because there was no water fountain and I could see their mini fridge full of bottles! I've been going to pain clinics for several years in multiple states and this was almost the worst experience. I recommend Summit Pain Management.

At Summit Pain Management they helped me tackle each area separately. I went from being in a significant crisis of pain to a well managed trajectory of pain control. They introduced me to procedures and medicines that weren't even mentioned with Dr. bojrab. At this point in time I have had a number of injections and ablations that have given me my life back. I am taking far less pills than any point during my crisis. Both he and his nurse assistant turned their back on me. I'm glad they did, because I found a far friendlier office staff and quantifiable help at Summit Pain Management.",2024-10-28|2023-09-27|2024-10-25|2018-01-22|2021-03-10|2020-08-07|2022-04-05|2019-11-13,1|5|4|5|5|2|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJVWr1hKriFYgRO7929cKUgFk,12

Ever. Ive had 2 ablations and several injections including on trigger points. I wont have anyone else! Shes kind, sweet& listens to you. I hope she will be ,"" my person"" for a long time!!|Dr Tolbert listens very well. She is very personable, and very intelligent. I trust her opinion and feel confident with whatever health-care decisions we make.|I could not believe  DR TOLBERT MADE THE COMMENT THAT SHE ""COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY PUT A CAGE IN MY SPINE"" especially when she knew NOTHING OF THE HISTORY OF MY SPINE AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH IT.  What Dr in their proper state of mind puts down other doctors and surgeons for their choice of fixing their patients spinal issues when she knows nothing of the history of the patients spine and spinal problems. What doctor talks about another doctor and the choices they make for their patients. I will tell you what kind, one who is jealous of a higher caliber doctor with stellar skills and chairside manners.  Then she told me that if they are in charge of my meds they are in charge of my procedures.(Dr Tolbert). (I have a top notch Dr. for my procedures)  If they preform the procedures as they do their office visits ex:-- talk at people and not to them, people are not gonna be taken care of properly nor pleased with their performance cause it was a joke.. They won't be touching me with anything period. Big RED FLAG!!!!!!! ANY person with an attitude like this Dr. and the establishment she was at will NEVER TOUCH ME. Especially after reading some of their reviews. They can't be trusted to care for you, if they can't LISTEN TO YOU, whether you're sedated or not they are half ass taking care of you and I SURE DONT TRUST THEM after my visit and how I was communicated with. I wasted my time and theirs too. Dr. TOLBERT told me she would ERASE everything from my visit and I pray she did cause if it affects any of my other visits and she doesn't release me i will seek counsel, my cousin is a doctor, good Christian man he will direct me in what to do. Chairside manners says a ton about a person's character. These doctors need classes on it.  The entire place needs investigated..  Team work makes the dream work. All people respond to different medications differently and again if they can't genuinely LISTEN,  then they can't genuinely give good quality medical care.  What a JOKE SMH!!!!! Please take some courses on communication and how to talk with people. You'd be surprised with the results of some patients. Being kind isn't that hard, but being an ugly person with ugly character doesn't wash off easy either.(1st impressions)Learn to know your place as a professional and being a good doctor will come easy. You are working with the public for heavens sake. Humans, not doormats.. I also feel they should be told ahead of time about the doctors demanding too do the procedures or no meds period. Some people don't have time to waist. I bet though if the tables was turned they'd be taken care of promptly and with great care and compassion. Stop trying to play God with peoples medical conditions. You're not God!!
I grabbed my belongings and I walked out after the doctor told me I was rude. She didn't need to keep asking me questions about my medical if she couldn't serve me any further but she continued to do so.
*Talk about feeling violated.* what was her purpose anyway and for her to call me rude.  Please!! Again know your place as a professional with patients they are humans not objects or doormats for you to treat and talk to or step on through a doctors visit. Pregnant or not there's ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE WHAT SO EVER. PLEASE RELEASE ME SO I CAN SEEK FURTHER ASSISTANCE FROM REAL CARING STELLAR DOCTORS WHO ARE TRULY GENUINE AND SINCERELY CARE. YOU ARE ONLY MAKING ME SUFFER and well we all know how the circle of life works. You put out bad Jojo you get bad Jojo back. Do what is morally correct,and get out of you own feelings for once. Get your big girl britches on and step up a notch to improve your professionalism. Your patients will love and respect you even more and you could become a doctor on a more stellar level as well. I will be praying for you. Please release me cause you didn't help me and I walked out of the appointment due to your less than poor mannerisms. Again
Please release me so I can seek further care from more stellar professionals. Thank you and many prayers.|Dr. Tolbert always takes the time to listen to all of my questions and comments! I never feel rushed and she truly hears me.|Dr Tolbert is a wonderful doctor very knowledgeable and professional. Great bedside manner.

It has been another month now and my records haven't been sent to them.
But besides that, I can never get anyone to answer the phone when I call, even with hitting the different numbers for different options.

Kind, always remember who their patients by name.
I see several different doctors. Dr Shaan Khan is my favorite.
He cares, listens and always looking to solve the issue.
Also, he explains everything throughly.
Thank you|I wanted to say thank you to Dr Khan whom my sister spoke to him about her horrible back pain at a shot procedure and needed help.. You prescribed lidocaine patches ..oh wait you forgot to even send them in to her pharmacy as you and your staff lifted her up from the bed because she couldn't get up on her own. You will be happy to know you denied someone with stage 4 cancer . Who is now on a ventilator help or even pain medication.  You didn't even order an mri of her back all you told her was an xray couldn't show bone on bone with laporte hospital said she had. Within not even two weeks of you seeing her she will be gone so thank you so much for how you treated her.|Dr Khan is a very easy person to talk to. He has a wonderful approach to his patients. I have many medical problems and I
feel he puts 100% into my patient care. I agree with the one woman a few staff members were rude. I believe he replaced some? I don't go there for the staff and as soon as you see him come in and he shake your hand it's all about you. Love this doctor.|For yrs I was seeing Dr Khan, I trusted him. Under his advice I under went many procedures which all failed. Dr khan misdiagnosed me multiple times. I had a lot of unnecessary procedures and in return in particular the SI joint fusion. He referred me to his colleague,  Who did the fusion over in Crownpoint. After the fusion, my pain returned but only worse. Dr khan failed to listen to me and when asked if the SI joint fusion failed he said absolutely not. He told me I needed a full hip replacement . After seeking a handful of doctors and pleading I was eventually referred to IU University. This past March 2024 I underwent an SI fusion surgery yet again Because Dr. Khan and his colleague failed to notice that both left and right SI joint fusions failed and were coming out of the joints. Dr khan failed me as his patient. I trusted him as a doctor and trusted his advice which in return failed me. I posted a picture To prove my story.|I met Dr Khan a couple time very nice doctor. But today had a bad experience my partner had an appointment today drove over 40 minutes and find out that her appointment was canceled and reason was given that she canceled an epidural gave the hospital 24hr noticed because she suffer from heavy depression and wouldn't be able to go through with the procedure she also had a follow up appointment and communicated to the NP that she like to see him and agreed to keep the appointment as it was. So today we were told by a stone face receptionist your appointment is canceled and you done!. Lately, it seems that bad staff's beings short and curt no compassion whatsoever and  playing God with patients.|Doctor Kahn is the best! I have seen him for years now. He always did whatever he could to help me control my pain. He went above and beyond many times for me. He never gave up and gave me some much needed hope. After we put in tons of hours days and years fighting for insurance to approve my pain pump.  I'm no longer in excruciating pain! And it's all do to Doctor Kahn!|Dr. Kahn is fantastic, but his scheduling department is terrible. My partner had 2 surgeries needed. The one last month they forgot to schedule her, today they never call back to give her the time of the surgery.|Very well educated.

Wait times were insane which is hard when you are sick and in pain. When I asked about using a cervical collar for a few hours, here and there, because it actually relieves my pain. I was told ""no"". Pushed into steroid injections which you should know are NOT FDA approved and have NOT been studied in patients long term. Also, I have Type 1 Diabetes. The shots made my blood sugar insane for several months. Impossible highs. You shouldn't be giving steroids to those who are diabetic. I got thrush so bad in my mouth and down my esophagus that I could not eat. I had to be on Diflucan for 3 months to get rid of this complication.  I also suffered reduced kidney function for 3 months. I had an undiagnosed Adrenal tumor at time. Common sense says that you should NOT give steroid shots to someone with this condition as Adrenal tumors are known to cause steroid excess in the form of cortisol. 5 months later I was diagnosed with Adrenal Cancer. In my opinion, this is just another drill mill. It's scary to me that doctors are no longer managing pain.

Today was my first time in Dr Taylor's office and I don't ever wanna go anywhere else!! I have had severe lower back pain for 4.5 years. I have had 1 surgery on my L4/L5 for a herniated disk 3 years ago. Since then it's been hard to find a doctor who not only takes me seriously (I'm a 30 year old female who often gets told I'm too young to have the serious back issues that I have). From the moment I walked into their office the staff greeted me and were super nice and friendly, the nurse who took me back to the room was extremely kind and sympathetic and really listened to what I have gone thru the last almost 5 years and communicated with me like I was family even tho I had never been seen there before. Then in came Dr Taylor... and I have NEVER been seen by a doctor who actually took the time to LISTEN to me and what I've had done and what I've been going thru and experiencing like he did without rushing thru the appointment to get to the next patient. He was super friendly and talked to me like a friend and even took the time to educate me more on my MRI scans and pinpointed which of my discs are causing which issues I'm experiencing (I now have 2 bulging discs L4/L5 & L5/S1). He showed me demonstrations on how my last epidural was done (elsewhere) and how this one will be done differently to better help with the nerve pain I'm experiencing.

I am blown away with the care I received today. Best experience I have EVER had in ANY Dr office setting. The compassion that this office has for their patients is out of this world. I thanked them all, but words cannot express how much it truly meant to be seen and HEARD and immediately have a plan set to help me. I am so grateful for this office and the way they treated me during my visit. 20/10 would recommend!!! I am confident when I say I finally feel like I'm in good hands and look forward to being their new patient.|This review is about my only treatment so far by Dr. Taylor.  I have chronic, spine and sciatic issues and it did take me almost a month of  enduring severe pain before I could get in to see  him.   That is my only complaint.  I finally got in and he scheduled an epidural for 2 days later.  The staff at Ball Outpatient Surgery was good.  Dr Taylor's treatment was fantastic.  He came to see me before the procedure, reviewed everything and even chatted with me.  When it was my turn, I was whisked into the surgery theater and he explained everything he was doing.  I have had four previous epidurals and endured various levels of pain, even with an anesthetic infusion.  Based on his assurances, I opted to go with local anesthesia only.  I was nervous, but he did a fantastic job.  There was no terrible pain and only mild discomfort that lasted seconds.  I was so happy I opted to go without and IV.  I would gladly do this again as long as he is the one doing it.  He also does minimally invasive surgery of which I am a big believer.  He showed me an option for a more long-term solution, should I need it.  At this point, I am very pleased and will put my faith in him going forward.|I love Dr Taylor wish I could use him and his staff for all my medical issues. The Spine surgeon gave up on me said my fusion is healed  and sent me back to Dr Taylor who already tried an epidural after the fusion that didn't help but the spine surgeon says nothing is wrong he wanted Dr Taylor to put in a pain stimulator. Dr Taylor could but he agreed there's something wrong and sending me to another surgeon.|I started seeing Dr Taylor around 2009/2010 because of some nerve damage from a back surgery. He listened to my problem's and pain issues and set me up with the pain stimulator. It has helped me exceptionally well and was a life changer. I would recommend him to anyone and now both of my parents are seeing him with back issues and also my father in law. The whole staff is caring and friendly. If you have chronic pain or any kind of pain hopefully you can get in to see Dr Taylor.|Dr. Taylor is the best doctor I've ever had in my life. He and his staff are so caring and not judgemental. Dr. Taylor was sent from God to me. I've just had injections in my spine yet the pain is not gone but it is at least 50% better and that is amazing in my book due to my amount of pain. If I could rate this man a 1,000,000 I would.|Dr Taylor is amazing. I had melanoma skin cancer removed and had alot of pain. From my first visit he treated me and put a drg stimulator in me and I'm doing so much better. Just healing from the surgery part. Thank you again Dr Taylor and your staff. God bless you all.|My dad is 90 and has excruciating back pain and just started seeing Dr. Taylor about 9 months ago. Dr. Taylor set a pain management plan in place for dad where he gets pain shots every 3 months. Dr. Taylor is a very caring doctor. Definitely recommend him!|So far, I am very happy with Dr. Taylor and his staff. It took me a long time to get in to see him due to insurance issues but I felt like a weight was lifted when I finally saw him. I constantly feel as if medical professionals either don't listen or make me feel like the pain I'm feeling is just in my head but I didn't feel that way at all at his office.

He's big on educating his patience. Every single visit he will go over the material to make sure you understand you can ask him any question he will answer it he ends every appointment by telling you if you have any questions don't hesitate to call. I've currently gone through a very tragic events in my life the office staff and Dr M have been caring and amazing . Doc offered words of encouragement he truly cares.
I want to address some of these bad reviews. If you're not willing to put the work in and you're only trying to come to this office to get meds this is not the place for you. If you want to learn about pain how it affects both your body and your mind, or how underlying issues can exasperate pain and how to help ease it or fix it this is the place for you. As far as raising a voice at a patient I will say this. Dr m is human . It's not right for someone to come into your home and scream at you just like it's not right for someone to walk into his office and scream at him and his staff. When you read these reviews just remember there's two sides and you are getting aside of someone who is upset possibly not getting their way. If you're considering a doctor to help with pain this is the doctor.|My first time seeing Dr. Masimore was today. In less than 2 hours he gave more info than any doctor I've ever seen. He also took the time to explain everything in great detail and didn't  run in the room and spend 5 minutes and leave like most doctors in the past have. He was very thorough with his exam and getting to know myself and my conditions. I don't believe the negative reviews one bit. If you do what you're supposed to there should be no problem! The office staff was also beyond polite and helpful! 5 stars!|Let me start off by saying I was not his patient my husband was until he passed away in Dec 2023. I went to each appointment, though. The office staff is friendly and easy to get along with. We had issues with my insurance not paying, and they didn't hound me about it they said they were working on getting it fixed. You do wait a short period before seeing the doctor, but in my experience, you do no matter what doctor you see anymore. Dr. Masimore is a very intelligent man. He was nothing but informative and helpful to my husband and myself. He is very keen on making sure you're taking your medications as directed and not abusing them. Which is great because so many people nowadays are addicts. He was always willing to adjust his medication as needed if it was necessary. My husband had decompensated liver disease and was struggling with many complications of his disease. Dr. Masimore would always take time to go over what the struggles were since the last visit and try to give any advice or education he could to help. I appreciate the helpfulness and compassion that he had for my husband during the last year.|I have never been treated so badly by a doctor...He talks the whole time...and if I tried to answer he cut me off...He tries to intimidated and bully you....I didn't agree with him and he labeled me uncooperative...Said he Cldnt help me...then proceeded to degrade me in waiting area and say u can come back....I said no ty! This man who has a God complex is arrogant and verbally abusive...NOBODY DOES THAT TO ME....Btw the staff was so nice and u can tell they tip toe around this angry man...They were so apologetic for his behavior....I left and sat and cried in my car!|Just want to start off by saying I have been a patient of Dr. Masimore around 8 years. Of all the doctors I've encountered personally and in the work place, he is genuinely the nicest and most compassionate person I've ever met. Dr. Masimore  is very knowledgeable and competent in his practice and well rounded in general health care. As Dr. Masimore says, pain medicine is not the solution but is sometimes necessary to support the patient needs. Dr. Masimore has helped me understand my injuries and best alternative practices to mitigate my discomfort. I.E.- stretching , breathing exercises , ice/heat, topical gels, injections and support braces.

I could go on and on with how great Dr. Masimore is, and the positive impacts he has had on my life and others. It's very seldom a happy patient comes to write a review for a their provider. I would like to address the bad reviews on here. I've seen a variety of people in and out of Masimores office over the years , and it's typically the same type of patients. These doctors are under a microscope nonstop and have strict guidelines and regulations to follow. If you can't follow the simple rules in place, then your service can't continue. That being said, Dr. Masimore is very understanding and able to help you, but he can only do so much before it is recognized and has to be escalated. I can promise you this, the disgruntled patients had several opportunities for improvement before escalation took place. To simply summarize my post, if you can follow the rules; Dr. Masimore will be your best pain management solution. If you would like to ask any questions, feel free to respond to my post. Thank you.|I have been a patient of Dr. Masimore for almost a year now! He's great & I HIGHLY recommend him! I haven't had any issues whatsoever. I actually enjoy my appointments and talking with him and his staff. I'm usually always in and out because I do early appointments. I have a back disease I was born with and Dr. Masimore actually knows about the disease itself and what I'm going through! Most doctors I have seen in the past don't know much about the disease I have! In fact, I recently found out he doesn't take my insurance and I told him I will pay out of pocket to continue to go there. So you know I like him if I want to pay out of pocket, rather find another doctor that is covered by my insurance! I'm very thankful that he is giving me that option because I plan on using him for my doctor always!|I have been a Patient of Dr. Masimore for about 5 years and wouldn't trade him for anything. He truly cares about his Patients, and takes time to listen and understand their concerns. I recently came down with Shingles, and the pain is debilitating. I was ready to go to the hospital, but called Dr. Masimore first. He faxed in the medication to treat Shingles, and within 24 hours I felt a significant difference in my level of pain, and I am now able to walk without so much difficulty. And although I still have pain, it is no longer a 10..A good Doctor is hard to find, but I found one with Doctor Masimore. I wouldn't hesitate to refer him to anyone.|Not sure why there are so many bad reviews on here, Dr Massimore and the staff has been nice and caring towards me. Only been there about 4 months but I haven't run into any issues with them. The staff are really nice and are very helpful if you need something.

I was sent paperwork to fill out ahead of time and told to arrive 30 minutes before the appointment. I did so, and I was treated very rudely when I arrived, being told that I would have to be rescheduled again because I didn't arrive an hour before the appointment time, and then being told by the receptionist that the person on the phone shouldn't have told me that. The receptionist was equally rude to the officer manager. I don't trust this office with my care, and yes, the Shore Drive office reeks of cigarette smoke.|They DON'T answer the phone at the Westside location on Shore Drive. They receptionist DON'T do their jobs!
A referral was signed by the Dr. 2 weeks ago and they have not sent it over to the other doctor.
The people I speak with are not in the clinic , they're support staff so you can NEVER talk to anyone in the clinic. It's RIDICULOUS!
If your insurance pays for you to go somewhere else I recommend you do so!!!|I was told to arrive at 8 am for a 9am appointment, and I did so. I watched several people come in after me and go before me. I walked up to check in counter and noted my paperwork still sitting on her desk. She said I can't send you back before your apt, which was at 9am. It's now 937am and she just put my paperwork in to be seen. Very unprofessional, and it smells like cigarettes in offoce here. They didn't apologize and I can not recommend this place. 2 more were called back that came in while I was writing this and were taken back. Also, I seldom give a bad review, but she acted too rudely to me and didn't apologize as if this was OK. I will be informing the MD!!
update the exact same receptionist did it AGAIN. She said your appointment isn't until 9am even though they say be here at 8am. I was also the first one to arrive and 1st one to fill out and turn in paperwork. They then called back 3 people before me stating my Dr Jei wasn't in yet. Once back, I inquired about Dr Jei arrival and was told he was here. This receptionist told the entire office infront of me and loudly that I told her I was letting the Dr know, which I did, again. I am not sure why they allow this ridicule and hostile bullying if patients they don't like when we confront them over not putting our charts up to be seen in order of arrival and let our appointment time.
I'd like management to call me to discuss this.|My first, second and third experience with this company seemed very dysfunctional. My family doc referred me to this business for a neurology consultation. They mailed me a packet and scheduled me an appointment for the west location. I took the day off work for them to let me know they canceled my appointment and I would have to reschedule. The second day I took off and arrived at my appointment for them to tell me the appointment was at the east location. The secretary at the west office used white out to cover up the initial appointment and wrote in my next appointment at the east location. This is now the third day I have taken off work for the secretary to tell me I didn't have an appointment so she referred me to the pain management secretary to also tell me I indeed had No appointment. After them passing me back and forth they told me they found my appointment and it for next week!!!! I refused to take another day off work. I told them neurologists are a dime a dozen in this town and I'm pursuing another doctor that hopefully is competent enough to set my appointment and stick with it. Very unprofessional.|I have been going to this facility for almost 3 years now. However, This morning I had an appointment for an emg. The nurse comes and gets me and walks me to the room & it is not clean. She said I'm sorry excuse me and leaves me in the hallway while she continues to ""clean"" the room. I said okay and walked back to the lobby and she takes me back to the same room. It hadn't been wiped at all. The table was dirty, the bed had blood on it, and I said something to her and she just said ""mhhmmhhhmmm"" and I was like that was rude & she responded with I wasn't talking to you I was talking to the computer. (Conveniently)
Then Dr. Kundi comes in and says Michelle since you're having OCD let's change you to a follow up. I felt awful. It was as though I was the one being punished and I hadn't done anything except for advocate for myself. So I go to take my drug screen and went to put the cup in the compartment in the wall & I realise there's a name on another cup but not mine? I found this odd and mentioned it to the staff. One of which swore it would just be okay. I did file a complaint with the other office because this office won't do so. Today's appointment was super stressful on my body. Which in turn caused me to be in more pain. Dr. Kundi is usually super sweet but today was stern and standoffish. I get told they're swamped but that is not my fault. I am still a patient and human as they are. I stayed as calm as I possibly could under the circumstances. But the unprofessionalism I experienced today was completely uncalled for.|I have read all of the poor reviews on here and I'm confused. The only thing I would at all agree with is the answering of phones, but I've only ever the best interactions with the front office staff. Melissa Anthony has been handling my care and I'm extremely happy with it. I feel like she is the first doctor to actually listen to my concerns. Dr. Kandi has been very kind as well.
I have suffered with multiple chronic pain diseases for a number of years and I finally feel like I've found a place to help.|Very caring and very professional  Takes the time to explain my care.   Dr Kundi has improved my quality of life immensely.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The front desk is one of the nicest lady's I've ever spoken to.   OUTSTANDING care.|The most ghetto office I've ever been to in my life. It use to be so nice. They talk about their personal problems openly and the office manager can't even handle a complaint as he can't speak English so it's impossible to get through to him. You can get your medication though and Dr Jay is very nice",2025-01-22|2025-01-02|2025-01-08|2023-08-23|2022-10-05|2021-12-08|2018-12-04|2022-04-01,1|1|1|1|1|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Does anyone else have a devil of a time contacting them?

He saw Dr. Kazi and got an injection. We couldn't have been more happier now that he is pain free. Kudos Dr. Kazi.|I had started with Dr. Khazi Nov 2nd 2023 when I went to office I was without care due to my Dr of 5 yrs office was closed by hospital.

I told the office I was out of my script and had been without that substance that I took for 2 yrs. I hadn't had any procedures since may 2023 when the office closed.  When I went for consultation I told nurse I felt I was detoxing from meds and did not feel great.

Dr khazi prescribed a new regiment for me and I started that. By the 10th I called them saying I felt terrible. More side effects than benefits. They took me off this med and got me right in to change it up. Then a 2 wks later  (1 mth since first visit) I go in. Nurse was rudely and obviously talking to front desk ab why I was there. This appt was scheduled by them and khazi asked to see me in 2 wks but nurse said when I approached desk, ""we are trying to figure out why you are here bc we can't bill your insurance every two wks. I said I had a severe reaction so he wanted to see me back in 2 wks. So they finally took me back. I said I have a terrible rash and I am not sure why. Dr khazi said you are reacting to the meds still. Took me off all and put me on a steriod.  It was Dec 14 now and I was finally feeling like myself. But pain from inflammation continued to increase while my condition was not managed. I get a text and call from my pharmacy saying Dr khazi called in my old script that I detoxed from in Oct but he only sent script for one pill. We've called them but it says their office is closed from 15th to 2nd of Jan. They did not get it fixed. Jan 2nd I called office as I asked in voicemail what date of my follow was that I lost card. No response to voicemail  on 3rd... called but no answer 3rd. Called 4th no answer. Called 5th no answer and I left another voicemail upset stating I thought my doctor would want to see me after having 2 major reactions to medication. That maybe I need a new doctor. They never returned call and they've refused to forward my records or no response states that message.

Do yourself a favor find a real specialist that cares about their patients wellbeing. More often than not you cannot talk to anyone and have to leave a vm. They did not respond to any messages. They botched the mri request and hospital had to ask them to fix it. They are not professional and they do not put the patient first.|I use to like Dr. Kazi, that until recently. Before I went on vacation I had 0 balance but when I came back my bill was over 400 dollars. I went to speak with the office about it and they absolutely refused and told me to call billing. Umm or not. I called my insurance company, because I was told my injection was covered which it technically wasn't. Which was never told to me. And this happened back in March but didn't get billed until recently. Not too mention you can't ever get anyone on the phone he's always short staffed and the staff he does have are lazy and rude. And he continuously wants to injection you and give you drugs. I don't even like to take my meds as it is. And I forgot to mention that I went for my appointment 1 day and the office was closed all because he was under staffed but didn't call his clients to inform them not to come and I was not the only client in the parking lot wondering what the heck. 

No I'm not mad about paying my bill. I'm mad about how when I went on vacation I had 0 balance and than ended up somehow having a over 400 dollar balance after returning from my trip. And not 1 person wanted to explain to me why. Besides saying call billing. I shouldn't have to your office should be able to answer these questions. And what makes me even more upset is the fact I was told the injection was covered and approved, not only discounted. That should have been explained to me before the injection. That injection was back in March and was sent to my insurance in June. Make that make sense. I had to find all this out by insurance company. Very frustrating and disappointing that I had to even leave a bad review. A simple request to answer my questions in person would have been helpful and much appreciated. Thats all I asked for. And considering the fact I was on the clock to come speak face to face about my bill and you and your staff couldn't even do that. And just an FYI I have never got upset about paying my bill ever. Thank you for your time Dr. KAZI which you'll probably ignore my email but respond to my review.

Ps my insurance company has sent in an adjustment
Have a wonderful rest of your week.|I was referred to this guy, I was awaiting major surgery on my right ankle in October and saw him for pain management.  His staff never returns phone calls, will not issue prescriptions without paying your bill in full, and several other issues.  No matter what response he provides to this review I will never see him again.  Save yourself a lot of headaches and find another doctor.|I started seeing Dr Kazi about 9 months ago. He listened to my issues and there are many! He came up with a plan, gave me options and then executed his plan pursuant to my wishes. After having back pain for 20 plus years, I finally have relief after a minimally invasive procedure was done.

When there was a procedure I did not want, he listened and did not pressure me to get it done. When I had a severe migraine for days, he had me come to the office without an appointment and gave me a treatment that got me past the headache. I could not be happier with Dr. Kazi and his staff. Jamie and Emily are compassionate, caring and understanding, as is all of the Dr.'s staff. I have never had any issues with these guys. They have been a godsend.|Dr. Kazi cured my headache! He is the way Doctors should be: honorable, honest, and having just good wholehearted intentions for the benefit of his patient's overall health. I had the longest headache I've ever experienced in my entire life. It was so awful and lasted for hours on end! After he asked me a couple of questions he gave me two medications. The first medication he gave me was apparently the latest and best thing on Earth. A very expensive medication (I looked it up afterwords). Unfortunately that didn't change anything with my headache, but he had free samples so that medication didn't cost me a cent! Finally gave me the second medication called zipsor; FOR FREE TOO!!! Thank you Doctor Kazi! In less than 20 minutes the most miraculous thing happened; MY HEADACHE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED! I've never had a headache like that, and I've never had a headache last so long before either. Having it cured like that so quickly was nothing short of righteous! Ever since Dr. Kazi cured me I haven't had one yet and I thought I would leave this review. Dr. Kazi is an extremely kind gentleman who follows all the rules and who cares about the people he's entrusted with. I have faith that he will continue to help many other people in the future and I am just so grateful I got to meet a doctor like him. He truly is the way doctors should be|Dr. Kazi has been very professional and respectful to me. He is a joy to talk to and he listens! He did not jump into diagnosing me until he did multiple diagnostic testing. He did not try to cover the pain, but he tried to diagnose the pain and find out my reasoning for it. I praise God for finding this doctor for me. His staff has been  nothing but kind and respectful to me. I would recommend him to others with no problem. It is great having a doctor who cares.|Would recommend to anyone! He's gained control of my migraines and the shots I get for pain relief are working wonders! I left his office after an issue with staff but I had to come back because no other Dr compares! They are fixing staff issues but other than that this is THE BEST PAIN DR AROUND!",2024-08-25|2024-02-16|2023-08-23|2022-10-03|2020-12-22|2022-09-18|2019-09-08|2022-12-14,5|1|1|1|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJGdNzEJHRFogRL0rR7-BFqxw,40

Dr. Kowlowitz to anyone! This man is completely out of line and absolutely rude. The way he treated my grandmother was absolutely unacceptable. He completely lacks compassion and empathy for his patients. He don't listen to what his patients are saying in fact He would not even let her talk, he just kept interrupting her, calling her a liar. He was shouting so loud everyone out in the waiting room could hear him. If you are looking for a doctor that you can connect with and that understands you and your situation then I would suggest finding a different doctor.|Discharges patients for no reason. Even with acute pain and recovering from surgery. Jennifer Emmert doesn't listen or care. I was denied care. And they do not answer phones after hours. This place is a scam. Jennifer treats everyone like an addict. All I wanted was a hip injection. What is so addictive about that? These so called doctors are only in it for the money. There is no compassion or empathy.  Jennifer has no idea what she is doing. Maybe some patient care services training is in order.  Don't waste your time or money. Jennifer assumes everyone just wants pills...Jennifer  - I wanted a shot in my hip!!! How dare you call me an addict. Shame on you. I am suing for defamation.|This man??  was the anesthesiologist for my surgery. I met with him twice prior to surgery and he assured me that he had treated many patients with my condition, which is a rare condition. I was a naive patient but I knew the questions to ask and he had all the right answers. He tells you what he wants to, which is the protocol for a patient's condition.. My surgeon told me after I faced many difficulties following surgery that this so called Anesthesiologist, for whatever reason, did NOT FOLLOW THE NECESSARY PROTOCOL. Now I face many more unnecessary medical difficulties because of his incompetence.|At my trail I felt relief go to my arms and was totally surprised. Afterwards I realized that I still needed better control. Then I was transferred to Dr Kim
Who after reviewing charts was very uncomfortable with amount of meds in my damage location. Back to Dr K, ,his  adjustments with pump PM gave big relief when boost was used. 1st time I felt like I had some control.Good Job|I'm not sure where I reviewed him already but I was legally declared disabled by SSDI this man questioned it I haven't worked in 10 yrs and am forced by my insurance to go to him. So apparently every Dr I saw before was wrong.  This man has a God complex and zero empathy cause apparently only he knows. At this point I pray he just let's me get my RFA then I will go out of network cause I'm not asking for drugs just a Dr that helps. He NEVER even introduced himself I didn't know his name til this survey|Save yourself lots of time and $$ by avoiding this place at all costs. The ""Dr"", ""Anesthesiologist"" or whatever titles she claimed to hold, came across as snooty and lacking any compassion for my situation. Didnt even bother to introduce herself upon walking into the room. Judging by her appearance, i could tell immediately where her priorities lay. She showed absolutely no concern for my pain, and when I left I felt like i had just left a car dealership. The place is just concerned with one thing. You guessed it...the ring of the cash register!|I had gone through years and years, surgical procedures after surgical procedures at OrthoIndy. Then I was recommended to Dr. K. by my PCC. I was very skeptical going to a new pain management and the thought of starting from scratch again. But that didnt happen. His team started treating me and FINALLY a Dr that got to the root of my problem. Today I am pain free and hugged this man. I was so happy to get the relief I had been needing for so long. Highly recommend this group.|I've been going here for awhile and am happy with the treatment.  You have to realize how these Dr's hands are tied with pain management laws.  The Gov't has gone way too far to fix a ""problem"" that isn't with patients going to certified Dr's and taking meds as prescribed, It's with ""patients"" seeking out pain meds on the street and not realizing that they can be mixed with Fentanyl.  Or ""patients"" going to heroin because they aren't getting the high anymore from a couple of opioids. We just have ro hope the Drs are treating their patients as best as they can within all these new ""opioid crisis"" laws.  And that's what the Center for Pain Manager does.

Update- it's 10 days later and she misses her appt by 1 hour due to the poor scheduling issues by the clinic.

We find him to be very knowledgeable, and yes very serious. He has absolutely done everything that he knows to help my husband. He has been kind to us.

The pain clinic where we live is a pill mill. We wanted help, not more pills to get addicted to. We came to deaconess and glad we did. Treating chronic pain is so hard to figure out and Dr Harries has tried so hard with my husband. Yes, some Doctors do not have great bedside manners, but the level of care is what we're looking for.|This is an update. I called to make an appointment to see Doc Frank only to be told he is no longer with West Side pain Clinic.

I have had such a improvement in my life since I started seeing him some SIX years ago. They will not say what happened to him, to me that implies it was not his choice. He will be missed at the West Side. Love ya Doc :(
As a side note Frank is still in Evansville.|They're very professional and have never let me down . Thank you Dr. Aziz .    Patient R. Givens|Worst experience with a doctors office I've ever had. I'm fully aware I need to lose some weight but I've never had any back issues prior to this. I had an accident 4 months ago and I'm dealing with a lot of lower back and hip pain. Dr Harries basically told me I need to lose weight and because I have hypothyroidism there's nothing they can do besides have me lose weight. I have a compression fracture on t12 and a bulged disk between l4 and l5. He tried to send me for an MRI of my brain for a ""pituitary gland tumor"" because I have hypothyroidism and a sleep study. I don't sleep well because of pain, not because I have sleep apnea.  Absolutely a waste of my time. I will never go back. AVOID AVOID AVOID if you don't want to leave in tears.|Suffer from Trigeminal Neurapathy or facial pain. My life completely changed after a routine dental procedure when my wisdom teeth were removed. Went to several doctors in St. Louis and was like a zombie due to all the drugs given to me. I believe my doctors gave up. Heard of a special procedure that can be done to the facial nerves from a lady in Australia, who has the same condition as me. This lead me to Dr Macdonnell and Deaconess Pain Management.
I can not say enough good things about Dr Macdonnell and the whole staff really. He thinks outside the box and genuinely cares. I had a somewhat unusual surgery last year and have improved a lot. I don't know where I would be if I had not met these great people.|Worst experience with a doctor by far. He only recommended neck infections for a vertebrae being moved out and slightly twisted. My insurance wouldn't approve them because they said it is not medically necessary. Doctor Sridhar Bhaskara, MD told me there are no other options and to come back when I have a better job with insurance or when I get better insurance that will approve them. Saying all this without even telling me how much said injections are or asking if I could even afford them. Very degrading. This place is a joke!|If I could give this place a 0 I would. I have been prescribed medication for osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, several bulges, a bone tumor in my shoulder, and stenosis down my entire spine. The doctor basically said my pain was due to anxiety and depression. I have ALWAYS had anxiety and depression and that is being treated by a doctor who is qualified to make decisions about my mental health, NOT Dr. Harries. Don't waste your time going here unless you like being treated like garbage and sent out the door untreated.",2024-11-11|2021-03-01|2020-08-18|2024-10-22|2021-08-11|2017-01-12|2021-09-07|2021-10-14,1|5|5|5|1|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ7z8vNWjTcYgRZoncjXSml1c,26

Very quick but thorough and always listens to your concerns and polite. Highly recommend. Also respect having to be accountable for meds/ Tests.Also he truly cares and has resources if there is a problem instead of just handing out drugs and sending you on your way which I experienced last few Dr's I've interacted with. Much respect for him and his staff. Always been a pleasant experience for me personally|I have been seeing Dr feng since he was my family Dr. He is knowledgeable and is good to me always.|If not for Dr Feng & Stacey Engle I would not be the mother or person I am today they have been with me every step of my almost 4 years in sobriety, also adding this is the longest I've ever been clean! They are very in tune with their patients as well as get to know them on a personal level! They ask about my kids all the time & my successes that I've achieved in my time with them! I'll never go anywhere else for my treatment & the 1 time I did I was done so wrong & immediately got back to my original treatment Doctor which was Dr. Feng! These people helped me become a person I thought I could never be again & for this I'm forever grateful! I have recommended them to many people & will continue to do so because I truly believe they care & want to help people!

PS these people who I've been with since the beginning give me more hell than I ever deserved for having the length of sobriety I have & I feel so sorry for anyone that he's throws out to the wolves because while moving from 1 town to another he felt it would be best not to give me a script to hold me over until I could see my doctor even after seeing & explaining that I'd had enough of the awful treatment & this is Dr. Feng's doings. I hope he's very proud of his self because he left me to have withdrawals, seizures, & even more but I won't go into any more details. I will WARN ANYONE WGO GOES HERE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HAVING BO RESPECT FOR YOU, YOU'RE LIFE OR IF YOU DIE OR NOT!|Have been treated professionally and with respect for years.  I understand wait times can be long, but if you are a good patient and honest, you are treated with respect and dignity. I owe a lot to Dr Feng for saving my life and taking me on as a patient. The NPs are great too!|For those who actually follow the rules, and aren't there to abuse the dr, it's a wonderful resource. Dr Feng is thorough,  clear instructing, and patient.  He actually cares! Some of the previous NPCs are no longer there, but it's still an incredible resource.|As other reviews has started, this office is not for the chronically disabled/ill. Even if your primary physician refers you to this clinic, in our experience, it is purely due to them accepting your insurance. They ""manage medication not pain"". They promote this in their patient bill of rights that their patients are treated with dignity and respect. That appears far from the truth. Instead a veteran was treated as an addict- without his knowledge mind you-  verses a patient that is prescribed opioids for pain management. This will  now be in his medical history, and potentially affect his experiences in other medical facilities that may have access to these notes/documentation. What is frustrating is that after the initial appointment ethically Dr.Feng and his nurse practitioner had an obligation to inform the patient that he was not a proper candidate for their scope of practice. Instead, they proceeded to prescribe an opioid that is specifically created for opioid addiction- not for chronic pain. After extended use of said prescription, pain was still unmanaged and little solution was provided. After seeking a second opinion, we began to ask questions regarding to why they felt this specific drug was appropriate only to learn his status as an addict per their charting. I find this behavior negligent, appalling, and unprofessional. I seriously recommend if you are seeking a pain clinic for a disability or illness- this is not the place for you.|They're the best pain Management group I have ever been to. I usually schedule mornings so there's no wait. Stacy Engel is the nurse practitioner who takes care of me and she says sweet and caring, she takes care of my needs for pain. Would recommend this place to anyone.|Not professional. Like to accuse my spouse of steeling my medication. As he stated hi staff are always right and the patient is always wrong.  I believe his practice on State Road 135. Opioid management group needs to be investigated.

I have experienced on numerous visits to see my provider. Having been less than 10 minutes past my slotted appointment time, the front staff needs to understand the complicated and malfunctioning processs we as patients must go through before we arrive at the clinic. First, the parking lot is repeatedly full in both regular and Handicapped parking spots, with overflow parked alongside the curbs in both front, side, and rear locations, with numerous cars waiting while idling to get the next available spot. Second, although tge online checkin is my preferred, partially bc I can thereby avoid the front desk receptionists, the Kiosk at the front door to the reception area appeared to be malfunctioning and wouldn't accept my input. So as my last option, which used to be my first when the clinic was on 2nd Floor, I went to the counter and was received with ""We may have to reschedule your appointment..."" followed by a snarky redhead at the end of the counter. The same redhead that was complaining out loud about having to work, I overheard while waiting for my appointment with Karla last time! Perhaps, it might be time the front desk receptionists perform a different task within the office. Unfortunately, negativity is contagious, as is positivity, and I shouldn't have to leave for my appointment earlier than I already do. I realize these are difficult times, but when the clinic was on 2nd Floor, sharing the office with PT, the reception area was filled with positivity, smiles, and friendly receptionists, of which I often smiled and said ""Thank you for being so nice!"" Not quite sure why that has changed, other than experience has taught me that it only takes ""one bad apple"" to ruin the cart. Thank you Dr. Patel and Karla Stapes for the service you provide us.|Checking in was simple and easy.  The staff was extremely friendly.  My nurse (Shara) was pleasantly nice.  Dr. Xu walked me through the procedure, asked plenty of questions regarding my current pain and past pain. The procedure (epidural C5 / C6) itself was pain free.|Maddie was wonderful. Very kind listening to all our concerns and sent us in the right directions for pain relief.|I have been a patient at this clinic for over 6 years.  Originally, I felt as if their service and treatment was adequate.  About a couple years ago things started to go downhill very quickly.  It started taking forever to get anything done and every appointment took far too much time.  In fact about 2 years ago I arrived for a scheduled treatment time where I waited in the lobby for over 45 minutes past my appointment time before I was called back.  I waited in the exam room for an hour without the doctor coming in to see me before I walked out without receiving my scheduled treatment.  No one from the office called to ask any questions as to why I left and still haven't.  I know laws with some  medications this clinic prescribes have changed recently but it doesn't seem they are concerned with any sort of customer service regarding their patients.  I understand why there are laws regarding timing of scripts but I don't understand why they aren't able to figure out a better system for refilling them in a timely manner that is compliant with laws.  Also, I know they could purchase software to help their process which could almost eliminate handwritten refill scripts or the need for patients to make a monthly trip there just to pick up the script but they haven't agreed to purchase it.  I don't believe it would take too long for them to recoup the $100k it costs for this program.  There is NO reason we shouldn't be able to expect them to complete a refill request within 24 to 48 hours but I've had times where it took over TEN business days!  Then, I'm told I should do a better job of remembering when to request my refill to get it on time and I generally request it over a week out.  Absolutely awful!!  I'm in the process of looking for a different clinic and hope I won't have to deal with this place again!|This department at the Iowa Clinic is so frustrating to deal with. The staff that greets you are lovely. And Dr Gates is, I think, doing the best she can, but she's the only doctor there. I had to literally badger them to get MRI results that were a week old. I called on Friday and was told someone would call me. No one did. I called on Monday at 10AM and the staffer said she would put the request in and mark it urgent. I waited until 4:00, knowing they close at 4:30, and was told she would send the request again marked ""urgent"". I called a third time at 4:29 and she said she would request that someone call me tomorrow. I was SO frustrated, didn't use bad language but voiced my frustration. A little before 5:00 the doctor finally called me. This department is giving Iowa Clinic a bad name. I haven't had issues with other departments there, but Pain Management needs some attention.|I came here having moved from NC to St Charles Iowa. I am on medicine and of course it's mandatory to come every 90 days. While the visit was OK, I don't think that the tech or Dr are very compassionate people. May just be their personality. I am surely missing my NC Pain Clinic doctor. They cared for you no matter how long it took.|Let me start by saying that I LOVE TIC. I simply, HATE, LOATHE, AND DESPISE the pain clinic. My first appointment mlthey called my name, turns out 2 Randi/Randy. Apparently they didn't look at the chart to see that they wanted a male and I infact was a female or even in the current time, verify the last name. So I was taken back to see a doctor that had never seen my records and was confused as hell for the 20 minutes he spent with me. My 2nd appointment I saw the PA, and she acted as though it was my first ever visit to any TIC office, and switched me off my meds that were controlling pain to something different to try. I tried it didn't work. I wound up in the ER because my pain was excruciating. I call to get in to go back on my old med was told I couldn't get in for over a month! After yelling, I was suddenly able to been seen after a long and miserable 2 weeks for a steroid injection (mind you I told yhem on the phone that I was given oral steroids but they said to come in it wouldn't be a problem). I go in and paid my $75 co-pay to be told that no, they can't do the injection to come back in another 2 weeks. Injection was fine, but the doctoe that actually oreformed the procedure is rude and acted like I should tell him how wonderful he was for just seeing me at all. He also told me that I don't need the medications or PT if I would simply do easy at home stretches every day like he does. He actually told me that PT is just a way for the clinic to make money off of people who are willing to do anything due to pain. I go in for another appoitment to follow-up after my injection and again was treated as though I was a new patient. I asked to be put back on the medication I was on when I previously was taking that had completely managed my pain and was tokd to simply take more of the current medication.
This is my third month dealing with this clinic and I'm done! I called in my Rx the required 10 days ahead of time and mysteriously that request wasn't sent back. They mark it as urgent because I'm overdue for my medication now and while they got it for me, they couldn't call to let me know it was ready or give me an estimated time on when to call back, was simply told to call back later in the day. I was in pain and it was getting worse by the minute, broke down and asked them to havea nurse call me to let me know if I should go to the ER or if they wanted me to tey something different. When I called back 3 hours later for the Rx, I still hadn't heard from a nurse. I blew up. I couldn't walk down a 10 foot hallway without crying and stopping to take a break. I needed to know if they had any kind of fix before forking out the $300 co-pay for an ER visit. I again stated my problems to the woman on the phone while crying in pain and magically a nurse WAS available to take my call and it wouldn't take the 24 hours previously stated to get a call back. I was told to go to the ER. Which leads me to today. Obviously, I need to get in to see the PA, but when I called before closing I was put into a call queue and held for roughly 10 minutes before 4:30 arrived and it dumped my call into some voicemail system that I was unable to leave a message with instead of the people on staff clearing the queue before leaving. To say the least my review would be to stay clear of this clinic. The staff is rude, uncaring, unprofessional, and just plain awful. I will be going in to see my amazingly wonderful family practitioner at TIC on Monday to get a referral to literally any pain specialist that isn't with TIC. Sadly, with the organization being capable of employing staff as awful as what they do in their pain clinic, I'm seriously considering finding a different clinic for all of my needs. I'm disappointed to say the least. If you're ever revered to this office, run away and find someone else. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS SUPPOSED PAIN SPECIALIST CLINIC. All they will do is take your money, cause you mental and physical pain above and beyond what you already have from whatever chronic ailments send you here.|Pretty sure the rating and the comments speak for themselves, if you want a 2 star ""woke"" doctor that does nothing for you hit this place up lol!

Very thorough and is a great listener. All of the rest of the staff from the nurses to the front desk staff are all kind and helpful. I have recommended the group to my friends and family and I also highly recommend them to anyone else who is suffering in pain and wants to be heard, taken seriously, and wants to see results!!|Could not say better things about this clinic. I moved to Cedar Rapids from Des Moines this past summer, and have continued to make that drive to see Dr. Szczepanek and his team because of their speed and quality of service. In CR, I have to wait 3-4 months to get seen just for a consultation for service at any other clinic. At Central States? They offered me a next day appointment! I have done injections both with anesthesia and without, and each time Dr. Szczepanek made me feel 100% comfortable with the procedures. I also appreciate how real he is with me - my first consultation he told me I would probably need surgery, but he would do the best he could. One year later, I'm scheduling surgery, but the multiple injections I've gotten have helped me make it through this year without being entirely bedridden. Thank you, Central States, for your amazing care team and attention to my pain! I never once felt like my pain was ignored or minimized. I cannot recommend this clinic enough!|I have been a patient with this clinic for many years. The staff is amazing and always take care of my needs. I would highly recommend them to anyone suffering from chronic pain. Christy Haack is awesome. She definitely is in tune with my pain, and does everything she can to make my pain bearable. Overall, this clinic is top notch, and I would definitely recommend them.|I was diagnosed with multiple herniated discs, so I had to come here for an intra spinal injection for pain relief. The scheduling was easy and there was barely any wait time. The doctor listened to and addressed my concerns. The building is clean & my procedure went smoothly. I'm extremely grateful for the care I received & I will be returning for a follow up and future injections as necessary.|Very negative experience, my husband was getting an injection, I heard him holler in pain from the next room, I got concerned so I went to stand in front of the door of his procedure room, and I heard the doctor say to my husband, if you don't stop your bullshit this will be your last visit. When my husband came in the original waiting room with me to tell me what he heard the doctor say, the nurse came in the room and stood behind him and said that is inappropriate, the conversation was between my husband and I and of course he got a bit agitated. We ended up leaving very confused.|I had another appt.  at Central States Pain Clinic last week.   Again my experience was positive.   Not because my pain was completely relieved, rather, because I was heard, my concerns were taken seriously and I was offered options beyond acetaminophen.
I am so grateful for the team of Caring health care providers at this office.|This clinic is the real deal. They include you in the med planning.

The new Riverhills center is very nice. Everyone there was kind and attentive. Dr. Rayburn described the procedure and asked if I had any questions. It went quickly and I am looking forward to the pain relief.|I liked Dr Rayburn. He had reviewed my MRI, X-rays and other doctors' documentation.  He was ready for my appointment. He was very thorough and evaluated what I needed and what he needed to do. He was very positive and confident. His demeanor exuded a high level of caring and compassion. He emphasized the need to concentrate on relief in the first hours after the epidural as well as the long term relief providing feedback for future treatment.|Dr. Rayburn, aside from procedures, has never spent more than a few minutes speaking to me. He definitely failed to warn me of one potential downside to nerve ablation, which resulted in significant pain increase after right side. Although I contacted his office a few days after with concerns, his nurse called in meds I already take and offered ibuprofen, which conflicts with a medication I take. My medication is well documented in their files, including time of last dose by med prior to first ablation.
Today, I left without doing the left side ablation. He indicated my pain increase only happens about 1% of the time, but it could happen again with the left side- and this pain can last for 3 weeks?! In addition to the pain I have, this would cause me to need possibly 3 weeks off work unplanned. He was rushed, and seemed more concerned with getting to the next patient and said he would do the next in line while I thought about it. It felt like he had an assembly line of patients...
I dressed and left immediately. The pain had me literally crawling at home at points over the last week. This should have been discussed up front, at proactively offered to be rescheduled when I called to report pain I was NOT told could happen.
Now I will be seeking a second opinion with DMOS, and this caused a likely significant delay in my care.|I think Dr Rayburn is an excellent doctor he's got an excellent bedside manner and I really like him o|De Rayburn is the most compassionate Dr I have seen so far regarding my back pain! I have had several pain injections and yesterday I had a Radio frequency ablation on my Thoracic spine. Though the sedation they used didn't work well for me, I am very hopeful that this procedure will give me relief. If it works I would love for him to do my lumbar area- I have had very severe pain for several years. I am seeing Dr Rayburn as my only hope for less pain and a better level of living life! I highly recommend him and his staff is amazingly kind and helpful! Big thumbs up Dr Rayburn!!!|The cortisone in my left hip helps but I need a few days off work for the agony from the injections to go away but he won't give me a work excuse for any time off. I can't even get out of bed to use the bathroom but I'm expected to go to work. If it weren't for the relief I got from the bursa injection last time I wouldn't go through the pain but he hits the right spot and his staff a very kind. I just need 2 days off work after the procedure. Otherwise I'd give 5 star. Pluss I need something to bite down on to help the pain from the extremely painful procedure.|I have been to numerous Doctors for the extreme pain in my back and Dr.Rayburn has given me the most relief.  When he did shots in my back to help take away the pain, I did not even feel the needles, he was that smooth and concerned about my pain.  I would most highly recommend him to anyone.|Dr. Rayburn and the Staff at Iowa Ortho have been a Godsend for me!
Had hip injection elsewhere and suffered horrifically during and after procedure.
Have had two injections now from Dr. Rayburn and I can tell you the man knows what he's about.
While not a completely painless process he does it with competence and skillful care so as to make you as comfortable as possible.
Would recommend him to anyone needing an injection.

I went with my husband to his appointment that he was referred to and we were literally told I'm not sure why you're even here by Dr. Smith. My husband has chronic shoulder pain that he has been dealing with for years. Capital Orthopaedics said they would do surgery but unfortunately my husband can't have it till 2025 due to work issues. That being said Capital referred him to this clinic for pain management in the meantime. He asked for tramadol until he can have his surgery to manage the pain and she said no she would not help with that and referred us back to Capital. Waste of time and money. I would not be seen at this clinic as they are rude and not helpful at all. I put 1 star as I had no choice so I can post this. Zero stars all around.|I have been rejected TWICE by this clinic saying my chronic pelvic pain caused by stage FOUR Endometriosis doesn't qualify to be treated. I have had 6 surgeries, one of them was FIFTEEN hours long, and i still am in chronic daily pain. So much pain that when i go to the ER and get Fentanyl that doesn't even take away the pain. This is my daily life. How dare you reject my case saying I am not in chronic pain. Your website specifically says you treat pelvic pain. You should be ashamed of yourselves.|I've been dealing severe back pain for years and when my doctor referred me to pain specialist. I had an MRI in 2022 that showed the issue with my back. I had 3 injections and they didn't last over a month at most, plus I couldn't move for a couple days after getting the injections. Had 2 nerve blocks and then the nerve ablations, I couldn't hardly move for almost a week after that ordeal. I guess I was charged an outrageous co-pay at Westlake Surgery Center, in the same building and affiliated with Pain Specialist, and we live on SS and SSD and was stunned when I got the bill for my co-pay. I didn't have the extra money then and I don't have it now. My back pain has gotten significantly worse, usually have to roll out of bed, can't stand for long at all, feels like I have boiling water flowing from my back to my feet and sometimes clear to my toes, and it's now on the point of being unbearable. Now sometimes I can be walking and every once in a while one leg or the other won't get the message to move. Needless to say I've fallen flat on my face a several times. Now I get muscle cramps any time I try to do anything and quite often when it's one of those days that I can't hardly move. The days I can't hardly move and then I get the. Muscle cramps so intense it's unbearable because I can't get up and move around. I can't remember how many times I've been to pt and had x-rays. Like I said, I had an MRI 2 years ago, I used to be 5'10"" but now I'm just over 5'6."" So I went back to the pain center and she had NO EMPATHY. I had done some research and talked to 3 other people about my issues in my back and the severe muscle cramps, sometimes in my chest, and every one of them said that I needed to get off the gabapentin asap. They said that they take the same exact medications as I do and the gabapentin is the culprit for the cramping. But she said that I would have to jump thru all the hoops, x-rays, pt,and then another MRI, that we can't afford. The 3 other people I talked to said that their doctor weaned them off the gabapentin and prescribed them hydrocodone, one in the morning and one at night. They said that they were able to get thru the day with their chores and be able to tolerate them and one just before bedtime and was getting a full nights sleep. She said that she wouldn't help me out with a med change unless I jumped thru all her hoops again that I can't afford, and blah blah blah. So I just wasted $40 co-pay to see her in Pain Specialists and basically told to go kick rocks. I don't think she would give a damn if I had a broken leg or arm or neck because she don't give a damn about my back pain or the muscle cramps.  The cramps I get in my chest feels like I'm having a heart attack and she didn't give a damn about that either. Last I knew the heart is a muscle as well as the pectoral muscles in the chest. But guess what, she didn't give a damn about that either so I walked out and made sure everyone heard what what I had to say about the treatment I received.|Went there hysterical crying from pain and left crying even harder when they told me they wouldn't help me unless I did physical therapy so I could get an MRI. I can't do that as I'm practically bed ridden from pain with nothing to manage it. I hate how horrible our healthcare system has become. How can you send someone out of your office in tears like that? It's inhumane. What I'm being put through is inhumane. Dogs get better treatment. I haven't showered in over 2 weeks, I'm hardly eating, I haven't slept in days because of this pain and no one seems to care. If I could give 0 stars I would.|Dr. Jolene Smith, the nurses, the office staff are all helpful and caring.  Dr. Smith is a ""miracle worker"" in my book.  She has relieved me of severe pain thus increasing mobility.  I plan to get back to physical fitness!!|Dr Moyse is one of the most honest, compassionate and caring doctors I've seen in my 2 year pain journey with cervical osteoarthritis and two cervical bulging discs. He always takes time to explain things, and from our very first visit, he refused to schedule me for injections until I first met with a surgeon to weigh ALL of my options, so i could make an informed decision. I do know that ESI's bring in nice profit for doctors, so i really really appreciated that he did not push it on me until i was certain this was the best care plan for me.
And, when i was in severe pain and explained why I do not want to go down the opioid path, (he defintely did not attempt to push those on me, but offered it as a one time solution to help me sleep while i waited for my injection) he prescribed a muscle relaxer that allowed me to get comfortable enough to sleep at night. The comfort i received from the medicine and my injections has given me back so much of the quality of life i had lost and i truly have no words for how grateful I am for this!
I have been through the ringer of being bounced back and forth from chiropractors to doctors to physical therapists to orthos and was beginning to lose hope. I never thought Id be writing a review raving about medical care, but here we are ;-) I have faith that I may very well be on my way towards healing without surgery!
The whole staff here is also very friendly and kind!|Dr Allen Eckhoff & his team have worked with me over the past year to help me with my chronic back pain. Each visit they take their time and really listen to me. Even when I have felt emotional, they're so understanding & help me feel not so alone in all of this. I appreciate them so much :)|I went there as I have been having back pain for my hr last 2 1/2 years. I have been told I have a disc bulge spinal stenosis, I have been told to get si joint injections, pirformis syndrome injections, I have done chiropractic, I have done pt. Nothing has helped I am beyond frustrated! The whoever she was talking to me after the nurse saw me she talked to me like I was an idiot as I needed her to explain in in non medical terms what a discharge budge is and spinal stenosis means. She answered and she has the audacity to tell me I don't know what else you are looking for here. I said to be able to figure out why I am in so much pain. She said well your symptoms don't match up with your symptoms. I'm line okay your point? She's like well you don't want to try injections anymore. I said no why would I they have Not helped before why would they know. She's like well I suppose I can give you a referral to a surgeon. I'm like okay well then. Like rude. I am in pain I have been in for 2 years and you're the one asking me what I want them to do for me? Seriously. She had zero empathy. I have no idea who she was. She was not even the doctor who gave me the priformis syndrome shots. She acted like it was case closed or do more shots. Screw this place the office at the front desk girls are never very friendly. I would NNEVER recommend this place! Ever! A waste of my time insurance money and my time to get asked what do you want me to do for you then? Learn empathy hire a friendlier staff make your doctors feel like they are heard and you want to help them come up with a plan instead of being rude and dismissive.

I'm in excruciating pain almost everyday. My regular doctor pushed for them to get me in just for them to basically tell just keep moving and the pain will get better. This is not my first rode. No the pain isn't going to get better. It's been like this and getting worse since age 16. I have tried all physically therapy, chiropractor and other treatments all of which have failed or made my situation worse. I do not feel heard by these doctors at all. And I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do. This is what sends ppl over then edge and I'm teetering right there about to fall with no compassion or care in the world shown. I don't recommend going here.|I went a while back and spoke to 3 different people about my pain. Two of the individuals were working with my pain specialist and the third I spoke to was the specialist. None of them heard me nor did they acknowledge what I was talking about. They did however draw their own conclusions and focused on one diagnosis that had absolutely nothing to do with the reason I was being seen. I left in tears. I was completely frustrated and disgusted beyond words.Worst experience I have ever had and I refuse to return. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.|I am unfortunately writing a review for the Pain Management Clinic. I would not recommend coming here. When I expressed that I was terrified of getting injections I was not met with compassion and the doctor there looked at me like she could not believe what I said. Her reactions were so noticeable to me that it was to the point where I responded with ""Am I the only person that has expressed being afraid of this procedure?"" The doctor nodded her head indicating a yes. I went to Patient Experience and it took them well over 10 business days to respond with ""I am sorry you are not satisfied."" Wouldn't anyone be if they were treated like that? Not to mention the doctor expressed she was not comfortable performing the procedure and I was denied seeing anyone else. This delayed my diagnostic testing from my surgical consult. I saw this doctor once, which was enough, so obviously I was not doctor shopping. Don't worry UIHC I went to another hospital Interventional Pain Management Clinic in Cedar Rapids. Check out my review there. They were fabulous and took my worries seriously. There bedside manner was outstanding and I got through the procedure just fine. I would suggest doing some training at that hospital and learn how to treat patients. I would like to add that there instructions were confusing. At first they told me no antianxiety meds and then they said it was alright. They did not like my confusion and my questions about this and a nurse did not even return my call. Also the clinic I went to in Cedar Rapids stated they could only do one side at a time because it was too dangerous to do both sides of intercostal nerve blocks as there is an increased risk for complications. Do NOT go to this clinic. Go to Cedar Rapids.|I used to have confidence going to the pain clinic. And felt like I was being heard. After the last time, no.
When I talked about the pain I was having at the time the doctor's response was something like "" oh now you have a new pain "".
I was just being honest. I can't help it. That's where I was hurting.
When you have 1 whole side of your body hurting, I would think they would be more sympathetic.
Do they know what it's like to not get sleep when you lay down. Because the pain in your shoulder wakes you up. Try sleeping in a chair.  And then go to work. It's rough.
Maybe someday you doctors will be in pain and see what it's like.
Karma.
I can no longer recommend the pain clinic .

Dr. A. is very professional and knowledgeable, as are the staff, and incredibly helpful, and very thorough about explaining everything. I never felt rushed as I struggle to walk and go a lot slower than I used to walk. I wish there was some medicine to help get the edge off when the pain is absolutely excruciating, and I wish there was some miracle cure. But I was informed that the shots don't always help prior to getting them, and that the body heals in time. Dr. A. told me that I had 4 mildly to moderately bulging disks in my low back and possibly some torn muscles as well. He recommended that I continue with physical therapy for at least another month, of which doing the physical therapy exercises are slowly helping. I never expected to ever be in this much pain and limited range of motion for so long, but the care I have received throughout all of this at the Pain Clinic, at Occupational Health and at Physical Therapy, has been top notch. Well done to all for all of your outstanding and professional work. Thank you so much.  Have a safe, splendid and blessed Memorial weekend, and may God's grace, mercy, and peace in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be with you all, always. Amen.|This is the worst run pain clinic ever. I asked a few questions and was told to get out by the woman in charge because she couldn't answery questions. She was a very small and spiteful person, she came out looking for a fight and when I just sat there and asked questions she couldn't handle it. She should not be in charge of anything.|Very happy with the first meeting with Dr A. The sweets nurse checked me in. Dr A Had my MRI's up for me to look at.  Dr A showed me where the pain was coming.  Dr A felt I should wait before having any injections. I set up for a return visit. At my return visit, I was still in pain but getting better. The nurse who checked me in was very impatient. Dr A came in I felt rushed and he was not wanting to hear anything from me.  A totally different atmosphere from the first meeting. He did offer to refer me to someone else. After thinking about it I did contact Dr A and said yes I would like a referral since I still had pain! He stated he had nothing more to offer go to my family Dr.   I am very grateful to Dr A for pointing out one of the area's the pain was coming from.  Knowing where your pain is coming from is HUGE!  I had more questions since I still was having pain but I could tell he did not want to hear it.  Today I received a letter from Dr A telling me he would no longer be my Dr. I had no intention of seeing him again. So to have Dr A send me a letter telling me he would not see me anymore? I am not sure what the point was for sending the letter.|So very frustrated with this office. First appointment I showed up at the given time and was told they gave me the wrong date and no doctor was available. 2nd appointment the doctor decided a hip MRI was necessary and didn't do anything for my pain. 3rd visit I showed up and they didn't have the written report from my hip MRI. I was sent home until they received it. I called 2 more times and finally called the office where I got the MRI myself and had it faxed to them. I made a call to see if they got it and was told they would be referring me to a surgeon as the doctor didn't feel he could do anything for me. I now have received 2 bills for the same date with 2 different account numbers and literally they never treated me for anything. I called them and the very curt secretary gave me the UnityPoint general billing department. I requested a detailed bill 2 weeks ago which I never received. I called the office again 2 days ago and requested to talk with the person in the office who does the billing and still waiting for a return call. Terrible experience and now trying to figure out my next step for the fraudulent billing!!!|If your primary care physician tries to refer you here tell them no you want to go somewhere else. I went Friday the 6th of October for bulging of discs in my back because I have been in pain for two years now and Dr Afzal acknowledged yeah you have bulging then shrugged it off, I have brought up I also had knee issues that I have been taking Physical therapy for. He then said I don't have that much cartilage left in my knee. I said okay, thinking can I get something for my pain because that's the whole reason I am here? He goes straight to my weight and because I am ""too fat"". He tried pushing weight loss surgery on me multiple times going around the subject why I was even there. I walked out in the same amount of pain as I walked in with. Don't go here for actual help he won't give you anything he'll comment on your weight and tell you to lose it but instructs you not to walk or be on it for a period of time... He upset my husband with talking down to me like I was uneducated person, the only reason they get ONE star is because the nurses were amazing, sweet, and caring.|KIND STAFF only!

I would not trust ANY surgeon here in the W'loo/CF area PERIOD! I swear someone poisoned the water here when I left to CO for 11 years.

Not sure about Afzal, yet the other Dr, wrote in MY records I toe/heel walked for him, not true, I denied back surgery (told him my L4-L5 is fused) . Now I refuse to let any ""Dr"" around here do ANYTHING invasive. Just like the drug slogan: Just Say No!|Dr. Afzal was extremely professional when I saw him 2018 for lower back pain. He gave me an injection to relieve the swelling and pain. It worked great for me. Pain returned late in 2020 . Dr. Afzal looked at my MRI and told me it didn't look good. Told me I could try the injection again . He said it might help, but thought I needed to see a surgeon. Sent my paperwork on to surgeon. Thank you.|Dr afzal is amazing. I was having trouble with my lower back. He seen me the same day I called. Did some test. And he called me twice to make sure everything was doing well. Wanted to see me before he went on vacation. I love the fact that he cares about his patients",2024-05-24|2025-01-31|2024-03-22|2023-12-06|2023-10-08|2023-12-06|2020-11-10|2022-12-22,5|1|3|1|1|1|5|5,,,"1 p.m.|12 p.m.|2 p.m.",51.2|45|44.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJs2FsIsFT5YcRPW1PGn5aQfA,19

They aren't interested in helping with your pain and will invalidate everything you say to them. The receptionist mocked me when I asked to speak to a supervisor and was refusing to do so until I persisted.

The last nurse I saw there named Karen, put on a blood pressure cuff upside down, after it errored 2 times I finally mentioned it to her and she fixed it. Then the machine wasn't working, she took it off and then it popped up numbers that she wrote down. Instead of using the manual cuff that was hanging on the wall.  She was confused on how to document what I was describing as far as pain and said out loud that she wasn't going to mention the knee pain. The computer she was using died within minutes and she was gone for 5 or more minutes to find a cord. Basically the worse nurse I've experienced in a clinic, had she been new I would have understood. But she was not.

I have been subjected to over 12 shots in 3 different body parts, tried every OTC option and every prescribed medication and nothing has helped. I have done everything Dr. Ransdell recommended with no pain relief at all.

When I finally asked for further help with my continuing high level of pain he told me to go see my primary care doctor.

He clearly is not in the right profession and doesn't understand anything about chronic pain. He should simply go back to being an anesthesiologist and leave the pain management to doctors who truly care.|Dr.Quam is the most calm, caring, professional/doctor I have ever had.

He's been doing my steroid epidurals for about a year now and I'm very pleased.  The nurses there are also so sweet too- Especially Cortney!!|Contrary to what Miss ( Gravincas ) says because so far, any of the 4 reviews she has given have been negative. This place has been very helpful and understanding. They listened to my wife about what is going on with her and had a positive discussion about treatments and things to help manage her pain when the other doctors she had seen just blew her off. People need to realize that help and treatment is a joint effort between patient and care professional|Excellent staff and care. Was transferred from UofI after another back fusion. 2yrs ago I was transferred to Mercy Hospital for physical therapy after my first disc fusion. While the staff were very nice and helpful, the therapy however was very limited and lacking physical excursion. However this time I was transferred to St Luke's thankfully. Everything and everyone in the unit was very helpful, knowledgeable and understanding. The therapy room was very extensive and accommodating. They have a piece of equipment for every need you will have. Very laidback and happy atmosphere. I will only go back to them after future surgery's. Highly recommended|I had cervical epidural on 7/22/20. I was very scared and nervous.  The nurse and training nurse made me feel so relaxed and comfortable.  The Dr. Explained everything and I was in and out very efficiently.  They allowed me to wake up fully before sending me home. I slept most of the day. Although the meds they used are wearing off now, I can feel the difference already. Outside of the soreness of the shot. I feel okay right now.|I walked In and was instantly greeted . Dr. Saddler is very nice and wants to get my pain under control. She is very knowledgeable. All the nurses are great! I appreciate all of the staff
.|They diagnosed me with cervical dystonia and said Botox was a treatment for it. It needed prior authorization and it would take awhile. So, my next appointment a month later I thought thats what would be happening. It wasn't. I saw a Dr Matthews that time and he honestly made me a little uncomfortable with how he called me pet names and was just creepy. Literally nothing happened at that appointment. I asked about the botox and he laughed and said it takes forever to get approved. Come to my appointment today 2 months later and asked about the botox and Dr Driscoll (who I saw the first time) and was told no orders were ever put in for it  to be authorized for my insurance. What? She's the one who told me that was what she wanted to try, AND Dr Matthews made it seem like it was still processing at the insurance company. I've wasted 3 months of my time thinking something was going to happen to relieve my pain, instead I've just given them money for nothing. Not going back.

Edit: as I was leaving the nurse asked if I wanted to put the request in for Botox. Hesitant at first, she said you don't have to do it (I made it known I wasn't seeing them again) but just so you know if you do go somewhere else. 2 DAYS LATER I got confirmation it was approved. 2 days.

The lab tech came out to take blood from her but because the woman sat in her wheel chair backwards curled in a ball as she dry heeves, she just shrugged and left.  One of the other waiting patients expressed loudly to no one in particular that she probably went to the back and said she was noncompliant when she did not even talk to her.  I called|I have not had a good experience. Wait times are extreme. Did not feel heard.|If this is the direction all hospitals are going then there's no hope for the humanization of medical care
Unlike my previous stay nursing staff was great. My earlier stay was in the peak of Covid and night staff was neglectful,incompetent, and obviously stand ins.

It took me making it clear in no uncertain terms that I had at least a working knowledge of patients rights to end up being able to stay another day.
As a 65 yr old woman who's blood pressure went a bit wacky during surgery it was inexcusable to try to give me or anyone else the bums rush. Again, I can't say enough about the nursing care I received but here was another case of putting profits above people
You have PATIENTS RIGHTS, ALWAYS ASK FOR A PATIENTS ADVOCATE|I give five stars to the staff,  the nurses are great.   I liked two of the providers (I say providers because they are not doctors) I saw each one once - they  both had great bedside manners and were caring.  I had hip injections by one and I barely felt them.  The provider I saw the majority of  my visits over 18 months I didn't care for.  I felt he was condescending and that's not the type of provider I want to see for pain management,.  I didn't have a choice he was the only provider they would schedule me with.  Being new to the area there aren't many options so I've been driving to Chicago for my epidurals.|I have never met a more unprofessional staff in my life.  The doctor has no clue how Wful his staff is with patients. First they couldn't find my records. Then one nurse refused to have a Medtronic Representative attend my meeting. The doctor said the Medtronic Representative was welcome to come in the room. The Representative had crucial information about my case to share. A week later I  get a call from the office staff asking for my Medicare number. She said I  couldn't have my operation until Medicare approved it so it could be November before I  can maybe have my surgery
Why didn't they handle this on Se623rdinstead of calling me on September 29th and asking for my Medicare number. I have had so much back pain for several years and this  mess has prolonged the time for me to get help. I will never go back. I've never seen such incompetence.|It isn't their fault. The government has doctors under their thumb not to prescribe real pain meds.  Prescribing psyche meds for pain is reckless and dangerous. Most chronic pain sufferers already wish they were dead adding psychemads to the mix is just asking for trouble.|This was by far the most unprofessional experience I've had with Unity point. Not all departments are like this. The pain management and Dr. Kari was unprofessional in his approach at helping patients. I understand Dr. get busy. But to provide a statements about working long and not wanting to be there is frightening for patients. If you schedule to take off work a certain time, that's the time you plan to get treated. I wouldn't recommend Dr. Maruti Kari|Horrible staff here. Never return phone calls. Don't submit paperwork to insurance properly. Rude in person and when you do scripture get a call back, which only happens when you call the Patient Advocate and compliance about the lack of return calls.

Before you ever get in the door they will try and make you sign a document saying they will charge you for a missed appointment. I refused to sign it saying there is no disclaimer for inclement weather (IOWA ice and snow storms) nor illness. That was a HUGE ordeal, but I did get in. They are not interested in you as a person in pain, only in taking as much money from you as possible without giving you any insight into your condition or what you REALLY need to FEEL or GET better! I was even told at one point that the doctors do not speak to patients directly! You have to go through their assistants. WOW!!! Less than 30 days after being seen for a back problem. They said I'd need to have a nerve ablation test done. Well, really two, because insurance won't pay for the surgery unless you have two. So the first one didn't help me at all so I came in again to tell them that and I said I don't think I want to do the second one. They talked me into it, saying they were here and ready to do it and you never know it, might work! What a lie. It was less effective than the first test! I wanted to talk to them about my hip pain as well, but I'd have to make another appointment for that! Geez, REALLY? When I got the hip appointment, I called to make sure they got the MRI I'd had taken from Lutheran. Told them to call and get it. A month later, they had no idea I'd even had an MRI! I talked to them about my back pain and not once did they say I'd need to have that done before I could have back surgery, which I found out later by the surgeon's PA. So I tried to get it scheduled and they wanted me to come back in for a re-assessment before deciding to give me the doctor ordered Epidural, so ANOTHER OFFICE CALL and PAYMENT that was completely unnecessary! And then to get rescheduled it was going to be 2 full months! Ridiculous!|Never again! She never listened or helped me for my pain. I have back problems and it's extremely painful to live with everyday and I have MRI proof something is wrong still no help! She had to have her nurse practitioner tell me that they couldn't help. She couldn't even face me herself! Sad! I'm very displeased with all that has happened. Never again!|Dr. Smith has been helping to manage my health care for several years.
