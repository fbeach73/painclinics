I came back to Dr Stottle because he and Stacie listen while I figure things out and explain things in detail.|I've been with Dr. Stottle since he took over the practice from Dr Skiba. So it has been like 8 years. I've always been treated with respect even sometimes when I maybe didn't deserve it. Kylie is absolutely a dream. Her goal is to make sure you don't get stuck paying for something you thought was covered. If you ever get stuck paying for a surgery that you were told was covered and it wasn't, it isn't cheap. You will be grateful for her doing her job. Dr. Stottle knows what he is doing. I seen 9 other pain doctors and I've been with him the longest. Very good people.@|I've been seeing Dr. Stottle and his team for going on 7 years for my back. I've had nothing but the best care from them.

If I'm not having procedures done, I see Dr. Lee. I can't say enough great things about this woman! For one, besides the help I get from Dr. Stottle, I am with this clinic because of her! She is beyond kind, understands what I'm going through, doesn't recommend something if she doesn't think it will help, and my favorite part about her, I feel truly cared for. Thank you, Dr. Lee. You have a special spot in my heart, and I'm truly grateful for all that you continue to do to help with my chronic pain.

I love the staff as well. I love when I go in, they take time to chat with me. They make sure my meds and treatments are going well and get to know me personally.

To sum it all up, I feel like I'm part of their family EVERY TIME I go in there.

I should also state that my Mom comes from Sioux Falls, SD to see Dr. Stottle and Lee too! I love seeing the immediate relief on her face once we leave.

Thank you again, I'm forever grateful that I am in such good hands with all of you!|I cannot say enough positive about Dr. Stottle!!! Gratefully, I was referred to him by my surgeon. Dr. Stottle was not going to stop until he found pain relief for me! After living with chronic pain since 2014, and enduring five back surgeries, he found me pain relief!!! Dr. has a wonderful bedside manner. He is a kind soul who genuinely cares for his patients. I highly recommend him without reserve. He has given me back my life.|So grateful for this wonderful group of healthcare professionals!! During my visit Dani greeted me cheerfully and listened to all of my concerns! Dr. Stottle took the time to discuss my options for the day of my appointment and for the future to help with my pain. I know this office sees so many patients and helps so many people- and it's not everyday you find a provider that takes time to listen and explain and doesn't seemed rushed out the door. I trust and value their expertise and have even referred people their way because they are so great! Thank you Omaha Pain!|Have been going to see Dr Stottle for awhile now. Have had terrible back pain. Had gone and seen alot of orthopedic docs and was not getting anywhere. Dr Stottle tried some pain management options. Wasn't getting much relief but I felt positive we were going  in the right direction. Upon a follow-up visit from a procedure I stated it hadn't helped much, in fact the last week or so the pain was much worse. The physician assistant asked if I wanted any pain meds. I said that would be great. In the past I had refused any prescriptions for narcotics. They were going to send in a predetermination for a different procedure to my insurance company. I waited for a few weeks and hadn't heard from them so I called and left a message for the nurse. No call back from her, so I called again, and again, and again. Nobody has called me back!! It seems they want to help you as long as you don't ask for pain meds. If you do they cut you loose without a word as much from them. Extremely poor business practice and they don't seem to really care about there patients well being. I have referred 2 friends to them and they are currently seeing him for their pain management. I hope he treats them better than he has treated me. I would now not recommend his office to anyone else.|I travel 60 miles or so to see Dr. Stottle. I was referred by my neurologist. The two work together to try and help me with all my issues. He and his staff have always been attentive, helpful and kind. They help me to feel relaxed while I am hurting and trying to explains things to them; and he, his nurses and  PAs have not only listened to me, but take the time to answer all my questions; and one thing I love is that they EXPLAIN so that I can understand procedures, medicines, etc. I appreciate all of them and am so thankful to have such a great doctor in our area. I have referred many to them and will continue to do so.|The BEST pain Control Doctor in Omaha!  I have seen three other pain control doctors in Omaha and they neither have the bedside demeanor nor skill of Dr Stottle.  Now he won't let you get away with BSing him or his staff and certainly won't let you violate your pain / prescription agreement!  However, if you are in pain, he will do everything in his power to see you and get you out of pain.  Yes, sometimes he is tied to insurance and pre-approvals, but when I have been at a level 10 pain, he has seen me in the same day and though perhaps I have had to agree to pay his cash price, knowing I can spread the cost of the treatment out over a few months.  At least he saw me the same day and treated me!  Other pain control docs in Omaha won't even see you until the insurance company agrees to pay for the treatment period!  Doctor Stottle's Staff are all extremely caring: from the front desk girls, to the intake nurses, to the injection assistants to the PAs.  I have never encountered a staff member who was not compassionate and willing to bend over backwards to assist a patient!

The other phenomenal thing about Doctor Stottle is he doesn't overschedule patients!  Even when the waiting room is full, I have only waited more than 15 minutes ONCE!  And then I was given a Starbucks gift card to compensate me for my inconvenience!

Absolutely the best Pain Control Doctor in Omaha and possibly in the Midwest!",2025-02-12|2024-05-11|2024-03-05|2023-12-15|2023-06-24|2023-10-05|2023-08-30|2021-07-21,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What's address of clinic on Giles road please ty seeing doctor stroddle Friday","Omaha Pain Physicians La Vista 12702 Westport Pkwy SUITE 101, La Vista, NE 68138, USA",emergency_appointments|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ6fzLh-WMk4cRmUvDPb9iLII,33

Been ""working"" with Mr. Balter at midwest pain clinic for over a year. Still in the same if not worse pain then before I seen him. Push towards surgery rather then alternative pain relief. Staff and Mr. Balter do not return calls and do not care for their patients. It's all about the profit. I would not recommend him or the clinic to my worst enemy.|ZERO STARS, NOT one star, ZERO. Dr. Balter has the absolute worst care practice and is extremely dismissive and disrespectful to patients. He does not care about patients individually and treats everyone the same while priding himself on it. He makes patients wait up to an hour for scheduled appointments although he will refuse to see a patient if they are 3 minutes late. He does what he wants despite patient refusal or requests, such as radio frequency nerve preparation under the guise of a steroid injection. Beyond horrible to multiple staff and nurses with no decency to those who rely on him as a doctor or supervisor. While under pressure and patient inquiry he can become extremely irritable with the potential of emotional and mental abuse. Dr. Balter is not safe to be around and can display violent behavior that can be triggering or upsetting, especially for women. I would not recommend him whatsoever under any circumstances.|I had never been to a pain management clinic before, and I suspected I would just get pain pills. But Dr Balter and his PA spent so much time with me and were actually concerned with getting to the bottom of my pain, not just padding it with pills.  I was examined, and a diagnosis was suspected, and on my second visit, he actually did a procedure for me! I have been to so many doctors and it seems either no one really cares or no one really had any answers. Dr Balter really came through and he really cares. I am so glad I was referred to this clinic and that he is my doctor!  I have told so many people about my experience, and that they should go see him for their back pain too, thank God for Dr Balter!|I hav back issues. I have seen Dr Butler for
Many years. He is so good at what he does.|Amazing Dr and medical Staff. Everything is well explained, they truly care about your needs! This is the first time I have had a Dr and medical staff listen to my issues and actually make a difference. Dr Balter sets treatment per your needs and is super knowledgeable. Thanks for all of your help!|I trust Dr. Balter to treat any of my pain problems. I've been around the block seeing many pain docs and Dr Balter was the most thorough evaluating me. He was the most careful to explain to me so I understood and felt comfortable making decisions about procedures that could have risks. I felt listened to and that's important to me, especially if there are bumps along the way. We decided to go ahead with the sacroiliac procedure because I did not want to live the rest of my life in pain and taking narcotics or have more surgery. The procedure went well and I am reclaiming and enjoying life again. We had a few minor setbacks, but Dr. Balter carefully helped me get over them too. Dr Balter's the best and I am glad I trusted him to take care of me and share my experience with others in need of reclaiming their lives.|Do not go with Dr Balter at this office!!! You will wait for forever to be seen on time at your appt, if you have a procedure scheduled at a specific time be prepared to wait as well. I was prepared to have a procedure that I needed to be put under, he actually took a patient before me that had no appointment, and just walked right in! Nurses and I were pissed! Some of the nurses can't chart for anything!! Had a procedure and my injection sites we're leaking fluids, called several times. She didn't take it to Dr Balter immediately, Dr Balters bed side manner tends to suck sometimes.

Michael Perry knew exactly where the pain was located. In 15 minutes, I had no pain in my hip. He used natural Saline injections which had little to no pain.
I always assumed I'd eventually have to have a hip replacement. I now know that is not the case.
I cannot recommend PerryWork enough!
They are kind and expert in natural healing.|Had extreme pain in hip down leg from falling on tailbone down stairs and herniated discs. Haven't been handling the pain well for multiple weeks. Lack of sleep.  Overall crappy.  Got xray mri and then saw a professional

Thank you for your service it's amazing|Michael provides relief from pain related to inflammation within minutes. The science underlying his rationale and methodology is sound. He provides a service that would be pervasive at all medical facilities if profit weren't the primary objective in our nation's sickcare system.  A warm thanks to Michael and his team!|Attended with scapular pain after nearly 18 months of suffering with it. The treatment was literally one and done, that was over six months ago and haven't had even a single twinge since. Simply amazing.|There aren't enough words in the English language to thank Mike Perry & Elly for their help & healing! :-)

In 2016, I suffered a work-related low back injury and was told I needed surgery. To be specific, I had an L4/L5 double dissectomy and 2 bone spurs removed.  Ever since then, my quality of life has never been the same -- surgeon to surgeon, doctor to doctor, only to have pills shoved down my throat and no progress whatsoever.

I was referred to Mike Perry's office last month.  Mike has completely changed my life in three office visits.

Mike actually put his hands on me to actually feel what was actually going on in my low back.  Can you believe that? No other provider has done this in over a decade, not even in the emergency room.  And trust me, I've seen a lot of ""doctors"" and ""surgeons"" over the last 7 years.

Mike recognized and discovered the problem right away, and after three short office visits, I have my life back!!  And the best part -- I canceled my upcoming appointment in 2 weeks because I definitely do not need surgery.

Thank you Mike and Elly!!

I messed my back up 35 years ago and I was treated and felt great ever since.  But now that old age has caught up with me, my L5 has been causing me great pain and misery.  After two separate procedures I am feeling normal again.  I can't thank you and your staff enough.  I also appreciate the fact that Dr Soares didn't try to give me pain meds and push me out the door like other physicians I've seen recently. Dr Soares seems genuinely concerned about my health.
Thanks Dr!|I have been going to Dr Soares for sevrral.years.  I find him to be very caring. He has helped me tremendously.  I have never had a bad experience with him. There are two sides to every story. I have heard patients to speak terrible to him.  Just saying.|Very disappointed in this office. My mother has seen Dr. Soares for YEARS....and because she is a Medicare/Medicaid patient, she can't follow him to his new practice. So the Dr. who has 'absorbed' Dr. Soares Medicaid patients has REFUSED to see her because she is on opioid patient! How is this OK?????  She looses her pain doctor and the Dr. that is supposed to be taking his patients refuses to see her???? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE!!!!!!|I've had numerous visits and never felt Dr Soares was willing to take time to help me. I also had 4 calls to his office that consisted of 3+ hours on hold!

I met Dr.Soares and he's not professional at all, I have multiple disability problems not just one, and he's treating me as if I'm faking which I showed him the information from my chart of what I've all been diagnosed with and he acts like I'm faking my pain which I'm not and he's rude, saying cruel things, makes up lies. If you don't have to I really recommend going to someone else who actually looks into your record's and isn't rude or cruel by stuff he says about u and about names he calls you, he doesn't act professionally at all.|Dr. Soares lied through his teeth about his treatment with my mother. He did nothing but talk down to her and yell at her. Then wrote in her file like he was some sort of God. OH and there was a test that was ordered and NEVER got the results. Fire him and take away his license. He's a quack!|Dr. Soares has giving Me my life back, he created a pain treatment that allows me to handle daily life without so much excruciating pain! Thank you Dr Soares for saving my life!|Awful place!! The nurse and front desk were amazing but I was Dr. Soares. I honestly can't believe that man is a dr.

When he put it in I felt everything I said the meds wasn't working. He did nothing. The trial did not work for me. The Nevro reps where great. When I got done with the trial and went to get the leads pulled. I said as he was taking out the leads that I was hoping it worked. He said it's not for everyone. Then he went to the door, I said is there anything else we could do. He said no and left. I was very upset. Nurse did have some suggestions. I would never go back to him.|Was referred to him as I have had chronic pain since my 20's. Have had injections in the past that did not help for more than 5 minutes.

The doctor herself is very concerned, caring and thorough.|I went to Dr Rakes almost over 2 years ago with the onset of debilitating migraines and this abnormal electric shock feeling I kept getting in my head. I was diagnosed with Chronic Severe Migraines and Trigeminal Neuralgia. She worked with me and placed me on meds that completely cleared me of it all. Unfortunately with any pharmaceuticals there are side effects and I wanted to have a baby which was frowned upon while receiving the meds. I weened off and the headaches began again. She worked with me through the entire time. I tried everything I could under the sun and because of insurance there are steps to take to get to the next level of treatment. I was starting to come to terms with that fact I may have to live with migraines the entire time I want to have children which was a horrible feeling. There was days I had to go to the emergency room and they still could not get the headache to go away. They would send me home and let me know they did all they could, prescribe me a sedative and knock me out and cross fingers it worked. Dr Rakes finally got my insurance to approve Botox and I have no words!!!! It was a complete life changer. My migraines have now turned back into normal headaches and I only get many 5 a month instead of over half the month with a constant migraine. My tension in my neck and shoulders are gone and my TMJ has died down. Botox has been the most life changing drug ever given to me. You receive a lot of injections within that 10 minutes however, they do not hurt and results are mind blowing. I would suggest Dr Rakes for any of your pain issues and especially your migraines. One thing to keep in mind though, you have to take steps and try certain medications due to insurance guidelines until they allow stuff like Botox however, be patient and Dr Rakes will guide you through the process.|One of the worst doctors I've ever seen.

But totally unprofessional and the Dr made me wait 4 dang hours to have my procedure done. And after 4 hours I left. I saw Dr Blair playing with his dog Outback and the whole office was waiting for him to get procedures done. It took him 4 hours to give 2 injections!! All bcz of how unprofessional he was that day. I'm extremely let down and extremely disappointed with this absolute lack of responsibility and respect for the patient who pays their good hard-earned insurance coverage for being seen in a timely fashion. But 4 damn hours and only 2 injections done in that whole time!! Inexcusable and totally unprofessional behavior by Dr Blair. Drs always say time is money, yeah well my money too. I have to pay high gas prices, get up extremely early, and wait 4 damn hours with 3 people in front of me!? And he wasn't even in the clinic. He was gone and playing around with his dog. Plus two people in front of me one poor woman screamed in agony bcz Dr. Blair was so brutal with her knee injections. An elderly man right before I told my ride that he was never going to have his much-needed neck injection done again bcz of Dr. Blair's negligence. The medical school and Hippocratic oath are to ""do no harm"". But Dr Blair hurt and caused harm to two poor older people that day. Imo that's totally wrong and evil. Especially as I heard a poor woman scream out in agony crying about how her knee injection hurt so badly. Then an older man was limping out and he was in so much pain his blood pressure could've caused him to have a stroke it was so high after how much pain he experienced from Dr. Blair's ill-suited hands. I won't ever see Dr Blair again based on this time I waited 4 damn hours when Dr. Blair wasn't in the building and made honest hard-working Americans wait 4 hours to be seen!!|Worst doctors I have went to I was on oral medicine doing just fine I never failed a drug test but they push the pain pump i tried it Angela from the clinic side refilled it in April I came home fell asleep and I woke up with pains going from my tailbone all the way to my ankles the pain never went away and every week that I went in i told her and Dr.Raiker about the pain I told them I wanted the pain pump out cause it was doing more harm than good I got it taken out July 31,24 I had it in for 7 months then he fired me as a patient cause I had it taken out i guess he is going to be losing to much money but now he isn't gonna get money out of me as a patient|My fiance goes here once a month to get his pain meds. This is the 2nd or 3rd time that he's had an 8:45 am appointment and he's had to wait 2 hours or more for a doctor to even show up at the clinic. If the doctor isn't going to be there by 8:45am why even have appointments available for that time? What if he had another appointment scheduled after this one and he missed the next one? Plus he has to drive an hour to get to the pain clinic. They have always had the prescriptions refilled before the doctor has even entered the room to talk to him. How do they even know what to prescribe or refill without talking to the patient first? Ok, rant over. MWA do better!|We drove over 1 hour to Fremont from east of Council Bluffs, IA, for a pain pump refill for my significant other. Signed all the paperwork then they inform us the medicine hadn't shown up. We asked them why they didn't call us and reschedule so we didn't have to drive that far for nothing.  They said they thought the medicine would be there by the time we got there. Won't be going back to the Fremont office. Had problems at the Omaha office before now this. Looking for another pain clinic.|Very compassionate staff and doctors,  I have been to many facilities in the past and would highly recommend anyone in pain to go see the doctors at this clinic.  They treat you with respect, dignity, and will strive to rid your chronic pain in multiple ways.  I can't thank Dr. Raikar and Dr. Jeanie Corde enough for all you do.  And a special thanks to all the nurses and receptionist for your hospitality and kindness.
Once again, highly recommend to anyone with a legitimate pain problem.   Thank you again Midwest Anesthesia for all you do and a huge thank you to Dr Jeannie and all the nurses.|COME HERE IF YOU WANT A DOCTOR TO GIVE YOU LOTS OF OPIATES! I originally came here (from Omaha to Freemont) because my APRN Gentry Klein was very understand and a good nurse. Then my insurance changed and I paid out of pocket because she is such a great understanding nurse.

She is currently on maternity leave.  While she was away I got new insurance and was only able to see the head surgeon here, S.V. Raiker, M.D., and unlike my usual thirty minute visit, with Gentry Klein, APRN (who I consider a Saint in the pain management field) he spent all of maybe two minutes with me before he suggested I get a freaking MORPHINE PUMP IMPLANT SURGERY (he also mentioned the ""whopping amount of pain relief it would provide"", meaning it would get me very high is the literal meaning of that. I had no intention of trying to get pain medication, let alone a surgery, which would cost over like $20 thousand if insurance covered it, but my new coverage wasn't going to do that, so for several, SEVERAL MONTHS every single time I saw Dr. Raikar, he would come in with prescription already in hand and talk about how bad my insurance was for the entire time then leave.  I broke from my coverage with my insurance and did self pay, which they ""claim to accept"", but instead of seeing APRN Klein (as she's on maternity leave) I got the new girl Trisha, I believe it's also an APRN, not sure, but I expressed my outrage from the beginning of how I was made to feel like a drug addict, then I suddenly see the main doctor and he literally suggests after a minute of discussion that I get a morphine pump surgery basically for no reason other then he would make money and make me completely addicted... I'm still astonished this actually took place...  But I confide in her my concerns, you know, the whole doctor patient confidentiality agreement...  Well I clearly can't prove it, but my second time on she tells me how I've tested posative for alcohol in my last UA's, and if I tested posative a third time they would be unable to treat me.  This was my third time and I'd already taken the UA and I signed an OPIATE CONTRACT and I agreed not to take anything containing THC.  OK that is indisputable.

I came in for my last visit knowing they would terminate me as a patient but I was curious just how they would play this card.  I recorded the entire thing on video so anyone who wants to see, just ask I'll reveal all.... , but I was charged a massive amount more then I usual am for self pay.  Then nurse Trisha comes in and asks me how I've been and I tell her very bad I'd been feeling, as I just found out a few days ago one of my closest friends from University passed away. She gave her (false) sympathies, and then told me we had a difficult discussion to have.  She said how she had on several times told me I can not drink alcohol and I tested posative again. I pointed out to her that this was our third time seeing one another and that she only brought up the issue of alcohol in the previous visit.  So basically she said on the second visit after I'd given a UA that I tested posative for alcohol in the last two, and one more and I would be dismissed.  So I had some drink the night before with friends, nothing in the least excessive, but this was basically checkmate.  I can't prove it, but the second I started talking to the nurses about how I felt neglected, targeted, and a victim of medical malpractice as he was trying to get my to go under unnecessary surgery for a morphine implant I definitely didn't need from the main surgeon Dr Raikar, every single visit seemed like I was wasting their time.  On several occasions they even changed my appointment dates so I ended up going days without medication and in terrible terrible pain as a result of this obvious issue over how much the doctor was getting paid from me insurance vs a self pay system.

I'll just say this, as I did in the beginning.  Go here if you want to get over prescribed and addicted to drugs you don't need cause they will gladly do it.

Go to propublica.net and you'll see.  Most prescriptions in NE.|1.5 hr wait in lobby.  30 min wait in room.

Dr Patel made me wait almost 4 hours to be seen. I wasn't given any instructions about a nerve block I was supposed to have today. While waiting almost 4 hours I saw Dr Patel out back walking his dog and taking his sweet time seeing 2 people ahead of me. Just a freakin 2 people ahead and took 4 hours of waiting!! I got fed up and extremely angry bcz of the wait and I left. Plus I was back in a procedure waiting room in a gown and all ready for my procedure. Then I heard a poor woman scream and cry out in pain bcz Dr. Pitel was so brutal injecting her knees, which enraged me!! A Drs Hippocratic oath is ""Do no harm"". And now the dumb modern world one says ""Cause no pain"". But Dr Pitel caused a lot of harm and pain today. I talked to an older male patient and after his procedure, he told a family member that today Dr. Petel hurt him really bad, and his neck injections went very bad. That he'd never have it done again. Dr. Pitel booked a lot of patients with me including only caring about getting paid big money by the majority of people he sees for injections. This clinic overbooks a lot of patients every time I'm there. I'm truly enraged at how unprofessional this clinics Drs can be. Especially Dr. Pitel who imo only cares about getting paid instead of caring for his patients who come to him for relief. I'm truly let down by this and the unprofessionalism of the Drs as they overtook and made me wait almost 4 hours to have a simple injection done. Especially when I saw Dr. Pitel walking his dog around and not even being in the clinic for hours while 2 other patients waited 4 hours to be seen. This truly enraged me. Totally unprofessional and bad management.|Don't go here if you have lots of pain. They don't care about figuring out why. They just want you to keep coming back to make money off you. All they care about is getting you off narcotics doesn't matter if you are in pain or not. I was there for over 4 months trying to get shots for my back so I could then have them lower my daily dose. They kept botching the paperwork to get them approved then blamed me. Now I had been on shots before but not for my back. Insurance wanted the documents showing this. I told them when and where I got them done. Signed the release forms for them. Just for the next month to have to do same thing. Over and over. Yet I was not complying with them. They need to be investigated by the medical board and the DEA.
There is more as well.|My fiance has been in ridiculous pain and trying to get an mri forever with this old worthless stimulator in her back. All she needed was updated paperwork to finally get it figured out and Raiker decides to leave early and cancels her appointment. He's been doing this forever! This place will never change. Ridiculous expensive unnecessary and invasive procedures that don't work for crap.|I've gone to this pain clinic for years now and my experience keeps getting worse. I had a pain pump to give me pain medicine through my spine that was put in by a different clinic. I had that for about three years; I noticed it was bulging and moved around and let this pain clinic know for months. After being ignored for that time, the device worked its way out of my flesh and into the open air - causing a severe spinal infection. They had me go for surgery to get it taken out (while telling me I should get another surgery to get another one put in; My response to that was, ""Heck no!"") The surgeon asked why I took so long to have surgery to get it fixed and I told him, ""I've told your nurse practitioner about this for months and she said there was nothing to worry about."" I had the surgery, only to constantly have spinal fluid pouring out of my spine. The pain clinic told me to stop calling so frequently and said it's ""normal."" I had severe spinal headaches for nearly a month when they finally decided to do another surgery to fix the issue; The surgeon didn't seal my spinal cord correctly. I was miserable and they didn't care. Now the clinic is suggesting a nerve block - another procedure the surgeon could botch. The wait time is ridiculous and the staff doesn't care about you. Go elsewhere.

Edit: The pain clinic can't keep any staff for more than a few weeks, all the practitioners are incompetent and I think I'm done coming here.|My mother goes to this clinic , I take her every month and it use to be fast & good people. Now we are waiting 2 even sometimes 4 hours here.  I'm usually late to work because of it.  This lady always schedules everyone the same day and times making it crowded and no where to sit with extremely long wait times.  I understand that doctor's appointments take time but I don't believe that this is the issue here.  I believe that the doctor is just not that great and doesn't schedule people the right way.  I work in healthcare & to me this is just crazy.|I've been going to this pain clinic for about 2 years now. When I started, it was great. The last few months, my visits were taking around 4 to 5 hours. People waiting to be called back They are They were laying on the floor sleeping  The nurse had called a woman back that was sleeping in the chair. She had been waiting for about 5 hours. The nurse stood by the door offering no assistance to the lady. She was in the chair crying because she couldn't get up So myself and a few other people had helped her up and over to the door to the nurse I had talked to the pa about doing the Paint pump so I went out to the fremont clinic and I was very anxious and scared to have this procedure done They called me back, laid me face down on a table. The 2 nurses were talking about their children's baseball game. And told me the doctor would be in in a few minutes He was not even in the building. He was still driving to the location. I laid there for about a 1/2 an hour. They didn't even acknowledge that I was in the room. The doctor came in, told me. You will feel some pressure in a pinch. But please do not move told that I needed to go to the recovery room for about an hour. I went to the recovery room for about 10 minutes and they told me I could leave mind you. I have never met doctor Riker's before. Never even seen the man's face he come in and done a procedure on me. Didn't even introduce himself after that i could not get off the table and the nurses did not even help me I struggled for about 5 minutes to get up. And then I was told I was supposed to wait in the recovery room for about an hour. After ten minutes, the nurse told me I could leave fter that trial I felt like I was being pushed in the having this procedure done. Almost bullied in a way I almost felt like if I did not get the procedure done They would not continue itreating me for my pain I would not recommend this this pain management clinic to anybody|Probably the one competent pain clinic in the state, I should know since I've been to a lot. This is the first place I've been to that had doctors who I didn't have to teach about medicine (which is how it should be.) I understand from reviews it looks like they used to have some staffing problems but right now they're training a lot of people and I haven't had any unreasonable wait times personally. Linan especially is one of the most competent healthcare providers I've ever interacted with and takes my pain seriously which is very refreshing after years of being told to ""just live with it"".

Update: they got rid of the only good pain doctor I've ever found|Been going here for about 4 months and when I started I felt so comfortable the physician Nikki listened to me and you could tell she really cared and wanted to help. She was always on time to the appts never waited more than a few minutes. Recently she has moved on and it's been a nightmare between waiting over 45 minutes to an hour and getting your meds plus the communication. A week ago I had called as I had to take more of my pain meds then normal due to a neck issue and it was ok'd but they wouldn't send anymore which was fine I just made sure I had enough until today when I had to see dr again. This morning I had to have a tooth cut out of my mouth mind you I satin dentist chair for an hr and 45 mins and my dentist prescribed medication for pain.

I showed up in 2013 with a terrible case of crps and was in terrifying pain and immobility. He stood up for me and was the only one who would truly do something to help me. He is agressive and serious about treating pain. However, this is because he really knows what its like to hurt from experience. He will do something about your pain and attack it because he want his patience to have relief. If your not prepared for serious action then he might not be right for you but if you are in true desperate pain, he will change your life. He fought so hard to get me a cervical stimulator which did fail in 2014 due to a different surgeon after a perfect trial done by Dr. Raikar. He is an incredible mastermind. There is nobody better than him period.

However, at this point I experience relief. He showed me what was possible. I let him down tremendously with a slipping off with my pain medications. But what Dr. Raikar doesnt know is that I straightened up right away at my first chance. I completely turned my life around and started my own company. All because of his incredible injections he bought me time. I stayed honed in for almost 9 years on that relief from that stimulator.

Fast forward to 2023 and I had now spent 4 years being told nobody can get this stimulator in my body correctly. But I would tell them that I saw a guy do it like nothing. I finally had 2 of the most incredible surgeons install a new stimulator to perfection. It has saved my life and completely turned me around again after another near fallout from pain. My point is he was right. What everyone else saw as crazy and too extreme was exactly what I needed. But, Dr. Raikar isnt afraid. He will try. Things arent always perfect but Dr. Raikar I appreciate you more than I have words for. Ive never forgotten what you did and I hope Ive made you proud. We did it. I have it installed and I am one very successful guy. I am still working on my conscience of letting you and Lee down so bad but we are getting better. My new pain Doc is helping me through it. I landed  the best in Northern Colorado. A whole team now that has been astounded by your abilities and insights you gave me. Wish you could see how amazing I am doing now with this thing at c3 through c8.
I still think about you a lot and you take care!!!!
Thank you for believing in me you had to know that I never turned back|This doctor straight up botched my spinal surgery. I had a pain pump that was put in by a different clinic. I had let the nurse practitioner know for months the device was moving and bulging; She said there was nothing to worry about. Eventually the device worked its way outside of my flesh and into the open air - causing a severe spinal infection. I came in for surgery to have it removed. He suggested I get another surgery to have a new pain pump put in but I refused. He didn't seal up my spinal cord properly and I was leaking spinal fluid for nearly a month, all while calling the clinic and being told ""it's normal"" and they asked me to stop calling them so much. Finally they decided to fix the leak in my spinal cord. I wouldn't have any procedure done by this surgeon!|I have been seeing Dr. Raikar since 2002 in both Fremont and Omaha, plus some of his satellite offices.  The Fremont location is state of the art and has separation from the Office, Surgery Center, & PT.  He is one of the nation's leading pain specialist for many years and there is no one like him in the Midwest at all.  His patient load is extreme due to his Specialty and half the time he is in surgery, which personally I have had many.  His staff support is Amazing.  Be prepared to wait at any of the offices, bring a book or tablet, it's worth waiting to be treated by the Best of the Best.|I don't have 100% relief but with back injuries you never do no matter what. He's awesome and I love how he gets the injections done quick and spot on with no poking around several times trying to find the spot. The staff is AMAZING I wouldn't go see anyone else ever.|I take my 90 year mother there several times a year for procedures and appointments to relieve back pain.  We have to wait well over an hour, sometimes up to two hours every time.   Dr. Raikar has no respect for a patient's time. The procedures he performs help the pain, but we are strongly considering finding another doctor even if we do have to travel into Omaha.   It would take less time to drive to and from Omaha than it does to sit in his waiting room.|Total joke of a doctor.  Only after your money.  I came in originally and when I had Medica Insurance it was plenty of time and service, then I had to switch this year and it went from a actual Dr visit to about two minutes where he would just walk in the room prescription in hand hand just complain about my insurance then leave.  Oh and the very first time I saw him, I was on a low dose of oxycodone, and he immediately suggested I get a 20+ thousand dollar surgery to have a freaking morphine pump installed.  Said it would give me a real ""whopping"" amount of pain relief, I.e. get me very high and addicted.  Yeah, thanks but no thanks Dr. They make you sign a no THC contract, but they will find any excuse to terminate you as a client and leave you with nothing but painful withdrawals if they feel their not extracting enough money from you or your insurance.  Great job guys..|All I can say is that him and his APRN Melissa Okun don't want to listen, my husband took 3years backwards, they have him on oxycodone and we both said that it does nothing for him. My husband has No quality of life. Thank you so much for setting him back, where he used to have 4 good days to zero. We started out with oxy and hydro.

He was not satisfied with that response and asked if it was pain, i reiterated that it felt tense and uncomfortable.

Thanks Dr Saorez....for nothing!|I've been to my fair share of Pain Management Dr's. I had been seeing Dr. Raikar, who had me pumped up on narcotic pain medicine, and treated me like an experimental pain cushion. Although some injections helped, he never kept up with those injections. He always came up with a reason to do other injections/procedures, that offered no help at all. Then, he kept pressuring me to allow him to put in another type of internal stimulator, than the 1 i have. Overall, it had me worried, for my long term health. So my Dr. suggested Dr. Soares. And so far, I've gotten my pain medicine cut in half. While it is affecting me to a degree, he is at least working with my surgeon to come up with the best way to move forward. And for that, I am truly appreciative.|Soares has a very poor attitude when it comes to listening to his patients! I have been on Oxycodone for over 4 years and every time I had to go see him for about 5 minutes, he was always trying to trick me into saying that it's not working and was going to take me off of oxycodone. I've tried about everything else but oxycodone was the only thing that worked. He put me on a pain patch that I told him that I've tried before and it didn't work but it was either that or nothing.I happened to have a rotator cuff surgery and my surgeon gave me oxycodone along with a couple of other medications when I had a script from Soares and that really set Soares off. He immediately got mad telling me I was non compliant and he was taking it away. He also used the excuse that I couldn't be trusted to take my meds right. I had told him that if I didn't need it for a day or so, I wouldn't take it. He said that I wasn't taking it according to his instructions, and that's all it to to have it taken away. There are several other issues that come into play that I'm not going to get into now, so I'm just going to stop here. Final answer is  he has a terrible attitude and I wouldn't recommend seeing him! He started out as a decent guy but got a lot worse! I understand that the regulations for opioids have changed and it may not be all his fault but I think there are a lot better ways to work with the patient.|I went to him for my back pain and he was rude and didn't listen to a word i said or my chart. I was taking tramadol and told him it does not help at all he tells me that is all he would prescribe. He told me he could do a lumbar block and they would contact my insurance to see if it was covered and they would let me know. That was last November and i still haven't heard from his office. When I called them to ask about the procedure they told me someone would call me back.
well I have still not heard back from his office. This Doctor is a quack and needs to retire. Worst doctor I have been to.|The only reason I give this so-called doctor a 1 star is so I can give a review.  Save your money and time!! He tried to tell me my pain is in my left lumbar, when he clearly was looking at my MRI, I got up, said no thank you and left.
He has no manners and treated me like a idiot.|Dr. Soares is always very professional and has been my pain doctor for a few years now.  The staff is very friendly and professional too.  All my pain is managed very well because of Dr. Soares.

I did tell him I did not want to change my medications which are via my PCP, so I cannot say how it goes to talk to him about narcotics. My PCP had told me when he referred to Soares that he is conservative about narcotics--which i strongly prefer. I have seen other pain management docs who brushed off my pain. Soares was so much better. He was kind, listened, and recognized my diagnosis and how CRPS was 'missed'. He has the experience with CRPS that a lot of metro doctors don't. We talked about a spinal implant and I had a LOT of questions; when he didn't know the answer, he admitted it. And, on a follow up, he had that answer, so he looked into it. Listen, seeing a pain doc is a BAD TIME. If you're (legitimately) here, you're in debilitating pain, probably at the end of your rope and desperate. Maybe he can help, maybe not, but as a doctor he's a good one.",2024-05-01|2024-03-06|2023-01-20|2023-08-27|2022-04-19|2023-09-27|2024-04-17|2022-05-16,1|1|4|1|1|1|5|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJkR0MEPyMk4cR6psmRH3PcyE,33

He takes his time, listens, explains everything, & always has my best interest at heart. The dr's who administer my epidurals, are very efficient, quick, gentle & godsends.

She has been treating for her pain for the past 20+ years and has never been treated poorly until transferring here. She transferred her pain management care here due to her last provider retiring and this is the only facility left in this area who can provide pain management services with controlled substances. I had a very upsetting experience with this nurse practitioner when she saw my grandma, who is hard of hearing. From the start, she walked in with a scowl on her face, which immediately made my grandmother feel uneasy. Her tone was snippy and condescending, and it was clear she didn't have the patience or understanding for someone with hearing difficulties. When my grandma asked her to repeat something, instead of speaking more clearly or trying to help, the nurse practitioner just seemed annoyed, which was incredibly frustrating and disrespectful. It's deeply concerning that someone in a healthcare role would treat elderly, hard-of-hearing patient this way. She also kept saying my grandma was argumentative. My response to this is she is clearly in pain. You should be trained to handle negative interactions when someone is in pain and be more understanding. Especially when reducing her pain medication in half after she has been on the same dose for over 10+ years. If reduction is necessary, tapering off gradually should be the correct step. She also does not talk to my grandma in a way she understands by explaining her reasons for reducing her medication like a grown adult, she just acts cold and says: ""why don't you have your social worker prescribe you meds then?"" My Grandma doesn't understand all of the medical jargon which is why I went with her to this last appointment, and she is depressed and anxious about having to interact with this provider. Oh, and two weeks ago was supposed to be her appointment. My grandma showed me her card. I drove all the way to her appointment, plus my grandma has to get ready to go out in the cold, to be told she doesn't have an appointment. So, two weeks later at this appointment, I asked the Nurse Practitioner what happened, she said my grandma stormed off before it got scheduled. I find this hard to believe since my grandma is in a wheelchair and can't move without someone pushing her wheelchair. My Grandma told me it was the nurse practitioner who stormed off and said my grandma is too difficult to deal with. She left her ALONE in the patient room to open up a heavy door and ask for help to get out. The nurse practitioner also wrote it on the card when her appointment was, so my grandma left under the impression she has an appointment. I came with her to this appointment because she felt she was being mistreated, and I wanted to make sure she was getting the attention and care she needed. I wasn't expecting this level of treatment. Healthcare providers, especially those who deal with patients experiencing pain, should be properly trained in how to manage not only the physical aspects of pain but also the emotional and behavioral challenges that often come with it. Patients in pain can become frustrated, anxious, or even irritable, and it's essential for providers to approach them with empathy, patience, and understanding. Effective communication is key, especially when it comes to patients who may have additional challenges, like being hard of hearing or elderly. A provider who is trained in pain management should be able to recognize these behaviors and respond in a way that makes the patient feel heard and respected, rather than dismissed or frustrated. Unfortunately, we were told she can't transfer providers as the clinic has a policy that she needs to stay with the provider she started with. I understand this policy because you shouldn't doctor hop to get the medication you want, but because of the disconnect in communication and the personality clash/disrespect I would think this would be considered. I will look into telehealth as there is no other provider in this area for pain management.|The arthritis in both of my hands is so severe that I could not do simple functions and had almost zero grip, until I was referred to Dunes Pain Specialists..  I am so thankful for everything they do for me, and they are so mindful of my overall health. Thank you all for giving me back a better quality level of health to my life.|For the last 3-4 years I have been a patient of the Dunes Pain Specialist in Dakota Dunes and everything was fine up until recently. I really enjoyedy Drs that I had and felt like I was heard by the Drs to help get to the bottom of my pain management. The problem that I had was just recently, I got sick with walking Pneumonia and the Dr and nurses made it possible to still have my appt over telehealth while I was sick. However, I guess they expect you to call even when you're sick on your death bed to call and schedule the next appointment and didn't tell me this during my telehealth visit, they just assumed I knew. When it came to scheduling my next appointment my husband made the call for me and was told there were no available appointments in November so they scheduled me a visit on Dec 9!!!! Called my pharmacy to request a refill on meds (controlled substances that will send someone into withdrawal) and they denied it stating that I needed to have a face to face visit which is fine but not until Dec9! They offered to send in a med to help with withdrawal and when I tried to plead my case to them (having pneumonia which I'm still battling) the nurse got nasty and snippy with me. I did match her tone, she kept asking me if I wanted a copy of my ""contract"" if I understood the terms of it and when I asked her if she understood that I have been really really sick with pneumonia this nurse pretty much hung up on me. I'm frustrated with this place because I am being ""punished"" having my contract terminated and my healthcare stopped here because the nurse Bethany was rude to me and to my husband when he called!! When I called back down there today I was told that the Dr decided to terminate and keep it that way! My suggestion to people looking to Dr here is be very very very careful because as it seems that nurse in particular most likely wasn't honest with the Drs and told them I was rude and hostile on the phone and I absolutely was not! It was very apparent they can treat you like absolute crap and get away with it! Also you can't be extremely sick and miss Manning an appointment!|I have had good experiences with DPS. I find my situation and pain levels are taken seriously and followed up in a timely manner. David King clicks with me and under a hands my situations, pains, and problematic issues.|My wife has been in terrible pain for months and has been going here to try and get relief.  She told me that when she calls to ask questions that they have been very rude.  I just listened to the most recent call and rude would have been refreshing.  As the nurse was belittling my wife because the doctors are ""so busy"" I jumped in and told her that they way she was treating ny wife was not ok.
If I had an employee treat my patient or customer that way I would be appalled and would fire them immediately for fear that they are costing me money by turning patients away.  You would think that with the amount of money that they charge for their treatments that they could afford to have some training on customer service and how to have some sympathy for the patients that are just trying to find some relief.  I did get the name of the lady we spoke to but in the interest of being decent I won't post it.  By not posting its my hope that they overhaul their phone etiquette across the board.|What a complete waste of time!!!! Tells you your scheduled then turns around and says your not. Very disappointed as I go through excruciating pain everyday! They claim to oh care so much about your pain but they don't in my opinion!!!! Due to all this I cancelled my contract as I don't like being misled!!!|Dr Jermey Paulson is an amazing doctor. He is the only one I trust when it comes to burning my nerves and given me all my other epidurals for pain. His colleague David King is wonderful too.

Attentive, asked all the right questions, and was not at all rushed in discussing my needs and explaining the course of treatment for my back issues.

Ashley stayed with me from start to finish and was a huge part in making me comfortable. she explained everything from start to finish of my appointment and was reassuring when I needed injections. The injections were not comfortable but her and the doctor talked and coached me through them.

I appreciate the transparency the firm has pertaining to forms, records requests, and extra steps they took to ensure there was no history or drug abuse as prescriptions for medications were needed.|Had a terrible experience here, probably the worst of my life. I wasn't supposed to eat before my procedure, but wasn't told. So when I came in and informed them I'd eaten, they said it was fine and that the anesthesia would just be ""tapered"".
The shot I got was the most painful experience of my life, I was screaming on the table.
I would've happily rescheduled rather than go through this. They never mentioned extra pain as a result of less anesthesia.
I expressed how upset I was, a doctor never came and spoke to me. They just sent me on my way, not caring at all how upset I was.
I'm concerned that I have nerve damage in my back now because I was flopping around like a fish on the table with a needle in my back.
I can't believe this just happened to me|Impossible to get in touch with. PAs see patients and can only discuss 1 questions per visit. Practice attempted to set up a procedure with me on the wrong body part entirely because their records were mixed up. Doctor did a procedure, gave me instructions for aftercare, and rolled me out the door despite my pain having been so severe I was falling and passing out. Now they are unreachable and not taking appointments and I have been unable to get around safely on my own for a week after this surgery. There is nobody at this practice who has any care or concern for the well being or healing of patients.|Dr Lee is very nice, however last time I was seen by PA Christina Soliman and was made to feel like a junkie needing her fix. Mind you,... I hadn't been there in over a year as I only come in if my neck gets too tight. Most medications do not work to loosen up the knots I get in my neck and shoulder. As someone who only comes in once or twice every 1-2 years I don't feel they should be telling me about not prescribing certain medications because of the risk of misuse. Use your PMP people! I don't doctor shop and yes am in fact an RN whose body is basically falling apart from caring for patients in the ER the past 20 years! Not everyone is looking to get high when they come in... and yes, some people generically need stronger meds. I feel sorry for DR Lee as he is great but this practitioner needs some more training or to see how she feels after 2 decades of lifting, moving, restraining patients! Also, the front desk staff either didn't get pre approval or didn't use an anesthesiologist that was covered and certainly didn't tell me I was going to receive a bill for almost $900 for an epidural in my neck that didn't even work. Dr Lee, you are great but the rest of the office needs work. I don't think I will be back as your PA made me feel as though I was a drug seeker and that's terrible.|Dr.lee is the best doctor I've known.he has the most awesome staff they all are hands on and very kind.im sending all thanks to Ciara.Mahea..Maylene..Mariah..thank u all so much for a job well done keep up the good work..Pamela south|My medication was due four days ago. I have called consistently, emailed and wrote several messages on there helow app. The staff has been nothing, but rude and disrespectful. The front office have lied to me day after day stating that it will be handled by the end of day....well this is day four and I've had to go to the hospital two times because of this! I can't walk without assistance and I've had several failed back surgeries. I have extremely bad pain from not only that but cancer. I was yelled at by Amanda . The Doctor called my medication into the wrong pharmacy and now it's all of a sudden my fault and here four days later nothing still hasn't been called in and to top it off I'm being yelled at and disrespected by Amanda. What happened to being professional, and showing some compassion for someone who's in extreme pain and can't even get out of bed without my medication.  It's now the end of the fourth day on a Friday and I called the office back at 4:00 p.m , I've been on hold for 55 minutes, so I decided to call back on my sons phone and they picked up on the first ring, so that proves that they screen there calls and Nasi hung up the phone as soon as she knew it was me! I can't believe this is what they do to there patients. I wonder if the Doctors are aware of how the front desk is sabotaging there bussiness!|I go in for weekly pain pump adjustments and met PA Maureen who started training this week. She is wonderful, very personable, most professional as it's the first time that the PA has first introduced themselves since Shay a few months back. Keep doing what you're doing Maureen, you'd make an excellent permanent team member there at Primmed.|2 years I was in pain day in night out after a surgery in 2022, the doctors  ""didn't know"" what they could do or why I can't sit, stand, walk, and especially run post-operative. Moved here, got a new referral from my primary to this place-and 5 min!!! 5 min it took Dr. Mohajer to identify the nerves that were hit during that surgery, order insurance approval and do my shots! I can walk better, still limping a bit but don't really use the walker anymore. And I actually get sleep now, since my pain level is manageable! Dr. Mohajer and Dr.Tio are the best. The whole team is great actually, always nice, always smiling, alway neat, and actually super helpful. Special thanks to Abner, Rachel and Andrea. The impact on the quality of my life-unmeasurable!

Mayra is always friendly and talks with each patient while having a smile on her face. I have always felt comfortable and welcomed the minute I walk through the door each month. Every staff member treats each patient with high respect. The owner, Dr Campbell is so very kind and sweet. They truly care about every person here at Center For Wellness & Paincare. As a patient going through a weird illness, they have helped navigate my illness and get me the care that I need.

5 starts!!|It's hard to get a hold of anyone over the phone, but when someone decides to call you back after you left a message for over a week, it takes about 3-4 weeks to get in an appointment within your schedule. So when I finally schedule a new patient appointment for 3/18/24, it was canceled because their provider isn't available. Mind you, only the NPs see new patients. When requested to see MD/DO, I was told they only see patients with workman's comp or auto accidents. Anyway, new appointment was rescheduled to today 3/25/24 @9a. Arrived 8:30a and doors are locked. So I kept peeping through the tinted windows to see if anyone is in there. I caught one of the front desk's girl attention so she opened the door for me and asked if I had an appointment, my name, DOB, and also confirmed my phone number. Then she proceeded to tell me that I should've gotten a phone call this morning that my appointment was canceled. At this point I'm just frustrated and left. No apologies and no offers to make it right or even to reschedule. Don't waste your time and find yourself a different pain management practice.|The entire staff is caring and responsive. The doctors are willing to chat at length about you and how you can improve. The NPs are knowledgeable and wanting what is best for their patients.  Great place if you're looking for results.|Bradley Tran, M.D., Center for Wellness and Pain Care of Las Vegas (CWPC), is Outstanding as my Chronic Pain Management Specialist and he provides excellent treatments that have significantly lowered my Monthly Pain Level Averages. When you're in pain, long Waiting Room times or having to re-explain your chart history can get frustrating. So, finding a quality Pain Management Specialist with great communication skills, an excellent memory and a well run office is a Godsend. Going to this Pain Care Center every month for the last 10 years I've talked with many new patients and listened to a lot of horror stories. CWPC could improve their Phone Wait-Times and their Message Response-Times but the Phone/Message-Response Wait-Times with pharmacies and health insurance are same. CWPC ticks all the other basic boxes, including many Specialized Treatments and uses ""Healow"" the best Patient Phone App of all my Doctors. If you need an outstanding Pain Management Specialist make an appointment to see Dr. Bradley Tran.

After the procedure I called the office to get some help because I was in so much pain that I literally wanted to die, they said they wouldn't give me anything for the pain. Went to the follow up appointment where they said they won't give me anything else to help because the medications they have prescribed didn't work (I told them before they prescribed it that none of it has ever worked in the past 10 years but they wouldn't give me the things that did help previously)
When I was leaving in tears and I said ""I just don't understand how you could have someone telling you they want to die because they are in so much pain and you won't do anything to help them"" Dr Baird seriously told me ""well I don't have a magic tool box"". No, no magic tool box, but you do have a magic prescription pad that you could magically fill out for something to help me but instead you'd rather I keep paying hundreds of dollars to continue to be in an insane amount of pain with no relief in sight. Thanks a lot.|What a fantastic office this is! I have nothing but positive things to say about my entire experience here, from start to finish.

HANDS DOWN!!! I have been in pain management for years  because of continued spinal issues, etc. I've had extensive surgery and am still in chronic pain! Over all these years I have seen at least 7 different ""pain management"" doctors. NOT ONE has helped me the way Dr. Travnicek has!! She is so understanding, listens to all your concerns, does everything in her power to help control the pain. Her compassion is so heartwarming, she is a doctor who really cares about her patients' and their well being. I have been her patient since 2019, I finally found a doctor that has actually helped me! She is so incredibly knowledgeable in her field. I will never see another pain management Dr. other than her. She is exactly what one needs when looking for help when the pain is so excruciating and one just does not know where to turn! Turn to Dr. T!

Also, making an appointment is simple. I have never had to wait to get in to see her. The wait time when you arrive and get checked in, is maybe 5 minutes or less. That was shocking to me considering I have waited an hour or more to see other doctors. Her staff is so kind and considerate as well. From Barbara and Rachel at the front desk to Soraya her triage nurse, it's simply the perfect place to be, especially when you are in pain and can't sit and wait to see a doctor for 20, 30 minutes or longer!

I hope for anyone who needs pain management that they read this comment and make an appointment with Dr. Travnicek. You will be SO happy you did. I feel blessed to have found her!
Sincerely, Lori...a very happy patient!|Dr Travnicek provides the upmost care. She listens to me and and my concerns and provides the best course of action. I have been to several doctors who seem to look at their patients as money makers and push them through their office. Dr Travnicek does not do this. She is very patient, great at diagnosing, and coming up with plans that provide pain relief.

The medical assistants and front staff are all wonderful as well. They are always welcoming and discrete. Dr Travnicek has a great practice and am happy to have found her practice.|I have been going to pain management for over 20 years; finding Dr Travnicek was an answer to my prayers! She is extremely professional, along with displaying empathey and compassion. My appointments never feel rushed and she takes the time to truly listen to my needs. First time in a long time I don't feel like just a number being herded through. If I had to say there was one small caveat, it would be that the wait times are a little long. Great doctor, super staff!|Dr Travnicek was able to diagnose and fix my lower back problems and now I'm back to being able to exercise, bend over and stand for a much longer periods.  The treatments were almost pain free and she and her staff are professional and cheerful and quickly put one at ease. Highly recommend her!|Amazing Doctor!! I am one of Dr. Travincek patients and love how she interacts with her patients; she listens to her patients concerns and truly cares about all she helps. I highly recommend
her to anyone looking for a pain doctor. When I was first seen by her, I could tell she was compassionate, caring and unlike any other doctor I have been seen by.  She is one of the BEST!!|I am so happy that my cousin Michelle Gardea told me about Dr. Travnicek. I came to her for a second opinion for steroid epidurals instead of 5 epidurals she said two would be the best for my situation. We did the procedure last week and the inflammation is so much better. I am back to PT and on a road to recovery because of the Pain Institute. When or if i need anything else done to my spine i will be seeing Dr T. Thank you and your staff!|I felt validated and respected by all the staff. The Doctor was very compassionate.
I received trigger point injections and I experienced some relief.
I hope to continue to build my relationship with Dr Travnicek.|Dr. Travnicek is one of those doctors that takes her time to get to know her patients. Those kind of doctors.

On top of that for about 3 years I have been dealing with on and off excruciating pain that leaves me in and out the hospital every month. I'm only 28 so the impact of my condition on my life is really draining. Having to plan trips, activities and holidays around the possibility of being in the hospital for pain management really takes a toll on my mental state especially since I'm a very adventurous person, a mom of 2 and a full time employee. Dr. Cloe is truly amazing! With everything I have dealt with I didn't have much expectations. She listened to my issues and quickly came up with a plan. Although my pain is not 100% gone she has gotten it to a manageable spot where I avoid the hospital and the fear of not being able to plan events and activities due to possibly canceling has gone away. Again even though the pain is not 100% gone I am able to stay home lay in bed and find comfort in my own home. The stress on my significant other, that has been with me though it all (and high school sweetheart) has been lifted. He now doesn't have to miss work to be with me at the hospital and finds comfort knowing I'm home. I truly appreciate her so much and appreciate her making this condition a little more tolerable.

I highly recommend this place.|Katie has been my Chronic Pain treatment provider for several years, ever since my previous doctor quit practicing with almost no notice. She and her staff are skilled, highly competent providers, and treat patients with nothing but kindness and a genuine willingness to help--true patient advocates. If something isn't working, Katie readily offers other avenues to help my pain. I'm always seen on time, and appointment confirmations are appreciated reminders!|I have been to the Carson City location, as well as, the Reno location. I am not exaggerating when I say that Nevada Advanced Pain Specialists have saved my life. I was in 9/10 pain for 2 weeks waiting for a PCP Referral. I was not sleeping because of this pain and began to feel hopeless. My daughter started calling around and found that this facility doesn't need a referral. They also have a Sparks location. No pain management wants to treat Severe TMJ with my insurance except for these pain clinics. I was seen as a new patient within a week. I was fortunate to only need nerve pain medication for this severe pain. I took the first dose, and was relieved within 1 hour. These clinics also offer at least 6 different modalities to treat TMJ. If you are looking for kindness, understanding,  extreme professional and above and beyond proficiency in pain management, please make an appointment at a location near you!|I have been to the practice several times. All of the staff has been so wonderful. Both Dr. Patterson and Jill have been amazing.  Jill is so very patient and thorough and I truly feel she is so patient. She does not rush my appointments, she listens, and I feel she truly cares to make every effort to help me become pain free. I have absolutely no complaints and would  recommend this practice.|Shaylee is an awesome provider!

Also when an issue occurred with my medicine he fixed it in a timely fashion.  Thank you so much!!|This review is specifically for Lazaro Cueto, RN. I had seen him from April to November 2024 for lower back pain. On my follow up visit for my last procedure, I asked him if the treatment I had gone through could help get insurance's approval for a breast reduction. The very first thing he said was ""What would your husband say?""

I was taken aback by the blatant sexism but tried to laugh it off. However, he proceeded to keep ranting about how my husband would definitely not be okay if I got a reduction and if his wife ever tried to get a reduction, he would leave her.

I feel very sorry for his wife and upset that when I ask my health provider and health-related question, his answer is to belittle his patient.|This is the best, professional and excellent service I've ever received from any medical provider, they always treat me with respect, the nurses are always smiling and always treat our concerns with privacy.

And my doctor, Doctor Carlos, is an excellent doctor who really cares about my treatments and will do everything he can to help me get better. Jema and Dr. Carlos are the reasons I will always remain at Center for Wellness and Pain. Thank you Jema and Dr. Carlos|I'm an emergency contact for the patient, & I always attend their monthly appointments with them. Over the past year, I have had to exclusively take over communications between them & this clinic. I am burnt out just from my experiences over the phone. Here are some highlights on what to expect when you join the Center for Wellness and Pain Care.

October 2023, the patient I referenced was attempting to make their monthly follow-up via TeleHealth. However, a representative at the clinic said the request was denied because a copy of the patient's late sibling's death certificate was needed in order for the visit to be approved; they cited the patient's insurance as the entity that needed it. Their sibling had never gone to or interacted with the clinic in any way. We phoned the insurance company, who told us that, no, a death certificate was not necessary in order to be covered for a TeleHealth appointment. I called the clinic back on the patient's behalf to inform them of this. After some back & forth, suddenly they had no idea who had even requested this.

March 2024, the clinic told the patient they needed an updated yearly referral from their primary to continue being seen--that if it couldn't be procured before the patient's upcoming appointment, they would be turned away. Once again, cited as insurance requiring it. We went to obtain the referral in 3 ways from the primary, who explained to us that insurance did NOT require a yearly referral. Just the initial referral. Insurance corroborated this. Regardless, he faxed it, sent it over electronically, & gave me a physical copy to hand to the front desk. Clinic received it on time and approved it.

Currently, December 2024, we are now being informed that the clinic had never received any referral for the year of 2024. This is despite the confirmation we received initially that the patient was good to go for the year, as well as the tangible document detailing the referral. This is also despite approximately 8 months straight of the patient having covered appointments. I asked how the patient has even been seen without the referral, in that case, and was told that they could still be seen, but that insurance might not process it. Again, their insurance does not require annual referrals, only the initial one. This contradicts every other claim where an annual referral was needed or they couldn't be seen at all. Because of the constant discrepancies in communication, we are to assume that this document has been lost, though the person I spoke to could not even confirm whether or not the clinic kept a backlog of referrals to see when the last one WAS sent. First a yes, then a maybe, then a no.

Also, I have gone back and forth for nearly 90 days with the clinic & our pharmacy to look for suitable options to extended release medications that the patient can take, as their usual medication went on backorder and has since not been obtainable. Because of this, the patient has been without half of their medication for at least 2 months; despite this being out of the patient's hands, a provider has threatened to disengage them from therapy for submitting a clean UA, BECAUSE they have no medication to take. The IR med is empty and due for refill around each monthly appointment, adding insult to injury.

Some other things to note: While any provider will ask you to reach out for problems regarding prescribed medications, they will take several days & multiple ""high priority"" requests to complete time sensitive tasks for you. Call takers will frequently say they need to call you back; they almost never do. Any updates to the patient's file, the patient or trusted party has to go after the clinic for it. Providers will also attempt to go against a patient's pharmacy's protocol by neglecting to change instructions in hand with medication adjustments, & deliberately prescribing higher quantities than actually dispensable because ""I've never heard of a pharmacy that doesn't allow THAT.""

For precious publicity's sake, hopefully, this is all occurring under Dr. Campbell's nose.|I have been going to this office for a year I've had a few injections. I started planning on a joint in September. I was at a hotel and they did an early check out, and my prescriptions are taken. All of my clothing was thrown away, including my insulin pump.

I came back My appointment in November and they placed me on a probation stating that I tested negative and I haven't taken any test.

They're putting extra strain on my body. Which is no problem I don't mind coming in and taking the test but because I know that I am taking the medication, but I was told today now they want me to bring in the pills as well so they can count my pills  clearly making me uncomfortable especially since I've had a major surgery I'm offended this how they treat me there patience as I explained to him today, but I can pull my hospital records and my labs or I have clearly been taking the medication|Again I had a great experience with Dr Tran and his clinical staff despite having a quite complicated medical procedure. I have been treated by Dr Tran for over two years and even traveled to his new location when he relocated his practice. Why? ... because I trust his medical judgment and ability to identify the true problem and a solution that invasive enough to help without causing more harm... because his hands where precise and gentle in multiple procedures he performed on me ... and equally importantly he is able to actually listen to my concerns and address appropriately.

Well I was so off base it makes me happy to know that this place can actually help me. I suffer from a bad leg due to sciatic issues, this place, the lady who was there to evaluate me is amazing. She found all my difficulties just by watching me for a few minutes. My favorite thing is the spinal stimulator that I remember being nothing more than a glorified tens machine now has abilities beyond anything I could have imagined. The thought that this device could possibly reduce my pain levels?!?! Heaven. So I am leaving myself in their very capable hands with no fear. This place will hopefully get me to a healthy way of life and not becoming a couch potato because of pain. I'm 62 yrs old and I finally have hope. If you need a good place for pain management this is it. I will update this in a couple of months so let you all know my progress. For now I'm letting go of the controls and allow them to show me a means to have better control of my life.|Cloe is the absolute best!

She always gives me her full attention.  She has never pushed me to have any procedure that I am not comfortable with.  She gives me the options and let's me make up my own mind. I would recommend this practice to anyone dealing with chronic pain.|I see Cloe there and have for a few years. SHE IS AMAZING!  I stay there because of her. I don't like that the office won't allow her to sign my mmc card. I don't like that Dr Dennis is not a straight shooter but he has been a decent dr. I don't like they won't help a person get disability or sign for them to get any kind of assistance. But I have been having my meds thru them since 2012 so they must do something right. If I could give Cloe a rating she would get 10 out of 10! She has been an amazing provider for me for years now and I adore her!|Jill is a excellent healthcare provider.

I have tried numerous times to work out this supposed debt with this office. I have called them on three way calls with my insurance company as well as with the PCP who sent the referral. I have insurance and because their office didn't do their job correctly, the insurance company kicked it back. Now they want to stick me with the bill because they didn't make sure my referral was in the patient portal before seeing me. I called to make sure they accepted my insurance ahead of time to make sure I wouldn't get stuck with a bill. The insurance company said they would have to eat this cost because they dropped the ball. I don't believe I should be stuck with a bill, when I have insurance, got the referral from my PCP, and did everything I was supposed to do prior to seeing them. I have repeatedly tried to get this issue resolved to no avail. Now they have sent me to collections. I saw Dr. Brimhall, who was very compassionate and understanding; however, the billing department or whoever deals with their referrals needs more training. As a practice, they should not penalize their patients when the office doesn't do what they should be doing in the correct manner in which they should do it. I would recommend checking with the referral department, billing department, and insurance company prior to seeing any doctor in this office or you may find yourself hit with a hefty bill.|Grateful!! That is the main word I would use to describe how I feel about the care I have received at Nevada Pain Care. I just want to say that both Andrew Gephardt and Dr. Eric Brimhall are excellent providers. I feel lucky to have found them. They are by-the-books, caring, and professional without a doubt. I really couldn't have asked to find better. They have gone above and beyond to help me get well and I could not be more thankful. It's nice to have providers that actually listen and address your concerns. Nevada Pain Care's staff is very attentive and understanding as well. I appreciate their time and assistance beyond measure.

Prior to seeing Andrew, I was given really useless unhelpful diagnoses. And, I could not get the treatment I desperately needed. No real tests had been done about what I have been experiencing medically. I felt defeated and like I wasn't being taken seriously. Andrew sent me for the proper tests and to the right doctors that not only proved that what I was saying was actually happening, but, this has allowed for me to improve though proper and thorough treatment. Thank you Andrew for your compassion, kindness, and expertise. And, thank you Nevada Pain Care! I have hope now.

Also, I would just like to mention that any time I have been asked who I am seeing for Pain Management here in Southern Nevada, the moment I say Andrew Gephardt, my other doctors have been quite pleased. Andrew and his associates are well-known and respected amongst their colleagues and in the medical community here in Las Vegas. This really puts my mind at ease. I highly recommend this practice. And, again, am grateful. Thank you!|Excellent drs!  They always try to squeeze me in when or if I missed my appointment !I'm never missing another appointment b/c I cannot risk it! Great PA's also.
Nicest, most professional Pain Care Management I have found in all of Las Vegas! Very happy they accepted me.
Dr. Gephardt is amazing as are all of the other Drs. & all of the PA's.
I didn't care for Anastasia at all. Please be aware that EVERYONE else is Polite, Professional & very caring! Finally, a great pain management practice!|I dont not recommend anyone loved ones in pain to this office if you want to be abused by front desk. My Husband was mistreated and not assisted accordingly. On purpose she will emplace false information about arrival so you can be attended two hr later and still not being attended when questioned front desk gets aggressive and doesn't assist instead will argue and will not provide you an office manager. DO NOT BRING your family in pain here.|Andrew and his team over at Nevada Pain Care are truly outstanding in their field. I have dealt with a host of poorer health providers in the past. After my first visit I had a great deal of options presented to me for pain management and within an hour of leaving the office all of the secondary care providers had contacted me to schedule what was necessary in order to receive my treatment. I have never received this type of care from anyone else and I'm truly grateful for what they do.|I had the worst experience with Jill the office manager. I got a call from them asking me to find a specialty pharmacy that will fill my prescription Botox for migraines, I suffer with Cronin migraines. I told the lady I have never had the run around to get the medicine before and that I don't know who to call or what direction to go? I also told her I don't want to be put on a pedestal because I'm the patient and it's not my job. They are lazy pushing their work to be done by sick patients. I asked to speak to the office Manager and was transferred to Jill. I explained Jill what I was told very politely and she started yelling at me that if they want me to do things in their way I should do it? I have never in my life had someone attack me like that, she was beyond rude, unprofessional, the lady needs anger management. Horrible behavior! I asked to speak to an individual above her to voice my abuse from her and let the practice owner know they are losing patience because of awful behavior from management. Next day I got a voicemail that they have discharged me from the clinic. Dear practice owner please have the calls recorded, so you can see how awful patient are being treated. Don't waste your time going to this clinic.|Very good Doctors it just a bit if grind to navigate around their staff.  Some have poor attitudes and some just don't want to go the extra mile and no patience.  Nevertheless, it is hard to let go of Dr. Antflick, he just knows what he is doing. Quite the commute for us but I feel can't find anyone like him.|Everytime I enter the office I'm greeted with a smile, a hello and the paperwork required. Everyone knows my name and if I ever have a problem, the staff either can fix it or will direct me how to. There is normally 10 min wait time between the time you turn in your paperwork and getting called to back to the exam rooms. Everyone & everything is clean & professional. I have never had a pain management doctor who cared as my h as Doc Gephardt has. I drive from Boulder City (just about) to the office every 4 weeks 18 miles 1 way. Yes, the drive is worth it because everyone who works there is polite, well mannered, knowledgeable, professional and work in a timely fashion.

I'm not sure why so many providers leave this office but I'm thankful the owner has managed to keep her there!|I have been to a few different pain management doctors and this office is the nicest, cleanest and most comfortable to have to visit monthly.
But if you can request any Doctor here try and see Shannon Signorino PA-C
I could not be more relived and satisfied to have her as my doctor. I am so Grateful for the help and info she has given me.
I actually look forward to my appointments with her because she actually cares about me and what I go through with pain.
Im A very thankful patient of this place.|I have never done a review for one of my dr's before this. I have also been to many pain management clinics.Our practitioners don't get enough credit or thanks for doing their jobs under the constraints our insurance providers but them in. So ,I just want to say this Shannon Signorino is the person I see there and hands down out of all the people I have dealt with over my many years of pain management she is the ONLY one who has taken the time to explain things to me in detail in a way I can understand so I can better make decisions regarding my health. I commend her for taking the time to be thorough when everyone has such limited time with their patients. She has made me comfortable to ask questions about why I'm having pain and then goes through all the options of what can be done so I can make an educated decision on what I want to do moving forward and together we make a plan. She remembers things from previous appointments and takes copious notes which makes me feel good that in the future we have a detailed report of my progress or lack there of for other dr's or governing boards like SS department. She is.a Great addition to the place and I think she is doing an outstanding job taking care of her patients and manages to get everything done in such a small window of appt times!! I will follow her anywhere! Thanks Shannon for doing such a great job!! It does not go unnoticed|Slow. Backed up. Overwhelmed.
When you call, you will be 20-something in line.. And that can mean you are in line for a voicemail box.. Where no one will call you back.
The coordination with insurance is appallingly slow and if you call they will be unpleasant and rude. It WILL take you 3 months to get care IF you call your insurance for them...

In short, go anywhere but here.|The staff was very polite, and helpful. Dr. Nguyen was very thorough, and, professional, and offered alternative options. I was in, and out in a timely manner. I am very happy with office.|Do not come here under any circumstance if you are young and suffering from debilitating, life-threatening, daily chronic pain. My boyfriend came in today, November 7th 2024, for an appointment with Dr. Dennis Nguyen and was told he is ""too young to be having chronic pain"". My boyfriend informed him he is not only genetically disabled (fibromyalgia, arthritis), but also suffers from CT proven back discs, saitica, chronic nausea, vomiting, and kidney stones. He needs a cane to walk, on the days he can walk at all. His pain affects every aspect of his life to the point it is the only thing he can focus on. His age has absolutely no correlation to his suffering. He has been prescribed dozens upon dozens of medicines, including narcotics, and absolutely none have touched his pain, even via IV. Dr Dennis Nguyen then prescribed him a medication he has ALREADY TRIED, and FAILED for positive results. What an incredibly unprofessional and disgusting remark to make, and complete failure to treat a patient. Anyone with chronic pain, even/especially young people deserve to be taken seriously. You are a pain specialization center, your doctors should act like it. Disgraceful.|Not very impressed so far with this provider. Took almost 3 weeks after my initial appointment just to SUBMIT my authorization to the insurance company with no communication they were that far behind and been another 3 weeks and no update.|I really like my doctor here.

Genuinely cares about her patients and is very thorough. She spends time with her patients has an excellent bedside manner.  She is very responsive when I contact her through the patient portal. I'm glad my friend referred me to her when I moved to Nevada.|She's very thorough and also takes the time to talk to us when we arrive. And and go over everything that we need to talk about. And I like that she is on time. Do not have to wait long when we have an appointment at 2:00. It's usually between 2:00 and 2:20 which is perfectly fine cuz other places they make you wait for hours sometimes.
One complaint I do have is whenever you call you never get answers and you leave messages and you don't get returns. I don't think it's the individual office. I think it's a general office that does that and it's really frustrating when you're sick and you're trying to get a hold of the doctor or you're not getting your medicine and you end up being out of medicine for a week because of it. That's the only complaint I really have. Thank you very much.|Really appreciate the time and effort Dr. Bonnick gives me during our visits.  She obviously cares about my health and you definitely want that in your PCP!|It's unfortunate to have to leave a bad review because my actual practitioner is really awesome. The problem is that it has become impossible to reach anyone at the Bonanza office via phone with simple questions that should not require an appointment. And I have not been able to get responses in any sort of timely manner about very urgent matters regarding necessary prescription and medical equipment.
Their phone tree is set up with a bunch of options that take you nowhere, if I select the option to leave a message for a medical assistant it goes nowhere if I select the option to speak with prior authorization team the voice mailbox is full if I select the option to speak with the specific office the line rings and rings and then just hangs up. Lastly if I select the option to speak with scheduling I do finally reach a human person but the phone tree is set up to forward all calls to an external answering service that has no idea what they're talking about and no ability to contact the office directly apparently.
When I have dealt with the in office staff they are very kind and very helpful but that's not super useful if they are impossible to reach.|Dr. Bonnick is by far one of the Best Drs I've ever had!

Over 4 suboxone. I just got new insurance and unfortunately my old Dr doesn't take my new insurance. I have been taking it for pain instead of pain pills for a while now. I am prescribed 2 a day. Most days that's perfect but sometimes I have a bad day and I take 21/2 good days I may only take 1 a day. I break the strips into 4ths and some days I only take 1. I have been filling a 30 day prescription every 28 days for a while and that has allowed me to pick up all my prescriptions at once and be able to take what I need and never worry about running out especially if the pharmacy has to order them. But here they are not allowing me that by scheduling my appointment every 30 days. I can easily make that work it's just crappy that I won't have that piece of mind here.|12/3/24 Update: Your ph# hasn't worked all day. Please contact me if you get this.

Not caring or helpful in any respect. The kind of place that makes chronic pain patients feel like drug addicts. I have a regimen that I've used for years, it works well, and my records show I have never exhibited drug-seeking or addiction behavior. She tells me on the first visit that she's changing everything. Also, the things she wants to do, I can't afford. Will not be going back. She also told me she heard my old doctor (who's retiring) is not really retiring but being watched by the DEA. So unprofessional. Very disappointed.|Horrible service- scheduled an appointment to see Dr Obi over a month ago - arrive for my appointment and only seen by the nurse (no Dr) they scheduled me for an MRI) and a procedure-! For what exactly? I decline and stated I want to see Dr Obi first and consult with him- I schedule another appointment, I arrive and another Dr comes in and says I need another MRI,  I ask where is Dr Obi? Sorry he's not coming in today. What??!!! I reschedule again and another week goes by - but was promised that Dr OBi would be there. Nope arrived got another MRI and no Dr Obi. Just unbelievable. I've wasted a good month- I'm still in pain and  have not seen Dr Obi yet.
They never answer their phones. They are a mess.

The provider sent the wrong prescription to the pharmacy and after two days of relentless calling and trying to get it sorted, no response. No corrections at pharmacy and closed now!

I notice the owner has responded and said correct us directly. I called non stop and asked for a manager to contact me to complain. No one ever contacted me and i never got an apology.|Dr. here is horrible. She does not listen. And treated me as if I was a drug addict. Stated that she could not give Me any controlled substances.

When he tries to call to confirm his appointments, schedule an appointment or simply ask a question concerning his condition, the phone rings continuously for about a minute and a half and is then cut off.

On 10/27/2023 he called 3 times with no answer and no way to leave a message. His first call was made at 8AM, again at 2:25pm, 2:27pm. He was not given a call back until 3:41pm.

On 10/30/2023- he called at 10:36am, 10:37am, 10:38am. He was unable to leave a message for them and did not receive a  call back until 1:37pm.

On 11/27/2023 he tried calling 5 times at 4:08PM, 4:10pm, 4:11pm, 4:15pm, 4:17pm he called to confirm his appointment for the next day which was scheduled at his previous visit- no one answered and he was unable to leave a message once again.That is when I decided to try calling from my phone and was answered after the 2nd ring.

While on the phone with the front desk he was notified that his appointment had never been scheduled and they would have to ""reschedule"" him.

Based on the business hours that have been posted to the official website office hours are 8am-6pm. I do not understand why his calls are not being answered. I could almost understand if he was calling during a busy time of day BUT for me to have called 1 minute after his last call to the office on 11/27/2023 and my call to be picked up IMMEDIATELY is unacceptable. If your office is so busy that your staff cannot pick up the phone and even just place the patient on a brief hold there should at least be a voicemail box set up for patients who are unable to get through.|Update:2022 Authorizations submitted a Request for Auth with a 4 yr old MRI ensuring the request would be denied, hoping I would pay cash.

On my follow up visit for my last procedure, I asked him if the treatment I had gone through could help get insurance's approval for a breast reduction. The very first thing he said was ""What would your husband say?""

I was taken aback by the blatant sexism but tried to laugh it off. However, he proceeded to keep ranting about how my husband would definitely not be okay if I got a reduction and if his wife ever tried to get a reduction, he would leave her.

I'm just one of Dr. Alexander's patients.  We both suffer from chronic and intense back pain.  If your question was intended for me, I'd recommend 1st call his office and ask if they take your insurance.  Depending on your insurance plan, you might need your GP to fax Alexander's office a referral for you.  If all goes well, schedule your 1st appointment with Dr. Alexander ASAP.  Bring any old MRIs and / or report printouts that you may have. (They may prove to be helpful).

Dr. Alexander will possibly need an updated MRI to see where the issue(s) are and to treat your condition effectively.  

Dr. Alexander and I are in the process of eliminating/reducing pain that radiates down my arm. Today, we're doing a nerve block injection to be certain we've identified the exact problem area.  If so, then we will do the steroid injection that will last longer.  Depending on how long that lasts, we may schedule an RFA.

They have really nice office space.Very calming and relaxing.The wait time was minimal, and the check-in process was really smooth. I saw Dr Schlinger and she was punctual and efficient, making the most of our very first appointment (either though her new laptop  did not want to cooperate )
I was impressed with Dr. Schlinger's expertise and knowledge regarding  my conditions. She took the time to discuss a lot of things and explained possible treatment options and helped me feel confident in my decision to come again and see if I can be helped.|Dr. Hall and his entire staff are truly amazing! The minute you walk into the office you are greeted with friendly, caring staff and a very relaxing atmosphere. Once you meet Dr. Hall
you feel totally at ease. He takes the time to thoroughly explain the procedure you need to have and why you need it. He is extremely knowledgeable and very caring. I would highly recommend Relevium Pain Specialists!|Title: Mixed Experience

My daughter was referred to Relevium Pain Specialist by her lawyer, although her case was eventually withdrawn. I contacted the clinic directly to discuss a discount due to her limited number of visits--just three in total.

The sessions with the pain specialist and psychologist were brief, yet we were charged for longer durations. Despite expressing my concerns, initial assistance from Supervisor Jessica was limited, and subsequent communication left me feeling dissatisfied.

However, a year later, during an in-person visit, I had the opportunity to speak with the owner, who displayed kindness and a willingness to address my grievances.

Overall, while I appreciate the owner's assistance, the high costs and lack of professionalism from the supervisor warrant a four-star review.|I have been a patient of Dr. Hall's since August 2017. As evidenced by other reviewers, Dr. Hall is an outstanding physician. I have been provided with such dedicated and compassionate care. Dr Hall Is very bright and is able to convey treatment options and outcomes in a way that is easily understood. He listens to and answers my questions and I never feel rushed during my appointments. I trust Dr. Hall implicitly and I am so grateful for him. HIs staff is courteous and they are very efficient with submitting prescriptions and appointment referrals. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Hall and his office staff!|I saw Dr. Hall today for low back pain from pregnancy and age. He is very knowledgeable, caring, and thorough. After only 1 visit, he already has a plan of treatment for me. I suffer from anxiety and I left very confident and at ease about him giving me back my quality of life! Definitely the place to go for answers!|I treated with Relevium for my Auto Accident and they are truly the best!  They helped me get the care I needed after my tragic accident.  I was very well taken care of. They are very flexible and easy to deal with. Everyone was very nice, and it is nice to be treated well since you are the patient in need of help. Caring, smiling and laughing is good atmosphere for patients.  Dr. Hall and his PA's are great! I would give them 100 stars out of 10. Even his front desk gals are awesome ladies. Very professional, helpful and compassionate. I will continue to come here!|Dr. Andrew Hall is an extremely kind & caring human being.

They have negative patient handling capacity. They have too many and not enough people working.
You cannot call each office individually for appointments. You MUST call their main hotline, handled elsewhere or something.
EVERYTHING takes them FOREVER or never happens. They do not care how in pain you are. They are here for the money, not to help their patients.

Today I have called the surgery center 3 times. Each time, I was in line and noticed it ticked down at intervals. Once I got to the front of the queue, I was put straight to Voicemail.. Which they NEVER get back to you.
In short, NO ONE has picked up at surgeries ALL DAY and no one called back.

You will be rushed into their offices then ignored.. New patients they love. They WILL NOT transfer your papers ANYWHERE else. They WILL NOT let you walk in and take your own medical transcripts

Hubby and I are working with a lawyer since we can't get his info and we should have FULL ACCESS.|I was referred to NPC for persistent Neck spasms. My initial visit went very well, and would have rated a 5 star review. However, my follow-up visit has proved difficult, at best. I'm hopeful that this review might prompt some sort of response.

On my follow-up visit, I was told I needed a CT scan, and a pain medication prescription to tide me over until the CT results were ready. Great!

After a week, no referral. I've called now 3 times. Navigating their phone system is an adventure - but I never got to speak to a live person. I've left messages with no response, however to be fair their VM system cannot handle messages over 10 seconds and cut me off.

They don't appear to have a patient portal, so I don't know any other way to contact them. My pharmacy is having the same issue. They won't fill the pain prescription until they contact NPC to verify the prescription. After a week, they have been unable to contact anyone as well.

I've even tried to call and set up / change an appointment. Again, just an eternity on hold and no real person.

This is serious. There is literally no way for me to contact or talk to anyone at NPC.

Taking matters into my own hands, I've done a self pay CT and the results will be ready for evaluation in a few days. I can't even contact anyone at NPC to let them know I don't need the referral anymore.

If you are considering using them, I wish you a better experience.|I like how doctor Leon Perel and his P.A Kevin does their best with limited resources they have.
Until we overhaul our medical systems, doctors hands will be tied in more than one way in how they care for their patients......|Dr Thorn, like the others said he would never prescribe the only medicine that helped. No matter what, no pain meds that actually work. Sent out for tests and referred for different ""treatments"" that I have followed. It's a scam. Pain clinics must be very profitable.

The location of this center is 1st clue.   Be sure to keep your street contacts, easier, cheaper. Med industry total crooks sanctioned by govt. I dream of giving them shots. Lol|This place took a referral from my Dr & spoke to my insurance provider. The day of my initial appointment they refused to see me because I have an attorney & Im collecting a settlement. Despite this being a preexisting condition AND the fact that I haven't had medical treatment through my attorney in a year. They didn't care that I am in pain & waited 3 months for the referral to see them. They just wanted to get paid by my attorney & not a copay from insurance. Greedy jerks! Don't waste your time. No compassion here!!!|Dr. Perel is a great doctor and so is Kevin his side kick. Front office personal are very nice people. BUT... The billing office is not very good with math. My co-pay should have been $60 and I was being charged $100. Billing called me and said I owe them more money. We got into a slight argument and I said I'm not paying it because she rowed me money. In return I was reported to the credit union. Now I have a ding on my credit score.|They ordered a cat scan for me to determine where a spine stimulator could be placed, due to my excessive hardware in my spine. When the results came back it stated that one of my cages has moved. The PA I saw that day said I needed to ""call my surgeon"". I asked the front desk if they were going to order a referral. The girl said yes. It never happened. Over the next 2 months I called twice to request that the referral be sent to my surgeon, and it still never happened.

All providers are really passionate about the care of the patients. I would like to bring a special light to a wonderful provider, Corinne. She is a Nurse Practitioner at the office, who will always take time to explain things for you. I appreciate her attention to detail and care for the individual as a whole.|This place is a joke. $1500 for a consultation and all that was done was questions were asked. Was told they were going to schedule an MRI, they never did. When my lawyer contacted them they claimed to not know who I was. This place was recommended by my chiropractor and even he was surprised by their lack of motion.  Supposed to have a follow up and every time I call to ask about the MRI I get a super rude person on the other side of the phone. Go somewhere else. This place isn't going to help you and they sure aren't going to do it nicely.|Dear colleague of mine reached out about their experience with one of the practical nurses. I would be mindful if someone treats you differently. I would advised to avoid seeing Nurse Practitioner Corinne Canavero as my dear friend who has sickle cell, was racially profiled and referred to as an addict. The prior doctor did not see any issues prescribing such medications, so as a practitioner, why do you think it's okay to assume they are abusing such? Sickle cell can be extremely debilitating. Sounds like some DEI training is much needed here. Shame on you Corinne.|I had questions about my bill and requested a callback to address my concerns. Despite following up several times, I never received a response. My main issue with the billing is that I was never seen by an actual doctor, yet the charges were higher than any medical professional I've consulted before--including general practitioners, orthopedic surgeons, dermatologists, podiatrists, regenerative specialists, and physical therapists, to name a few.

To put it into perspective, I was billed more for this visit than for an X-ray and assessment with an orthopedic surgeon. This is especially perplexing considering all I did was complete what amounted to a glorified questionnaire.

It's disappointing that this facility prioritizes sending payment reminder letters over responding to callback requests and ensuring transparent, fair billing practices. Integrity in billing should be a standard, not an exception.|Corinne was amazing with my mother, she took her step by step on instructions of her medication which was very helpful considering my mother had to start a stronger medication i was worried for her to take. Corinne was very patient and kind with my mother, I'll always appreciate her for it!|As a confirmed ""chicken-bird"" when it comes to needles going in my body I couldn't have been more freaked out to be getting epidurals for my bad back. Turns out I was worried about nothing. Dr. Pitman and his staff couldn't have put me more at ease if they tried. I had a Xanax that was prescribed for me to take prior to my procedure but it really barely did anything for me. Dr. Pitman's staff took my vitals and monitored me closely for the roughly 40 minutes allowed for the pill to reach peak efficacy. Dr. Pitman is super professional, explaining everything he was about to do and describing the sensations that I might feel during the procedure. Literally the ONLY ""pain"" I registered was with the first of the two shots of numbing agent that he prepped me with. A very mild sting, over almost instantaneously, and then we were off to the races. I did not feel any discomfort at all when the steroid injections themselves were done. I was in and out of the exam room in roughly 15 minutes tops. Dr. Pitman and his staff were excellent in monitoring my pain level ( again, next to none!) and they all kept the conversation light and upbeat and as relaxed as you could ever hope for. Dr. Pitman is a magician with those needles and I'm thrilled to know that I can easily tolerate this when they become necessary. My thanks to everyone at Nevada Pain and Spine Specialists!|I switched to different doc waited at least 30 minutes or more last 4 apts, had problems with billing, and ran me out of medication,don't return calls or texts,receptionist yelled at me when I asked how much longer after 35 minutes waiting,docs are ok its all down hill after that, not worth my time ive moved on like I'm sure quite a few others to Gord|I saw Dr. Pittman and Kit yesterday!

Dr. Ali Nairobi, MD is absolutely wonderful at what he does.

I sustained a crush injury which resulted in nerve damage. I underwent a surgical procedure which resulted in my acquiring CRPS. Due to the CRPS, no orthopedic surgeon would touch me. I was living daily with terrible chronic pain which had negatively affected my mood and sleep hygiene. Dr Nairizi and all at RTPA have been absolutely integral to my care. They have all been wonderful advocates to my needs. I underwent nerve blocks along with ablation's and ultimately had spinal cord stimulator surgery. Mind you, it's not a magic wand but truly has made a difference. I have worked in the medical field ( I am a nurse ) my entire professional life and would readily advise for anyone living with any type of chronic pain to consider this procedure and especially with Dr Nairizi as your provider.|The doctors and staff are not only professional but also are extremely kind and considerate, I have had nothing but positive experience with each and every one of them.
I highly recommend this office to anyone experiencing pain associated from either an accident or with difficulties in aging.
I personally have low pain tolerance and the doctors have always allowed for this in keeping me pain free.
Thank you
Mary|I have been seeing Dr.Narizi for 3 years. He has done wonders on my back. I am able to live my life the way I want to now; with being more active with my kids and family. For those who don't know there are other options to treat pain and not just relying on medication to mask the problem and Dr. Narizi can provide that. I truly belive in his work and treatment options. Thanks for making me feel young again!|There is strong science to pain management, of course: but there is also an element of art. Being able to explain the physiological mechanisms of pain is one thing; to have the medical craft and intuition to unravel the complex interplay of causative factors to deliver deeply insightful diagnosis alongside effective immediate treatment and a longer term rehabilitation plan is a whole step up in capability and clinical excellence.

Jason Machado (APRN) at RTPA achieved this combination of potent skills and threw in a charming and considered manner with clear and intelligible communication style.

My treatment for excruciating shoulder and neck pain was a demonstration of clinical competence, physiological awareness and diagnostic intuition. All in all I was extremely impressed - to be honest it was more than I was expecting and the relief from the pain figuratively and literally lifted a massive burden off my shoulders.

I would not hesitate to recommend Jason to anyone with acute pain, but especially where sports injuries / overuse / wearing out situations are at play. Having someone, who understands that (as one gets older) keeping participating in sport is a key priority to any treatment plan, really does matter! I was very gratified and grateful that Jason is the kind of clinician who really gets that concept, no doubt as an active athlete himself.

Overall the facility was excellent in every aspect - professional, yet friendly; responsive and helpful; efficient and simple to deal with.

I am therefore happy to highly recommend Reno Tahoe Pain Associates.|I have been a patient since 2019 and as a retired RN I can not say enough about the professionalism friendliness of this practice!|Again, Dr Nairizi and his staff have been more than AMAZING!  Dr. Nairizi had to replace a permanent tens unit that I received in 2017 because I lost weight and the tens unit did move (this wasn't unexpected if I were to lose weight), but it had slipped over right on top of my spine.  His office was able to get me in rather quickly (I only have Mondays off, so I needed to schedule it for a Monday), they would have gotten me in sooner if not for my work schedule. Dr. Nairizi is the most pleasant man you could ever ask for and extremely good at what he does too!  I mean EXTREMELY GOOD!  His staff, wow, I can't say enough about them!  I experienced what I now know are burns from an external tens unit, which I would not have known unless one of his assistants (I can't remember her name!  I feel so bad!) hadn't worked for a dermatology firm prior, she told me what they were and wrote down what I needed to get to make them better.  I thought they were allergic reactions to something! She is an angel!  And I can't end this review without mentioning Shawnda!  She was at the front desk and I called her for some advice and she was so extremely worried about me (I thought my stitches had come out, turns out I never had stitches, it was just some new fangled butterfly type bandage) anyway, her care and concern for me was over the top!  She was and is, just a wonderful person!

Avoid her at all cost she will not help you. The medication the doctor ordered was not available due to shortages. I called at 8 AM to get a new medication for my elderly mother and Stephanie didn't bother to pass the information to the doctor. My mom called at 10 AM and she put her off as if it wasn't important. I called back at 1:30 and she had me do her job and call different pharmacies to see who had the new medication available. I called her back after I found which pharmacy had it available and she said she would take care of it. At 4:30 mom called back and it still was not handled. Stephanie called at 5:15 and said it was sent to the pharmacy. I called the pharmacy at 6:30 and 8:00 pm to find out when the prescription would be ready. They said we have not received a prescription from your doctor's office. Stephanie lied about the prescription. How could this woman be so cruel to let an elderly woman suffer. To be honest Stephanie should be fired because she makes Dynamic Pain look bad. The doctors are great but if you have an incompetent person on your staff dealing with meds it ruins the respect you have for the whole office.|Both Dr. Imas and Isaac Tunnel are absolutely amazing. As other people have posted, they take the time to listen to you. I never feel rushed but also I'm usually in and out pretty quickly. Sometimes you find Dr's who are willing to listen but then the rest of the patients sit in the waiting room for an hour not the case here.  I've been with both Drs for a while now and they have really helped me and my quality of life. The staff has always very helpful and courteous. The doctors are EXTREMELY knowledgeable and do an amazing job of explaining everything. From meds to what's going on with your body. Highly recommend this establishment to anyone. Unless your dr shopping, this is not the place, they care about their patients and their health and safety/well-being and you as a person.|I've been a patient of doctor Imas for few years now. He is  very knowledgeable,and he explains everything very well. I also wanna thank Krystal Steckel. She's an exceptional doctor as well. And very kind. They always listen to my concerns. And questions I have. They always go  above and beyond. In patient care.They are very kind with us,  patients..Also there stuff are amazing. They always happy to help.  Thank you Dynamic pain rehabilitation for ben part of my life..God Bless you all.|Staffing nice. Dr. Imas is very intelligent in his scope of practice. I totally understood my Plan of care of Physical Therapy and meds. He one of the Best Dr.'s I've been to and I'm an ICU Nurse who has had several back injuries and One surgery that really didn't help much with the pain. I recommend him for anybody in pain or needs Physical Therapy. Dr. Imas is a 5 star plus for me!|Dr. Imas is incredible! He took his time listening to my concerns and sharing options with me. I am so glad that they work to find a solution not just cover your pain with pills. They actually work to give you a better quality of life. I highly recommend this office. The entire staff is great!|Dr. Imas is great. Listens to his patients spending quality time with them and giving detail explanations. Stephanie is awesome. She really advocated for my husband when his mri was being denied.|Dr. Imas is very careful to not overprescribe or overtreat. He likes to solve issues in non-invasive stages initially, then move on to other treatments based upon the initial results. Takes the time to listen.|I love this office! Dr. Imas and his staff has already gone above and beyond for me and I've only been seeing him for about 3 months now. They always answer my questions, make me feel very comfortable and their compassion truly shows!
You never wait at the appointments, the doctors I've seen so far (Dr. Imas and Dr. Lucy) are very easy to talk to and are so very understanding/informative in pain management.
Stephanie behind the desk is so awesome, she went out of her way to help me with my insurance when she didn't have to but she did it anyways. That's what taking care of a customer is all about. She did her job x1000!  I am ecstatic about being a patient here

Dr. Lanzkowski did the majority of my procedures. Since he has grown and gotten more Dr. on staff is service has stayed to the same quality and care as the owner himself. Dr. Alvarado, Dr Abassi have kept the high standard I have come to appreciate. With the exception of Dr. braumgalt. This Dr has no respect for the patients time. He can be running hours behind schedule and his disregard for his tardiness is ignored and he couldn't care less about what you are even being treated for he can't take two seconds to look over my chart before he walks in unless it's to look at you with useless judgement. He is good at procedures but unfortunately he cancels it with horrible bedside manner and his need to tell you how smart he is and all the useless knowledge he has picked up over the years. And lastly but certainly not least Dr. Raddue (sp) the anesthesiologist  is perfect in every way. I can't compliment him enough. Mr Sandman gets his signature recipe of sleepy time like no other Dr can!!! No headaches, no nausea, NO WAKING UP MID SURGERY (yes it has happened to me!) he's just amazing. Next time he goes to Scotland I will reschedule! He has never left me feeling anything but better. He is magic. THANK YOU CENTENNIAL SPINE AND PAIN. from front end service to check out. It's seamless and enjoyable! I used to have severe anxiety and not sleep for days before any procedure. NOT WITH THIS STAFF. I'm calm and excited to having a procedure to help manage my pain. Loyal patient for life. I trust them and highly recommend them.|Dr. B and staff are absolutely thee BEST!!! I went in to see him as a new patient because my insurance changed. I wasn't thrilled about that, but I went anyway. So upon arriving, the nurse took me back, and from that moment, going forward, it has been nothing but the best. I went in needing a right hip replacement, and Dr. B thought otherwise, and I agreed on a stem cell reguvenation. BEST DECISION OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I have nothing but GREAT things to say about Dr. B & staff. They are all AMAZING. Thank you sooooo much, everyone  and oooh can't forget ""Kaiser"" The cutest ever. Lol|My wife had a issue getting her meds at the pharmacy. Called our Dr's office. Spoke with Evelyn at Centennial medical group. Back office and she made sure my wife got her meds in a timely mannor. Friendly, professional and great great personality. She treats you like family. A great addition to the care team. Excellent.|Friendly staff and good doctors, but unfortunately, that's where it ends.
I had an appointment for a pain management shot that was scheduled WEEKS in advance. I'd requested for Centennial Spine to coordinate with my surgeon so that they'd work together on my case and be in accordance. Apparently, that was too much to ask. The day before my procedure, they canceled my appointment due to a lack of communication.
I guess they don't give a hoot about a patients well-being. I bet if they, or their loved ones, were the ones in pain, they'd get their ducks in a row.
I am thoroughly disappointed and disgusted.|This practice doesn't deserve a one star, in my opinion. I've been patient for a long time, despite the fact that none of the treatments were able to relieve my pain and ultimately caused irreversible nerve damage to my skin. I've talked to three different physicians there, and it appears that when they take over from another doctor, they don't even bring up the patient's problem. There is also disorder in the office. The referral process to another practice was really chaotic and unprofessional, and it took about a month. The referral coordinator took four weeks to provide the referral for my carpal tunnel syndrome, and instead of attaching the EMG test result, she sent the results of my lower back MRI.That is unbelievably annoying and shows a total lack of knowledge.|All very pleasant office. Would recommend highly. The staff was polite, brought me water. During consultation darn it I can't think of his name was very detailed but not being a back specialist myself most was foreign. He said he would go over it as much as I need to completely understand. surgery was not advised but a referral was. So I will see another surgeon then return back to this office. Also signs on walls no meds given on first visit = evaluation which I liked. I didn't go for meds I went to find out what's going on with my lower back and explain my scan.|Have been a patient at Centennial Medical since I moved to the area about 17years. Dr. David Lanzkowsky is a wonderful Doctor, very personable, great bedside manners, as well as some of the other Doctors and Assistants who have worked there.  My latest experience has been with the PA Brandy who is also a wonderful addition. If there is a billing question Sabrina in billing dept. is always on top of it, if she doesn't have the answer she will get back to you with it. I HIGHLY recommend Centennial Medical Group.|So happy with the level of attention and care I have received at Centennial Spine & Pain.

Fortunately, I was referred to LViPC for my treatment.

All the providers and staff I encountered were friendly and professional.
They addressed my concerns and ensured I received proper care for injuries sustained.

Special acknowledgements for Alberto and Griselda who were always very helpful with inquiries and provided follow ups as requested.|It's very rare when I admit that I'm wrong then again it's very rare that I actually am. Well this is one of those times. Went here for a second opinion because the first place I went to was an absolute disaster so I had preconceived notions of how it was going to be. I was completely wrong. They were nothing and I mean nothing like the first place. I have to admit we did get off to a rocky start but that was addressed and corrected immediately. So with my appointment it was absolutely nothing like the first place. they were knowledgeable,friendly, and they listen to my concerns. they give me choices, options, none of this this is what we're going to do thus say the Lord. No going straight for the high dollar treatment and then say well we're going to do surgery next. There was none of that just caring understanding and definitely  what a doctor's office should be. They have that Midwestern values and ethics what you don't see a lot of in Vegas. My conversation with the owner of the clinic was genuine and definitely put my mind at ease. For any of my friends or family that would need a facility like this I would definitely recommend this place. They have definitely earned my trust and faith in them. So if I do have to go up the ladder in treatment options I will be dealing with them and no one else. I had the opportunity to talk briefly with another patient and he highly praised them. Which was nice because the words he used were, they make me feel like family and they truly have my best interest at heart. And after my appointment I understood what he meant by that. My final comment is if you are in an injury and you need pain management go here! do not go anywhere else|Dr. Rosler is one of the most outstanding physicians ever. He takes time to speak with you, listens to you and most of all  he is respectful.
I love the fact that he is not quick to hand out a quick fix like narcotics, he absolutely cares about your well-being and wants to eventually see you get better with whatever the situation may be.
The front staff is very kind and extremely efficient.|2/3 appointments including one procedure had to be cancelled due to the inability of staff to get insurance authorization. The last time,I went in for a nerve block and the office didn't call to authorize until after I had taken off work and was sitting in back awaiting the procedure. They only care about liens and not patients that come in with genuine pain who happen to be coming with insurance.
They wasted my time don't let them waste yours.

I know they are trying to cover their inability to work ahead, but NO ONE shared that there was someone else to speak with, only that maybe they could have the insurance cover me that Friday after already taking the day off from work. It was scheduled TWO WEEKS out specifically so your staff could get insurance authorization. If there was an issue, how about contacting your patient before they arrive in the office? Doctors forget they are there to help their patients, but when a staff is so dysfunctional it only makes things worse. I have asked you stop any further authorizations against my insurance as I have no intention of visiting your office again. Thank you, for your response that did nothing to address the issues your patient faced at the hands of the staff.|I have been a patient for almost two years. Following a back injury from a car accident, I have had quite the road to recovery. Everyone has been incredibly helpful; the front office, scheduling, billing, Physician Assistants, and Doctors have all been wonderful and supportive every single time. I have received beneficial help from Dr. Webb, Dr. Rosler, and Dr. Hall, for a variety of injuries/complications. The doctors have listened to me and then clearly explained to me why I am having the symptoms I was experiencing, as well as their recommendation to resolve those issues and why. Dr. Hall has been my primary physician since he joined the practice, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. He is a master of his specialty and I feel like he has literally given me my life back. (Thank you, Dr. Hall!) If you are struggling with pain, call them today. You will not regret it.|Do not go here if you have a cheap insurance they just look at you and charge you all you got so you wont comeback the asian male doctor and say im good to go back to work and i ask can extend one day he said no i was wondering how he know that my.pain is ok driving home here i go agaian pain on my back and legsn*|I feel very fortunate to have been referred to Dr. Rosler, and this also goes for his administrative & medical teams. After my consultation with Dr. Rosler, my anxiety immediately disappeared. The professionalism, kindness, and over all positive energy that everyone shares within each office, had made my first procedure incredibly pleasant (a lot less scary than I originally feared).
I highly recommend Dr. Rosler, and I'm extremely grateful to have been referred to the VERY BEST!|Getting an appointment for a consultation wasn't an issue. However, I didn't leave feeling exactly comfortable about the recommendation for treatment and how it could benefit me. I was only recommended for the procedure after the doctor decided to due a couple movement tests, he was initially trying to tell me to go see a neurologists to map my nerves. I became even more uncomfortable when I needed to schedule the procedure and was told I would be called and given a time the day before the date I set a month in advance. I was given no information about the procedure or where it would be done. I called the Monday before my scheduled date trying to get more information, make sure the procedure was approved by my insurance and I was pretty much brushed off and she would not give me an appointment time. The representative didn't even want to check on the approval of my insurance until I pressed her to do so. The representative told me the authorization was still pending and she usually doesn't receive approval until the day before. I asked what happens if it is denied, she stated that the appointment would then have to be rescheduled. The possibility of having to go back to my employer and say now I don't need this day off but I am going to have to request another day in hopes this doesn't change, is unacceptable. There is ample time to receive authorization and their practices should be more accommodating to the patients, they should be obtaining authorization prior to scheduling and should be able to set a time at the time of scheduling. Also, I wasn't given any costs this procedure would cost me. I received a call the day before with my appointment with time of 12:30 p.m. Mind you I set this appointment a month in advance, you'd think I would have been the one of the first appointments in the morning. When I asked where I was going, the employee asked, what do you mean? I told her I didn't know where I was supposed to go, back to the office I had my consultation in or a different location. She told me I should have received a pamphlet with all the information I needed. I told her I never received such pamphlet. After stating how odd that was and that I should have received a pamphlet with all the details I needed, she finally provided the location of where I should go and told me no food for 6 hours prior, she said nothing to the fact that I couldn't have water that morning. I've had other more invasive procedures where I was allowed water so I thought nothing of it. Especially since I didn't have any food since dinner the night before and the only thing that kept me from being extremely dizzy with massive stomach cramps was to drink water. If I had known I couldn't have water as well, I would have insisted on an earlier appointment. My last sip of water was at 12 p.m., 30 minutes prior to arriving at the surgery center. When I was finally pulled back over an hour after my appointment, I was honest with staff and when asked if I had any water I told them yes, about 16 oz throughout the morning. They informed me they would have to do the procedure without anesthesia or would have to cancel. The procedure was canceled. I scheduled an entire day off from work and wasted my sick leave to have the procedure canceled because their office staff can't get it together and properly inform their patients. They can't get on the same page with the surgery center staff either as I was told by the surgery center that they would prefer patients have nothing, no food, no liquids, for 8 hours prior to the procedure, not 6. They treat their patients like numbers, no one cared about what had happened. You'd have thought the doctor would have told his staff to check on me once he found out the procedure was canceled but I didn't hear from anyone for 4 business days. And when I did, I was told ""oh sorry, I was out on medical leave"". And then had the nerve to ask if I wanted to reschedule. Completely unacceptable. Don't waste your time with this office, they will waste yours.",2022-08-20|2022-11-17|2019-08-13|2019-10-14|2018-05-14|2024-07-09|2016-11-30|2017-02-22,5|5|5|1|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended","Great Staff that will help with any of your needs.

I was scheduled for a procedure and had called in 3 times , over a week, to discuss a couple things and I never received a call back. (after leaving 3 messages, 2 weeks ago)
I contacted my Ins. company, because I did not hear back from the Dr's office and needed to know if my procedure was authorized and how much my portion would be. (The office had a full month before my scheduled procedure to get it pre - authorized, and told me at the 1st apt., that they would.)
The Ins. company stated they had not received anything from them regarding the procedure. I was contacted by the surgical center for the procedure and I notified them that an authorization had never been sent in, so they were being fired and I would go somewhere else where my health and time is better respected and the staff are willing to communicate.
I DO NOT recommend this place if you want/need communication. They are absolutely awful!!!
I am an RN, and NO ONE should ever be treated this way when they are trying to get healthcare.
I do not know how they even stay in business with the way they treat their patients.
They have been reported to the Ins company I am with and they are contracted with. Hopefully the Ins. company will drop them since they don't seem to care about their patients.|I do not recommend So Nevada Pain Center, they have constant staff changes, dont keep good records on their customer and now the final straw was again they accused me of have illicit drugs in my sytem, but each time I retake the urine test the second time it comes out clean.  Not to mention they lost the sample as well.   I do not appreciate after 15 years to be treated like some lowlife criminal.|Front end receptionist has poor customer service skills.

I wish I can get her name she violated my HIPPA RIGHTS and my civil  rights she need to stop bullying new patients  I pray to God I get her real name I'm going to file a civil rights lawsuit on Veronica. How dare you bully me because of my color. 1 out of 10=1|Dr Kim would not see my wife after several procedures because he felt like he did not receive enough money from her car accident.He just totally cut off her meds and left her in a bad situation.|Let me start by saying Dr Erkulvrawstr is the best. He is kind, compassionate and professional in every way and I hold him in the highest regard. His office staff and PAs , on the other hand, are rude, unsympathetic and have no sense of urgency whatsoever. Today I brought in LOA paperwork to the office. I paid the fee to have the paperwork filled out ($60). After I had my appointment with the PA, I asked them to put July 9 as my return to work date because I can't get the procedure done until June 17. The receptionist tells me that the doctor would fill it out and it would be ready in 10-15 days! When it's ready we'll call you to come and pick it up. I said, pick it up? Aren't you going to fax it for me? She  just shrugged. This is May 9. I told them I need to have the procedure done ASAP. They said that they could not get me in before June 17! Unless someone cancels their appointment. So what should I do? Come and sit in the waiting room all day, every day, hoping someone doesn't show up!? Absolutely absurd! Over the past 6 months- a year, this office staff has become a hair and nails salon! No consideration is given, no empathy, no compassion. Zero. It's as if you are bothering a waitress at IHOP for another cup of coffee. People who go to a pain doctor are often.....wait for it....IN PAIN! Scheduling a procedure that will ease your pain SIX WEEKS from now doesn't seem empathetic! I will no longer recommend this office. I've been a patient for 15 years and go to the office on Desert Inn Rd. Apparently they don't need any more business, because they don't take care of the patients they already have anymore. In the beginning, they were great. You waited a reasonable amount of time, for appointments and procedures. Now you feel like you're getting your tires rotated or ordering pizza. Absolute cold hearted, merciless callous customer service! If not for the good doctor, I would seek out another clinic! If you go there, just be advised, you won't find any empathy or compassion there!|Rude lady at the front desk!  I am unable sit for more than a minute or two, and she gave me a clipboard with several pages. What a struggle! I have trimmers so It was sloppy.  She got irritated that I wrote on the wrong line. It was so obvious that she thought I was an idiot. I asked for a place to rest the clip board on so I could and fill it out and she did not even assist me with that in any way.  Then to Dr . Wilson. He didn't even welcome me when he walked in. First thing out of his mouth was, tell me why you can't have an epidural?!  I told him and he may as well told me I'm a liar.  I have an amazing team of doctors, but he  was a disappointment.|I am a patient on this clinic, I really like the doctor I see. Today ( March 28,.2024)at 10:45 am I went to the office for only a question and the lady at the front desk really ignore me, first she say a question? And I say yes, a. Question, I may have an accent But I do speak english. Then she talk to her co worker and said, can you answer a question to her? It was like a joke. The co worker didnt answer so she send me to sit in not a nice way at all. I really feel I was being discriminated because I am latina and this is the first time after 24 years living in the Country. After 20 minuts I just left. Nobody give one minut of attention. Honestly, the clinic should hire better people, I am always very nice and polite when I talk to others but today this lady make me feel very bad. I am a sick person, and thats what the clinic is for. If you dont like sick people or latinos accents you shouldnt be working with people at a front desk. Its called empathy.

The short stint of prescription opioid deaths in the early 2000's were done by 2008  but the heroin and new fentanyl in the heroin created a crisis for government and addicts. NOT PRESCRIBED PATIENTS!  Lets through everything opioid and call everything a crisis. In moves the greed.  Nevada Pain Management to the rescue.  Instead of a simple prescription we can rehabilitate everyone with injections for 10-20 times as a doctor visit solution. Except this doesn't work for everyone but not in this companies mind.  Greed Wins!!   Avoid this place if you have more than 1 pain issue and they will not ask for your old doctors records.  Less $$$ for them!!  Criminals!|I'm new so it's hard to say what's bad or good but so far so good, I also keep track with every doctor every treatments and tests that I need for both of my knees, they have not Gave me any treatments lately but they are with UMC ORTHOPEDIC so i been getting cortisone injections in my left knee, but pain medications dont work no more..
My primary doctor should be the one Lifting the dosage more, and send referral out she did, but they only gave me another injection they said the meniscus wait more maybe by March than we can run another MRI and to see if its causes more tears lol so I said to him oh ok..
But by than we can see..He said right now it's just one tear so it's not as bad and that you can still be able to feel the normal tingling sharp pain continues as months goes by but I am a stage 4 now and it's already bone on bone but the goal is to provide therapy and pain medications and treatments to stabilize it, but not to have a surgery. I was told I should be eligible for disability claim because this been over a year now..so I'm just Trying the most I can through out the year its very painful  hurts so bad everyday and nights i can't work, i cant stand or walk.|Unfortunately, I have a medical condition that I have to rely on the professionals to help me deal with my chronic pain.  I am thankful for the awesome staff at Comprehensive Pain Center. I would be up a creek without a paddle if not for the expertise and professionalism of their staff. Definitely a 5 stars|If you are in pain and your insurance approves this place, you are better off going to Walgreens and handling it yourself. Not only do they treat you like a junkie or criminal, you get asked if you have any guns or weapons on you the minute you hit the door. Pathetic they do not care about pain management whatsoever. I had a nerve ablation scheduled which I had to have two Branch blocks previous, they booked one in October of 2023 and then they just fell off the map and never booked the second one. Nor did I ever receive the nerve ablation. After calling 4 months later and asking them why I haven't received another appointment to do the second branch block, they said they will call me back after they spoke with the doctor. No return phone call ever. So, I made an appointment to go in and ask them in person and I got the same answer will be calling you within a week or two and we'll schedule the second one. No call. Absolutely flabbergasted I went back to my surgeon and told him it was going on with the pain clinic. He was completely appalled and then referred me to Velazquez pain center. That is a wonderful place.
I highly recommend Velazquez pain center. They scheduled my nerve ablation within 2 weeks and also gave me pain medication in the interim. I was not treated like a criminal I was spoken to like a person with genuine issues. I broke my neck in a motorcycle accident in October of 2022. I've had three neck surgeries and then a fourth one to install hardware. I do have sever pain all day, all night, every day and every night. There's not a minute that goes by that I'm not in pain. For those of you out there who have the same type of issue, I know you understand. My heartfelt advice to you is to avoid this place at all costs. It is a waste of your time, your energy and your precious effort.|The phone system sucks.  On hold for extended periods of time after a surgical procedure.   If you call to make an appointment after waiting on hold for 20 minutes,  I was disconnected.|Previous experience was excellent EXCEPT, procedure resulted in pain relief for 3-4 days and was expected to last ""3-6months""   So attempted calls to the ONE phone number and each of the several Menu options to cancel appointments.   FINALLY got through on ""New Patient"" line and cancelled.  This is NO reflection on the staff in the surgery center - all were very professional!!|I need pain injections in my neck from an accident. I've had them several times with my old doctor (he retired), so I came here in January 2023. I have had to rounds of mapping in my neck, that by the way too over six months to get done because of there scheduling staff! I need a third one that I've been trying to get since Nov. 2023. They get approval from insurance and no one calls to schedule. I've called the office several times after I see my pain doctor (monthly) and he tells me ""oh they'll call you to schedule"" and it never gets done. So I call and it either rings for over an hour or You speak to the new girl Ashley who says ""Let me look and see if everything in order"". Then she says it looks like insurance hasn't sent us anything back, but it's been two months "". Then I tell them I talked to insurance and it was NEVER SENT! Oh we'll resubmit it and call in two weeks. That was 9 weeks ago, again. I call again in July 2024 about an approval they got three months ago that they NEVER CALLED TO SCHEDULE! Tiana says we've called you several times to schedule. No you haven't. I actually have phone bills from Verizon that show EVER SINGLE NUMBER that's called in or out going and your business is NO WHERE ON IT!!! They try to make it look like you're the incompetent one that didn't call back. But they're not smart enough to know that we can prove you've never called or done your jobs. I was told again THEY have to resubmit to my insurance because the approval has expired it'll be two weeks! I can't with these ppl, I'm done. I liked Dr. Carno, he's very good at what he does but if his staff is so incompetent that you can't even see him, what's the point!|My surgeons office sent me to this place for pain injections in my neck.

That was in November 2023... the first red flag was that this clinic said ""don't call us for the procedure, we will call you when the PAR is approved by your insurance"". In February 2024, I got suspicious and called my health insurance to see the status of the par...

This company never submitted it!    Oh, and I called this company, no answer and no calls were returned... my insurance also called on my behalf, and they couldn't get a hold of them either.

I told my surgeons office about the problems at this clinic, they said we only send you to the better pain management clinics, once you have a problem or a complaint at this (pain management) clinic!",2024-09-21|2024-12-08|2024-09-10|2024-05-14|2025-01-31|2024-08-13|2024-07-15|2024-05-26,1|3|5|1|1|3|1|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",82.8|78.8|70.8,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","THEY DONT CARE ABOUT PEOPLES NEEDS,  ALL THEY WANT IS MONEY, THE WORST PLACE I EVER WENT TO..

Dr. Thunder is a breath of fresh air in the pain management arena and I'm so thankful I found him.  He's very easy to talk to and level with in expressing my goals in treatment. I admire his courage and compassion, he does not view his patients as a one size fits all for treatment options. He did an in-dept evaluation on my first visit as well as physical exam. Never had I experienced a provider who specializes in pain management actually sit down with me and discuss my health.

Past experiences were all the same, sit in a room wait 20+ minutes for the doc, ask 4-5 generic questions while never making eye contact, ask if I wanted some steroid shots that only ever put me in more pain then rush out of the room saying ""see ya next month"" and onto the next patient.

Dr. Thunder actually took his time in trying to piece together my unfortunate long standing time-line battling chronic pain. I came to him that first visit shell shocked from my last pain management physician who was unsupportive of the goals I wanted to reach in pain management along with impossible to effectively communicate with.

I was already very excited to meet Dr. Thunder after carefully reviewing his website that offered some insight on his vision for his patients. I can't thank him and everyone else at this practice enough for all their hard work, dedication, compassion and professionalism. Everyone working in this office is awesome.
10 stars!|I can NOT thanks Dr Thunder and his staff enough! I came to him after being emotionally exhausted from my former pain clinic. I was diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon with hip dysplasia! I was sent to the university of Standford with the same poor care I received from the former pain clinic. I tried dr thunders trigger point injections to the ketamine infusions!  Both helped on a minor scale. I knew their was something more to my hip issue! I went to the university of Utah for a 3rd opinion! Upon reviewing my x-rays they determined a hip reconstruction would be necessary. I scheduled surgery. Dr Anderson's(surgeon from Utah) nurse had some concerns about my pain management. Dr Thunder made sure I had enough to tie me through the 8 hour car ride home and after surgery care! My case wasn't cut and dry! Upon opening me my socket was completely shredded and dr Anderson had to do a little more than planned to me! 24 hours after surgery I am resting in my home! More than grateful for Dr. Thunder's and Dr Anderson's teams! If your in pain and frustrated from the same run of the mill pain clinics give Dr Thunder a call! He's so kinda and makes the hardest processes a breeze! I can not thank them enough!|I recommend everyone I know to Dr Thunder for any pain management!! The staff is wonderful and accommodating. They are pleasant to work with, always joyful to see you and very caring. Dr Thunder always listens to your needs and works with your pain management to give you a better quality of life! I would never see anyone else for my pain management. I just love them that much!! I feel very blessed to be a patient to this office! If I could I would give them more than 5 stars.|By far the best medical practice I've ever been to. Dr. Thunder and RN Pearla are hands down, the most caring and knowledgeable professionals in the field. I've got a complex medical history. It's rare to find providers that don't need to google my conditions. Not them! Every issue heard. From cutting edge technology (TMS) to physical therapy, acupuncture and even pelvic floor exercises, they do it all to help people regain quality of life. I've been a patient since 2018. I'd move but I'm afraid I'll never find this level of care anywhere else. Thank you Pearla and Dr. Thunder for always taking so much time with me!|Amazing staff and crew here!!
Been under their care for 6 years and they've never given up on my chronic pain. Always wanting and willing to try new cutting edge treatments.

Trina is the best Manual Therapist as well. Front house staff Michelle and JoAnna are really the greatest. Always friendly and always answering the phone with knowledge and understanding.|I have been going to Thunder Pain Mgmt. for 3 1/2 years. They are a great group of Phyicians and staff. Friendly, caring and knowledgeable. Dr. Thunder and Pearla MacDonald., are by far the most knowledgeable pain med. Doctors I have seen over the last 15 yrs. when my chronic pain began, I highly recommend them. My confidence in both of them goes beyond GREAT...  Fantastic!!!|Dr.Thunder and nurse practitioner Pearla plus the friendly staff helped me immensely through horrific pain for 1.5 years at level 10. I didn't have a correct diagnosis until Dr.Thunder saw me for an hour and he gave me thorough check up with information. It took awhile for his regime to work but I finally got out of bed (praise Jesus) and can walk again! (My pain 2-4) I am now cooking, gardening and even hiking. Dr.Thunder has a holistic approach to pain and is open to learning better techniques for pain management.|I cannot begin to express how grateful o am for Dr Thunder and his amazing staff! Trina, the manual therapist literally changed my life with her magical hands. I've been in chronic pain and on pain meds for 15 years. For the last month I have felt almost zero pain AND Im weaning off of the pain meds. I don't even need them anymore. The staff is extremely professional.

I have been dealing with a WC nightmare since I moved from California.  I was referred to Dr. Gephardt for pain management post disectomy/fusion I had a little over a year ago.

I live in Las Vegas but travel to Reno often for work, I threw my back out right before my flight to Reno. I was in severe pain and wasn't sure how I was going to make it through the week. Cheyanne and James got me in right away and I felt relief the first day. I just had my third treatment and I am feeling 90% better. Not only did they help me recover quickly but they gave me the tools and knowledge I needed to continue healing. I will be coming to see Cheyanne every time I am in Reno from now on. If your struggling with pain don't hesitate to come to Nevada Laser Pain Relief, what they are offering the world is life changing. Thank you again for taking care of me!|After years of constant pain from knee replacements not allowing me much needed sleep after using my at home Nevada laser pain reliever treatment faithfully in 7 days I could tell the difference, after 30 days I can sleep through the night without mooning , tossing and putting heating pad on my knees . I would not of believed I could feel so much better after years of pain. The staff has been very helpful with any and all my questions.|They prayed with us. They listened. They immediately acted for what we wanted. They are humble and assisted with corresponding other therapies. You must come here. Whatever you're dealing with. Before you have a surgery or injections or medications.

My verse was Matthew 5:4 where those who mourn will be comforted because we were ready to give up. But God blessed us with James and Cheyenne. Through a series of the 8 shockwave & laser sessions to break up the calcified ribs and scar tissue all over my husbands upper back, we were able to go to our chiropractor and for the first time, he can stand straight. The adjustment held too. A week later, another adjustment and the neck adjustment held too. Laser and vibration therapy with acupuncture has allowed the neck to release as well. 14 years of PTSD caused damage reversed (and holding) in 2.5 months total. Their verse is 2 Corinthians 1:4 where God comforts us in our afflictions so that we can comfort others. And that is exactly what they did for us.

Through their prayers and removing the physical aspects, we are being shown that neurofeedback will be the final component as PTSD and insomnia are the cause and what is halting the complete recession of chronic pain and relaxation of the muscles. We don't see those days of insane pain levels anymore. To see my husband smile, chase our children up the stairs for fun, and have hope like never before, it's priceless! We wouldn't have gotten here without them. God used them to lead him beside still waters. And he will find rest.|I absolutely recommend Dr Cori Lentz for physical therapy and have already referred family and friends to her.

A few months ago I was in an accident where I broke both my shoulders (and dislocated at least one of them).  Three months in and I have almost complete recovery of range of motion and am quickly on the path toward full or possibly better physical strength.  I was fortunate that the doctor/surgeon that I worked with had given me the go-ahead to start PT immediately.  And when I asked about the road to recovery, he told me that I probably wouldn't get 100% back and that the timeline was going to be 9 to 12 months.  Although Cori was cautious to disagree with the doctor, I got the sense that the recovery might not be limited...  Note, she did say that a much of the degree of success will come from what I put into it.  This said, I would not be anywhere near this far without Cori's help.

Cori started with class IV laser therapy, which helped reduce the swelling and the bruising/hematomas, and gave me light exercises with the goal of making sure that the joints wouldn't jam up with scar tissue (my words - not hers).  Fortunately, I did not require surgery.  The next couple weeks showed the bones healing well and at least for the most part in the right shape, and during this time the list of exercises grew, primarily toward the goal toward range of motion - with some strengthening mixed in.  Soon, the exercises were more an equal balance toward the goals of range and strength.  Dry needling was used to help kick-start the strengthening as well as provide some pain relief (I am not sure how that worked - but happily it did) as well as assist toward improved range of motion.  As we continued 'recovering' my capabilities, there were times that I couldn't even fire/trigger the muscle(s) that I was supposed to be using.  Cori would help me find that muscle and then helping me focus on it to bring it back to work.  Throughout all of this, Cori was interjecting 'hacks' / tweaks to make the exercise more appropriate / beneficial for my situation.  Sometimes this would be a simple modification to the exercise, however more broadly speaking, Cori introduced me to blood flow restriction, all of which have been key to me regaining my physical strength.

I consider myself a fairly healthy and fit individual and yet when I began working with Cori for this recovery, I was pretty badly broken.  I am fortunate that I had been referred to Cori to help me get my functionality back.  Although, I am not completely back to where I want to be (noting that in some aspects my goal is to be better than what I was before the accident), I am confident that I will get there and I would not have gotten this far without Cori's help.  I suspect that I am going to be 'kicked out' of her office soon (possibly the reason for the timing of this review) since I sense that I have the tools to complete this recovery on my own (again - thanks to Cori).  This said, I will probably come back in for periodic 'check-ups'.|I'm not sure how to put into words how happy I am with the service I have received, long distance I might add, from Cheyanne and James.  I live 1600 miles away from their clinic, so being able to use their services was not possible. So they guided me in the purchase of my own equipment to use at home. I'm sure I exhausted them with questions, but they were always there to answer with an a short period of time. I received my equipment five days after my order was placed. I have been very satisfied with my own results, including my own mother who is 87 years old and suffering from sciatica and low back pain. After one treatment, she was able to take a car ride for over eight hours and was able to get out of the car as though nothing was wrong. The following morning she woke up and told me she felt like she got out of bed like a 20-year-old . I am so excited to continue down this road towards my own recovery.  I cannot thank them both enough.|James and Cheyanne are amazing.  I am an active, athletic 59-year old.  Previously, I injured both of my rotator cuffs.  Rather than pay thousands of dollars on typical physical therapy, I decided to try Nevada Laser Pain Relief.  After 5 weeks of intense therapy sessions, using Red Light therapy, Laser therapy, Shockwave and PEMF therapy, both of my shoulders feel amazing.   If you are experiencing pain, I highly recommend trying Nevada Laser Pain Relief!!|Im feeling so much better,  not just physically, but mentally as well.
My pain is so much better,  I actually feel like a new woman.  Im 60 and I was in horrible pain and with that comes depression and no energy.  Im back to being my old self again. Thank you James and Cheyenne for all your help and support|I cannot recommend Nevada Laser Pain Relief enough!!
I have suffered with chronic migraine since I was 12 years old. I have tried medicine after medicine, many different treatments from doctors and nothing worked. I had been offered Botox from a doctor and couldn't justify putting that into my body. That was when I started seeking out alternative medicine for my migraines. Getting treatment from James has been life changing for my pain management. Going on a regular basis helps prevent the onset of migraines, and going during peak pain alleviates so much for me. James is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what he does.

The parking lot is big and busy and there's not alot of parking  So leave plenty early for that alone .. And then you're walk in to another monstrous building and then You have to take the elevators to the 4th floor.. Make sure you get there plenty early Especially if you are new because you're gonna have several dozen papers to fill out.. at the front desk I believe her name is Jen. I always liked her I thought she was helpful kind and patient. I could hear her conversations to the patients on the telephone she always tried to help the patients get their medications. She was just kind.  Like most places You' get stuck with A P.A.  And that happens at this clinic too... I like to see a Doctor a medical Doctor. At least the first time.  Most people have big questions And would like to  hear a Doctor talk.  For refills stuff like that a PA is fine... But my experience with the P.A.s  they are scared.  They don't say too much they're very very hesitant to give medication.. So let the medical Doctor set the tone and the PA could follow there lead if it's only refills...|Dr. Andrew is awesome.

But my point is that I don't know how to paint actually address the problem for the people that need it truly truly and there are advocates for their patients there patients. I have Never had an instant with a doctor there that wasn't just genuinely nice and helpful. If you deal with chronic pain I would Absolutely suggest no matter paying care. Their doctors are Great especially since you never really feel judged I judged at least I haven't. All in all I've been with the pain clinic for a few years now and I have had nothing but good things to say about them.|My doctor is very nice and helpful. It is a beautiful office too. I am definitely going back. Just do not be late to your appointments or reschedule because they will discharge you.

I don't know what to say about the staff except they're wonderful...Jennifer makes sure all my referrals were done... it's processed through insurance so I can pay the least amount possible for my recovery while I'm trying to get better after a huge injury

It stopped the sharp, throbbing pain radiating into my head. The pain is back, so I'm planning on seeing him again. He is easy to talk to, and his procedure worked. Thanks Dr. Antflick!|Zero compassion. I am not treated like an individual with a unique case,Im treated with such disrespect .He doesn't listen at all & when i try to advocate for myself he says ""if you dont like it,get the hell out"". He has taken my life from being productive to being a vegetable like he gets off on making me suffer. If you are in UNBEARABLE amounts of pain & injections dont work,Antflick is your worst enemy. Nobody knows my body better than i do & he thinks he can put every pain patient on a ""one size fits all"" dose & think that we will be okay. First day i met him he cut my meds by 60%. Haven't seen him in years & he just cut me again for no reason at all before a major surgery. I call it evil to be honest. People like this should NOT BE WORKING with living  people who need compassion & to be heard. He'd be better off as an autopsy dr so nobody's lives can get ruined by him|The Dr.s & All The Staff Are Absolutely Amazing! They Help & Truly Care With Most Pain Problems that I Know Of! They do Injections in the Office to Outpatients at His Surgery  Centers! I have been going to Dr. Antflick's for over #4 Years & I would  Never want to go Anywhere Else! I've been in #2 Serious Car Accidents & 4 Surgeries! They have NEVER let Me Down & I Recommend Any of the Doctors Here to Anyone!|Terrible experience for my husband. I wish I could leave zero stars. Didn't even go for pain meds, we attempted to get a similar non-invasive procedure that he had previously in a different state for migraines. Office visit was a joke. Antflick stared at his phone throughout the appointment not acknowledging or interacting with any compassion or care. Felt like he was there to get an oil change. We specifically asked for a less invasive procedure and sure enough, got signed up for a procedure putting him under general anesthesia. It didn't even work!!! More money and resources from this scam of an office. The nurses didn't even help him advocate when he said he shouldn't need anesthesia. Surgeon was also a joke. Showed up the next days after the procedure and he didn't remember who my husband was or doing the procedure. He made it a point to reference Antflick's ""hot"" wife and him being on vacation. How unprofessional and distasteful. This was Dr. Gephardt. It was all a terrible and hopeless experience. Seek REAL help elsewhere.|Dr Antflick and his staff are so kind! I've had joint injections from him in the past that were painless and efficient. He really helped me recently when I needed to be referred to a hand specialist and was able to get me seen that day to have a hand surgeon attend to my hand. His staff was very helpful with ordering medications/testing and Dr Antflick made sure I was taken care of during my visit. Thank you so much!|I have never experienced a more compassionate and caring doctor, he takes time to listen to me, he cares about how I am truly feeling and always makes me feel comfortable no matter what situation I am in!!! I would refer any of my family and friends to Dr. Antflick!!!

Name spelled backwards etc...
Then when I get into the office they have literally 30 pages of paper to fill out... It's 2024 nobody is sitting there writing their life story out.. HELLO TECHNOLOGY...
turned around and walked out.... Even in this terrible healthcare City There is better somewhere..|Incompetent staff asking over and over and over to fill out all personal information related to an error on their part. Even after resolving the problem myself, every time I go in they ask for the same info again. When I finally refused to fill out the same forms I filled out thirty days earlier they refused to fulfill a scheduled appointment for follow up on surgery they performed. Even the doctor, Dr. Wilson refused to see me over information I already provided.  Incompetent staff and unprofessional conduct by the doctor. This is a common theme with other patients that I personally observed.

Do your self a favor and avoid this circus.|Had A appointment to day my doctor is no longer there. So I got Dr. Kim . Never in my life have I ever been treated the way I was this morning.  He informed me if I am just coming for pills to go back to my pcp. I have been a patient for 6 years . To they wanted me to book appoint for two month. I ask if I could see a different doctor I have to go threw him. He also told me it was my responsibility to get my records . He said there was no records in my chart .  So bottom line he has no bedside manner. I was crying when I left the office. He has no compassion for the pattience. He also said he is a md . The doctor I saw was a pa and they don't know anything. Well never go back to that office again.|The doctor I saw took me off my medicine I was on at a previous pain management doctor and lowered me to something different, didn't call the day of, and when he did call it in, called it into the an incorrect pharmacy, so I foresee in the future me having trouble filling it.

He's patient,  knowledgeable, and is very careful with pain management. He's conservative and will only prescribe the safest doses.|1st Time, and Only Time, Patient:

Went here with severe low back, neck and right rotator cuff pain. I've been in PM for over last 15 years + a few years in late 90s, so I'm not new to this. Only had 2 PM Doctors in all that time, Dr Batlan and Dr Rosler. Never, ever once abused the prescriptions, went back early for more, lost or sold any meds, shopped Doctors, etc. But do to injuries, forced to take a Disability Retirement in February 2017. Insurance changed from PPO to HMO now. Lousy HPN HMO. Or maybe just the medical group I chose.

Anyways, back to this Quack. Total visit time was 8 minutes, from entering room to leaving. I'm a first time patient to this office. And I was blindsided by his very first question;

Transcript of visit:

Dr Su: SO, YOU ARE HERE TO GET YOUR OPIODS??? (Whaaat???)

Me: No, I'm here for PM. I'm in excruciating pain. But yes, I'm out of pain meds. Have been for a month. But I need something. Some help.

Dr Su: Well I don't write scripts for anyone, I DON'T CARE how bad yours or anyone's pain level is. I'm not jeopardizing my medical license for anybody.

Me: Ahhhhh, ok (wow). So what do you do?

Dr Su: I do injections or freeze the nerves. But I see that you've had those done before and they didn't work.

Me: Well let's try them again. See if anything helps. Maybe the other Doctors, PA's and nurses just didn't know what they were doing or their meds were expired (sarcasm). I don't know why they never worked before but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

Here he performs the most simple exam I've ever seen consisting of Bend to the left, Bend to the right. THAT WAS IT! And his diagnosis, that quickly? ARTHRITIS!! DUH, REALLY??
(But he did not mention the L3-L4-L5 bulging discs, failed fusion of L5-S1 from 2004, fractured C-6 vertebrae from 4 years ago, torn rotator cuff, labrum, bursitis and bone spurs in right shoulder which he never mentioned or examined. Only arthritis).

Dr Su: So before I do anything, this is what I need you to do. I want to be sure that ALL your previous pain meds are out of your system (told him, truthfully, that it's been a month since I had anything except a couple 50mcg patches in that time). And while you're at it, you need to QUIT SMOKING before I'll do any procedure (as if opiod withdrawals weren't bad enough already, let's add nicotine withdrawals into the equation??).

And the clincher?? He says to me, But feel free to come back and see me whenever you feel the need. Goodbye. (Hahaha, never happen)

So, 8 MINUTES, start to finish, for a first time patient.

Did not do a single thing or offer any relief of any type. And he says come back whenever I want? Sure, so he can bill HMO insurance some ungodly amount to do nothing. And collect $70 from me for office visit copay, which I filed a dispute on with my CC company. Lost that too.

I have mentioned this ""Doctor"" to my Primary Care Provider, HMO insurance nurse, referrals dept, etc. All of them said, ""How can he even call himself a PM ""Doctor"" then??"" Beats the hell out of me.

I realize this is a long post but patients need to know not to go to this Quack, OOOPS my bad, I mean ""Doctor"". His license should be taken away for simply calling himself a PM ""Doctor"".

I also realize the entire ""OPIOID"" epidemic has every doctor in the Las Vegas Valley, and America in general, scared sh@#less of the CDC guidelines and the terror tactics of the DEA, but they all need to realize that there are real patients in need.

So now I've been waiting for a 2nd opinion to get approved for over a month and half. Just trying to catch a break. Actually have told doctors that if I was a heroin addict or alcoholic or whatever type addict, or if I had terminal cancer, I would get better treatment than this. Not be cutoff cold turkey of all meds to go through withdrawals by myself.

Anyways, enough of a rant about this ""Doctor"". If I could put less than 1 star, I would. Good luck if you still choose to go here. Your gonna need it.|I was with Innovative Pain Center for over a year, NEVER had a Issue. Same Doctors all the time, no question with my issues., Medical insurance made me move to this clinic. 1 year of service I had enough, musical doctors, fired or left, even one claiming that a Bullet to my head would stop the pain.

Stephanie in the front is sweet, and Azra,the MA, is very professional and efficient. Everybody is pretty nice there. One thing:  if you want to get through by phone, it is almost impossible, but it is not the office's fault! So don't yell at them!|James isn't very talkative. Which is ok. He is caring and kind. He gets to know what your needs are and does what he can to help. The nurses here are top of the game! Always on point and ready! They are busy bees to so it's good to them on point.|Patient care is the least of their concerns. Read till the end.

They won't return phone calls. I've called twice because I never got the text saying my doctor submitted my prescription to the pharmacy like I usually get and I also wanted to be sure that my referral was submitted since it didn't seem anything was done that was discussed at my visit. It always goes to voicemail saying to leave a message and they will call you back, but they never do. I begged and pleaded in the message I left for a return call the second time I called in because otherwise I have to try to drive down there to get the answers and I am in so much pain that's hard to do. Still no return call. It's absolutely inexcusable that they can't return a call to let me know if those two issues were done or not. I shouldn't have to drive down to get answers for my PAIN MANAGMENT when I'm in PAIN and I don't have one of my prescriptions now to help manage it.

Same goes for if your pain management doctor calls you and says they have some questions to ask before they can submit for a procedure so please call them back. There is NO WAY TO DO THAT. I can call and call and call leaving multiple messages with the medical staff and NO ONE will let the doctor know. It's ridiculous. If being able to return your doctors call is important to you, then find another place. If getting a response about your medications is important to you, find another place.

Additionally, James and Dr Kaplan will NOT a listen to you. Women, be prepared to be talked over, your pain dismissed and be gaslit about conversations you had with them. He put in for injections a month goes by I hear nothing I go into ask about it and they said that oh it never required approval and I could've scheduled the injection anytime. But they never bothered to tell me this! Additionally, he said he would put in for a referral to an ankle specialist to deal with my ankle pain, but then on my next appointment, he says that that conversation never happened and he refuses to treat my ankle. It is so exhausting having men in the medical field treat women like they don't matter. Additionally, they REFUSE to treat any pain related to a car accident, they will only treat pain that was caused by yourself because if they treat a car accident they will and I quote ""have to be subpoenaed and they will blow your case""! What kind of a pain management company will refuse to treat pain from a car accident because they know that they are too incompetent to be put on the stand? At the same time I'm being told that I can only get medication from one doctor (them) but what if I go to an ankle specialist or podiatrist and he puts me on a medication for my ankle or broken toe? Yeah, they like to paint you into a corner then lecture you on seeing too many doctors. That was the final straw and I had to leave. Luckily my insurance changed so I have options where as my previous insurance only used this place. Go anywhere else if you have the choice. Anywhere.|If you're okay with getting whatever procedure Jim shoves down your throat without ever having seen or spoken to a doctor about said procedure, then this is the place for you!

Whenever you say no to whatever procedure Jim is pressuring you to get, he interrupts you so that he can berate and belittle you.  He gets mad, irritated, and frustrated when you ask questions and pressures and bullies you when you decline.

Because I could not get any procedures done (due to another, unrelated condition), I was informed that I had to find another provider, NVCPC would no longer continue to refill my meds.  I had been going there for YEARS.  For years, they/Jim refilled my prescription medications every month, with absolutely no problems.

It wasn't until after I had a telemed appointment with Dr. Coppel, who asked Jim why I'd been going there for all those years and never had any procedures done, that Jim all of a sudden started to shove procedures down my throat.  Three or four months later, because I couldn't get any procedures done, I was told I had to leave.|I have been going here for several years.  Not a great experience.  I have numerous serious health problems.  They don't care!  A few months ago, I caught the flu and spent a several days in the hospital.  They would not do a video appointment.  I was discharged from the hospital and had to immediately go to my pain appointment with a fever of 103 and still testing positive for the flu. When I arrived, they told me I could not be there if I was sick.  What? A couple of months later a heart issue was discovered and the only appointment I could get for the echocardiogram was the same day as my pain appointment.  They leave no appointments available for emergencies.  I tried to reschedule and was treated in a condescending and rude manner. At one point she hung up on me.  I was not rude, saying please and thank you, just wouldn't take no for an answer.  They would reschedule but for a week after my pain medication ran out.   Those Pima graduates are really full of themselves.  I found another clinic and made an appointment for the same day.|Very unhappy with the rude behavior of a male PA. I saw him early on & nearly did not return. But have been seeing Leigh til today . I encountered this rude person again. He should not be seeing clients!! I believe his name is James. It's bad enough to have chronic pain - we shouldn't have to endure rude behavior by the staff, as well. I've been going to NCPC for 17 mo.|Friendly , love dr karno and his pa Leigh! They listen and are considerate of people with pain! and there medical staff at Charleston is terrific! I highly recommend them!|Unfortunately, I have to go here for Injections, nerve blocks. Fortunately, the  APRN I see, Darlyn Makunda-Nonato is excellent. Didn't fill this last one to bad, and they are mostly painful.

I have never come across such a professional team in my life for my health. A thousand thanks to all of you you are extremely incredible !!!!!|This place is a Godsend! Everyone here is fantastic. I don't live in Vegas and was on a 14.5 hr road trip and in pain for a week. I called them and asked for an ART session and they had lots of availability and flexibility so that I could plan to stop just as I was passing Vegas.

Bruno was great! The chiropractor also stopped in and met me and helped with the release, so I had 4 hands on me. Very hands on!

Best part , is that it totally relieves my pain and I drove for another 10 hrs and made it home and am still in no pain! I wish they lived closer!|Dr. Petrick is thorough and precise. My pain was at level 8 for the past 3 months. After one visit, my pain level significantly decreased to level 4. After my second visit, I noticed immediate improvement AND the amount of pain I have endured for months is now almost GONE. Dr. Petrick has helped my two kids with their athletic injuries for past 7 + years but this is my first time personally getting help. Biggest regret is waiting so long because I'm so grateful I can take a step without pain again. Thank you to awesome staff in his office and to Dr. Petrick!!|I would highly recommend Dr. Petrick and his team. He is professional and very knowledgeable. Was able to significantly reduce my mother's pain within just a few visits. He is a compassionate and caring person who truly cares about the health and well being of his patients. Office staff is also very courteous and friendly. Scheduling was flexible and easy to get in when needed. Appreciate the care from everyone at Las Vegas Pain Relief Center.|I found Las Vegas Pain Relief Center through a friend after I was having problems with my low back after a back surgery.  I have been a regular patient for over a year and a half now and everyone that works there are great.  They are very professional and very caring!  This group of professionals is second to none!  Today I also had a Cranial Facial Release done and I have been able to breath better all day, cannot wait for my next treatment.  Usually most people feel stress when going to see their DRs, I actually look forward to my visits with DR Petrick and his staff!|I was extremely impressed by Dr. Petrick and his staff. This was my first experience of chiropractic work. He was VERY gentle and knowledgeable. I felt immediate relief of strain and stress. My dear friend has been his client for ten years and insisted he was the best. I have never been more satisfied with the professionalism and therapy that he has provided for me.|What an amazing experience I have every time I visit Dr Petrick!   I've been receiving chiropractic services since 1988.  Not until recent years have I actually felt I was getting proper treatment.  So Dr Petrick is the absolute best doctor I've seen or have been treated by.   His service is second to none.   It's all about muscle manipulation and he is the best.   Stop by and get the power thumb of Dr Petrick to fix you up.  Highly recommended by me to all my friends, family and anyone I know who suffers in pain.  I've been virtually pain free for years until I screw up and crash the mountain bike, take a climbing fall, or just swing the golf club wrong.  And when any of those happen I call make appointment and back to feeling great again!   Dr Petrick can and will make you feel great again.   Get back out and be able to doing the things you love!|I was introduced to Dr. Petrick 5 years ago when I walked into his office with a tennis injury.  The moment I met Dr. Petrick and his staff, I felt welcomed and comfortable and immediately appreciated their genuine concern and attentiveness.  Since my first appointment, I have continued to have complete confidence that any injury the befalls me he can fix, and he does.  Dr. Petrick keeps me healthy and strong and most importantly , on the court!  He truly is an amazing and gifted doctor, and a wonderful and caring individual.  I highly recommend him.",2023-01-19|2022-04-07|2017-09-21|2017-03-23|2017-09-22|2017-09-28|2020-03-05|2017-02-27,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|efficient_service|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJrc7xIgnOyIAREpkABJ94QM8,95

I finally got date(s) and follow-ups for my spinal injections.  After waiting 3 months, partially due to my life issues (my mother's caretaker and my mother both passed away) and partially due to the fact that they had no appointments available at the time I could finally come, I went for my appointment.  I was seated, in my gown and all my belongings in the bag they provide,  and was being triaged for the procedure.  Then I was waiting to get my anesthesia, when I told them ""Remember I can't take ********, I have seizures from it!"" They then told me that they ONLY use that particular anesthesia and recommended I TRY IT or do the injections without anesthesia...neither of which I was going to do.  I told them to forget it and I got dressed and left.  You would think that the PA, when I told her IN THE OFFICE that I couldn't take that particular anesthesia,  would have told me that is all NVCPC used.

I have delt with back and neck pain for 15 years. I have seen so many pain Dr's in many different states and even countries because of my husband being military. Dr. Brady is the best Dr. I have seen in nevada he's the best Dr I have seen period. He is so caring and intelligent. Definitely knows what he's doing and actually cares about making sure to treat your pain. He listens to what you tell him and makes sure you get the treatment you need. Plus his new staff is great. If you want a Dr that knows what they are doing but also listens to you this is the Dr you want. Thank you Dr Brady and staff.|Dr. Dan Brady is new to this location but not new to healing.  He has helped my husband in the past with a knee injury, healing it 100 percent and recently helped heal my shoulder with Prolozone therapy he offers.
I can't recommend him highly enough for all areas of care. Getting an appointment and being seen safely during this time was easy and efficient.|I got into a car accident in September 2021. I ended up with a tear in my wrist. Being a Massage Therapist, my hands/arms are my livelihood. I opted for the PRP shot instead of a steroid. Dr Brady was very professional, knowledgeable and was very attentive to my pain level during/after the shot. I'm very thankful for ProCare Pain & Spine. I 100% recommend Dr Brady.|This is Billie writing this review. I have had steroid injections with Dr Bardy a few times and each time, he has been considerate and understanding of my back issues to relieve the back pains I have had for many years.. Since I also know that Dr. Brady provides the ""natural"" injection for my back pain called PRP. I decided to try that. I had my first PRP injection this past Monday. I had a couple of days of some pain but Dr. Brady said that  would subside and it did. It worked beautifully and i am now pain free! I highly recommend this to anyone to give this treatment a try.  I love that this is not a medication with side effects. It uses your your own blood platelets so that means that you are healing your own body! That makes a whole lot of sense to me. No more steroid injections for me!!!
Billie|New Patient of Dr Brady Been scared of the knee injections due to a Bad experience But Today I got brave due to the pain in my knee and I Tell You I didn't even know that He had the Full Syringe needle in My knee Thank You so much Dr Brady See you Next time.

And his chiropractic skills are top notch. Thank you Dr Brady. Impressive.|Between adjustments and injections, Dr. Brady gave me my life back!  Seriously!  I discovered Dr. Brady this past Fall, after four long years of debilitating pain and no solutions.  I wasn't even able to even grocery shop myself and now, in Spring, I'm working out again!

My neurologist, Dr. Jay Mahajan referred me to Innovative Pain Care Center. I found the front desk personal to be friendly and helpful. I was seen by Dr. Ryan West. I found him to be compassionate and most importantly, he explained what my MRI showed. He evaluated me and then discussed the options available to me. I was impressed how he took the time to explain everything and based on his professional experience, he tells me an injection would be best for me. He informed me the injection unfortunately last three months but depending on the person, it has been known to last longer. He told me because I have Medicare, they prefer to go with an injection and then if necessary, they will pay for surgery but that's only after all other options have been tried. I found Dr. West to be a kind and understanding doctor, but what I found most impressive, he took his time and listened to all of my concerns. I also like his scheduler. She greets you with a smile, asks if you would like anything to drink. She explains everything to you and before you leave, everything in writing is given to you. Overall, while this was my first visit, I was impressed with Dr. West and the entire staff from Innovative Pain Care Center.|This was my first visit. I was very nervous. But everybody from reception to medical assistant they were very kind. Made me feel better. Dr West was awesome, He  listened to my concerns and very sympathetic and understood my pain.

I am grateful to Dr. Wu for finding the real source of my back and hip pain after other doctors for years. I highly recommend Dr. Wu. He is not only a great doctor, but an honorable and ethical person.|Disgraceful Customer Service and Appalling Policies

I've never experienced such a frustrating and infuriating encounter with a business in my life. I recently had an appointment with this company, and they refused to provide the service because I was 10 minutes early, instead of 15. To make matters worse, the company had sent me a reminder text clearly stating I needed to be there 15 minutes early. I work in healthcare and was not able to leave my patients early so that I could provide the best care to them (ironic). I hustled there as soon as I was able to leave the hospital that I work at and was still early for my SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT TIME.

Yet, the staff had the audacity to tell me they require ""new"" patients to arrive 30 minutes early, not 15, despite no prior notice of this absurd policy and the reminder text THAT THEY SENT ME stating that I needed to arrive 15 min early. Mind you no where was it written or even verbally communicated that I would be denied services if not early.... How are patients supposed to keep track of such arbitrary rules when the company can't even communicate consistently? This level of incompetence is not just inconvenient, it's disrespectful.

The company refused to provide any reasonable solution or even apologize for the confusion. Instead, they told me I could reschedule, which is frankly insulting. It's clear this business has zero regard for customer service or patient needs.

If you value your time, money, and dignity, avoid this place at all costs. There are plenty of professional businesses that treat their customers with respect--this one is not one of them. I wish I could rate this place negative stars they don't even deserve one star.|Dr. West and IPCC team were amazing. The front desk staff especiallly Lupe went above and beyond with assisting with scheduling.  Dr. West was thoughtful, kind and took time to explain all I would need to know to be cared for at this practice.

He had me in pain for nearly half a year, and on BS meds for my spinal stenosis that did nothing. He gave me an epidural ""for the pain in your leg"". What pain in my leg? It's in my groin. I was scheduled for a nerve block ""for the pain in your back"". What pain in my back? It's in my groin. He didn't even  think about hip, his PA Lonnie is who ordered the mri.

Dr. Fabito is incredible. I had the chance to talk with him a bit before he did my injections. He was very kind, compassionate , understanding and had a great sense of humor.

I have been coming to this office since July, each visit it is apparent the office is not staffed or trained. Any time I am alone with a doctor or staff they vent how stressed they are with the work environment. It's clear, they don't hide it.

They cannot guarantee the doctor will be on premises to honor scheduled procedure appts, so be prepared to wait a good few hours past your appt time.

They delayed my prior authorization because they didn't know what to do, resulting in it taking a month. I was the middle person getting this process moving along. I had to tell them it was approved, myself. They had no idea. Then they had to ""call me back"". Never have I received a call back from them as promised. Everything I achieved was through my own persistence.

Franco Lee in which I ask for a Anisteolgist
to put me out for the injections. Dr. Lee had successfully did the injections. I was pain free for only one day. So they put me back on
Hydrocodone and asked me to see the Medtronic people to readjust my stimulator
in which I did. The stimulator only takes away
about 30 to 35 percent of the pain away. So they kept me on the pain medication only now they want another lower back exray and
and want me get more injections in my lower
back the problem is that they say my insurance won't cover it and that's a lie. I spent 3 hours there hoping for pain relief and
ended up with nothing. These pain institutions doctors are criminals for not taking care of people who are in extreme pain 24/7. I used to ride motorcycles and
this is how I ended up with 4 degenerative
discs in my lower back. I have more miles on
two wheels than 4 wheels. I was diagnosed with this condition in 2005 and the pain is unbearable as I get older. I'm 70 and in another week I will be 71.

And he would not stick around to answer my questions. This doctor and his lady assistant were very cold and closed off. What kind of Doctor acts like that?? And I had to schedule another appointment. The second appointment I was not even able to have a full injection. 7ccs out of 11ccs and my body began to seize and convulse on the table. When I asked what had happened Dr Odell left the room running scared. After a good 45 seconds of me convulsing on the table My body calmed down and I was not able to speak. I waited 40 mins for Dr Odell to come back and he still wouldn't answer my questions, ran out like a little girl. My speech was slow and slurred.

Everyone is very positive in this office and you are greeted by smiles at each visit. We can't recommend this team enough.|The reception staff at Fabito Anesthesia is the worst. The doctors are fabulous, but the front desk staff, especially the person who does insurance requests, is one of the laziest persons I have had to deal with in a doctor's office. They told me that person who does the insurance requests, has two weeks to complete the insurance request, which is total BS. I waited 3 weeks and she still had not contacted my insurance company. That was not the first time that happened either. That person should be fired for her incompetence.|Anyone who gets fraustrated by the wait to get in, don't lose hope.

I was told that Dr. Hardie doesn't review her referrals' charts until they are in the room.  A GOOD DOCTOR reviews charts BEFORE the patient arrives at their facility so they are PREPARED to treat the patient.  Office staff is rude, didn't offer him any reason for the unreasonable delay and suggested he go elsewhere when I called to bring this to their attention.|DO NOT GO HERE!!!
Don't go here if u expect any sort of quality care. They treat u like a p.o.s change thier story every other day. Have been screwing with my husband's treatment since may. He hasn't been paid since July 6th because they can't fill out paperwork in a timely or correct manner. Don't bill insurance right then expect you to pay exorbitant fees because of their billing errors or get it corrected yourself. and then want to withhold getting your paperwork done so that you can get paid when you haven't been paid because they haven't get the paperwork right. They cancel your appointment, because the doctor never seems to be able to come in,for your treatment can't reschedule you for a month and act like you are the problem. We are contacting a lawyer and looking for a new doctor.  Again do not go here!

Update: 9/11/20 apparently if u leave a bad review for your spouse they discharge you as a patient instead of fixing the problem.... Calling a lawyer now!|I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Dr. Hardie and Dr. Fabito abs the office staff.

My husband suffered for almost a decade with pain in his hip. He saw over 1/2 dozen orthopedics that kept saying it was from his hip (even after a back MRI).  He tried several different types of injections in several areas of his hip with no relief. He could not walk or stand without excruciating pain after a few minutes. Even sitting at times on certain chairs was painful. We declined invites from friends due to his not being able to walk the strip,  go to the museum or even just go on a walk.

Dr. Fabito listened and redid his MRI. He spent a lot of time reviewing his old records and MRIs with us explaining that he disagreed with the other doctors and wanted to do an epidural in his spine. He shared that Dr. Hardie would be able to do his epidural if he could not. The day we picked, Dr. Fabito was not able to do the epidural so Dr. Hardie did. She was great. She took the time to explain to him every step and met with us again after.

It's been a little over two weeks and I cannot say any more than I feel so blessed to have found them. My husband is 90% better and has his life back. We are now going on walks together and he is finally out of pain and off all pain meds.

I cannot thank them enough for everything they and the office has done for him. I got my husband back and can't be more thankful.

The China-Gel topical reliever is a must-use product from The Pain Clinic LV. I've applied this to my achy joints and inflamed muscles along my neck shoulder areas. Let me tell you, the smell is not overpoweringly strong with menthol; just a hint of lavender. Apply just a little amount because it will slowly warm up and do its job! I get much relief after applying to my achy joints and inflamed muscles!

Thank you kindly Dr. Alex for this recommendation! Dr. Alex and Dr. Dollarhide are both so awesome and highly knowledgeable! Staff are all so very helpful, friendly and genuinely love what they do! I appreciate your kindness and amazing work ethics!

They make customers wait hours to see a doctor, even with an appointment   They then take 2-3 days to send your prescription to the pharmacy. They never answer their phone. Please choose another doctor.|I gave this place one star. However, they don't even deserve that they had a NP by the name of Nancy she was awesome! And honestly the only reason i stayed with them as a patient. She had a baby and her contract expired so she wasn't coming back. You think they communicated this to me of course not! Because they knew once I found out that she wasn't coming back I was going to be out of there because the customer is horrible! Absolutely terrible! They have a Hispanic lady NP  her English and so is her bad side manner I went for my follow up for refill and also to see about sergers they been stringing me along to continue to collect money from me and my insurance knowing I need my medication she said she was not going to prescribe me my medication unless I stayed with and not try to go to another physician after they said multiple times they don't have doctors who are well trained or proper equipment to do they surgeries but I'm supposed to stay with them just to get medications smh  how horrible! Safe yourself the headache  you been warned find a different pain management. They fired all the old staff and transferred everyone over from they Sahara location which was horrible as well! They talking about they the dream team I don't see how nothing still gets done all they do is play around in the office no work gets done don't go to this place!|I usually go to the Durango location but was told last minute that I needed to go to the Jones location due to the only doctor available to do my procedure that accepts my insurance. While the medical professionals were nice and checked on me multiple times before, during, and after my procedure - no one explained my procedure to me. The facility looks run down and disorganized with supplies plied everywhere on counters and ledges. I had to ask the front desk personnel 5 times for a medical note for work and this seemed like a difficult task, saying they were out of paper and couldn't mail or email me one for work. They called multiple times to reschedule  and still I had to wait for the doctor to arrive to do my procedure. Not sure if their computer software is out of date in order to issue simple paperwork or organizational practices are not put into place to assist with scheduling appointment issues, but bringing in order to the current chaos is needed.|Dr is more worried about his outfit more than his patients.If a dr has on a $500 pair of shoes,patients are not his top priority.I have been going to the doctors for 20 yrs and I tell he trying to just get rich.|Staff was friendly and quick. Phones are tough but overall a pleasant experience|DO NOT GO HERE. I RECORDED THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR KRISTINA. I was referred here by my obgyn after a failed endometrial ablation causing severe pain sending me to the ER and completely ruined my quality of life. I am a full time athlete and employeed full time which the pain has left me unable to be an athlete and work. I have endometriosis and Adenomyosis and already consistently live in chronic pain for years that I have managed with diet, chiropractic, physical therapy and massage therapy consistently for years which have not been effective in managing the pain from a failed ablation. I came with my husband as a witness and the nice front desk lady let him back with me, then she came back moments later and kicked him out of the room because the doctor wanted to speak to me alone. I immediately got snippy and asked WHY because I have been through this rodeo before (if you live with endometriosis, Adenomyosis, or are even a woman, you know doctors never take women seriously). The doctor came in and I told her why I was here, she immediately gaslit me (told me not to use language like ""kicked out my husband""), and she said she can't prescribe anything on the first visit because I am ""too young""  (okay lady, guess what I'm also too young for hysterectomy which is my other option aside from conservative pain management) (also ""too young"" for endometriosis, Adenomyosis, and a rare seizure disorder that never would have been found if my DAD DIDN'T advocate for me as a minor). I immediately got upset and demanded my husband which she refused to bring back, which I texted my husband to call my dad. The doctor then needed to consult the head doctor about possible injections, and what kind of injections are you planning to give me? What are the side effects of those? You get better insurance kick back from that (definitely)? My husband demanded to come back  as a witness and they refused. The doctor then came back with the manager as witness which is hilarious because the doctor was allowed to have a witness but I was not. HILARIOUS. Thanks to technology though I have the entire conversation with the doctor recorded. She then claimed that I needed to call and get medical records from my obgyn to see if the ablation even happened!!!???? Are you kidding me????? Uhm hello that is your job to request any medical records that YOU need (which should have been done when the appt was scheduled) Not mine (I work in healthcare). I don't know where the providers got their degree at but I would suggest they watch ""below the belt"" on PBS and take a course in pain science, ever heard of neurogenisis, cross and/or peripheral sensization (which is funny because they're supposedly pain doctors)?
In the end, she reluctantly prescribed a short dose of hydrocodone (which will honestly probably last me a few months because I only need it for these passing out pain episodes, shocking, I'm not a freaking drug addict).
Unless this place is illegally peddling out drugs and they treated me that way because they thought I was a possible set up (I'm almost 30 and well put together and look ""perfectly healthy"") since I'm not the typical ""middle aged"" ""low back and hip pain"" patient that they would get. Don't go here.|So I will leave reviews as I go with my experience, first I've called because I have been trying to find a pain management place to take my insurance it's been almost a year, my L4-L5 are pretty messed up is why I need to be seen, but I just broke my collar bone and this dr I have has put in effort to find me a place it was to here. So my nurse said for me to call them right away and she also sent me an email copy of my referral. The person who picked up the phone I'm she was ready to go home i work for a Dr too answering the phones so I get it she basically was saying wait for the call from them, no ma'am I don't have time like that. I'm in a lot of pain I need to be seen so I hung up I'll try again tomorrow. So far 2 stars|I would like to know how 6 shots totalling est 42,000.

I was forced to pay $300 plus for them to put wet swab on my leg and ask if I could feel it. And then I was ask if I could fill it more on one leg than the other leg.
They did not listen to me. They did not ask me about my conditions. They had their own agenda and test to do to charge $300 for half hour not to mention what they got from my insurance company that was just my part I had to pay. if I could give them a -10, I would.
If you have a cookie cutter condition, then go to this cookie cutter doctor that your insurance will pay as much as he can get out of them. He doesn't care about you and your condition and your specific needs.
I should've known when he came in the office someone tried to talk to him. He was rude. Also somebody was on the phone unhappy How they were treated was embarrassing. I should've got up and walked out the other way and I would be $300 richer and much would not have to go through that horrible humiliating  experience.
At 65 years old, I am saying he's the worst doctor I've ever gone to in my entire lifetime. Also, he should get in trouble for insurance fraud. Dr's agree to what your insurance deductible after you get a referral sent by your insurance and how they can get away with over charging $300 beyond your insurance. Tells you what kind of doctor he is just out for the money.
Absolutely horrible|Thank you Dr. Sharma for helping my pain conditions. You really took your time with me, gave me a chance to talk after your exam. You gave me hope for a better quality of life! THANK YOU! I will be referring anyone I know at what a good concerned caring Dr you are. Everyone in your office was polite and pleasant and very professional. Dr. Sharma you really deserve my 5 star rating!|Dr Sharma and I have a communication prob, but my nurse practitioner is awesome. Been using Dr Sharma's pain management practice has 2 locations. One is on West Charleston Blvd on the north side of Charleston in the Nevada Bar building, 3100 West Charleston. The second office at 9029 south Pecos Rd. Henderson, NV. The last driveway before the Interstate 215 entrance. Celeste is at the Pecos office.|All I can fairly speak from is my own experience with the staff and that has always been normal. A bit strange at times but as another patient has noted, ' they, Advanced Pain Management Center is where people such as myself who have chronic pain issues go and in some cases for decades, me included.
Why do I say all that?? Reading people's remarks about the staff. Saying the staff did this the staff did that. I don't know 'bout you but I got nothing but thanks and compassion for those who deal with people like me who are suffering. Remember it's not there fault I missed my back up years ago racing dirt bikes. But I have never felt abused or mistreated my them, I have never seen anyone upset other than things out of their control. Insurance and medication. True the world has changed and we are living in the consequential degradation and ramifications of inclusion and tolerance . Sad thing is, that it truly is by choice via apathy. Thank God people are waking up and standing against that same dilemma.|The office is so unprofessional! The doctor, who never provided his name, spent the entire visit on personal calls! I was charged a $75.00 copay, then was advised I couldn't be seen due to my primary doctor didn't send over my X-rays & MRI. While the doctor was on his second personal call I was able to contact my doctors office to obtain those documents needed to be seen. When the doctor came from his second personal call, he informed me that he did not have time to see me and it was my primary doctors fault. The doctor informed me I needed to make another appointment and pay another $75.00 copay. When I requested to see a different doctor on my next visit, he, again didn't provide his name, advised me to make an appointment with a different doctor office and he refused to treat for my pain and would not refund me my copay. This is store front fake doctors office with a doctor that lacks common courtesy and empathy for his patients. This store front clinic is in the business of billing insurance companies and charging patients for copayments without treatment! PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS OFFICE IS A SCAM!!!!!|WARNING: Dr. Sharma was in such a hurry with my mother that he started administering the injections BEFORE the Anesthesia had time to put her under.  My mother said it was the worst pain she had ever felt and it ran all the way down to her toes when inserted the needle.  He doesn't even speak to you before he starts and is in a hurry to get to the next patient in line.  Worst experience ever and never went back.   They never answer the phone or call you back.  2 thumbs down!
NEVADA COMPREHENSIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE.|Dr sharma great. Staff has not answered the phone at either number.  I have left my name and phone number saying I need knee xr@ys for appointment with Dr Sharma on November 29 th.  Dr Sharma needs knee X-rays. The staff won't answer phone, follow up to patient,nor send a referral to Southwest. Medical center so I can go in for X-rays.  This is normal practice and it's so unfair to the wonderful Doctors in the practice.

And high five and low high 5 and do some roll with their eyes and sit down..like the Twlight zone  I thought I was on a hidden camera show, not sure why they don't answer their phones or respond to their patients that are paying For service... There's a lot of pain doctors in The Valley there is nobody in the right mind that would return to this facility more than once. To make matters worse the receptionist cut the cheese and it was a powerful spoiled fart that for 40 minutes I had to smell her butt I finally put a mask on..

Dr. Witmer cares enough to ascertain exactly where my pain is and then gives me relief that lasts for 6 months or more.

The staff and management have been wonderful. I am always greeted with a smile and a friendly voice. I feel like I am making some positive progress and I owe it all to them. Many thanks to everyone involved in my care.

Steve Bell|I used to be paralyzed from the waist down from an injury that ocurred in 1989. I recovered slowly, but was able to walk again with only partial paralysis in my right leg. Then I had an accident on horseback that shattered a vertebra in the middle of my spine and had to have a spinal fusion. A few years after that I was in a car accident and fractured my neck in 3 places and had to have a 4 level cervical fusion. As if that wasn't enough, I fell in a hole and snapped my right knee back resulting in severe hyperextension and very little control over my right knee. I recently had a knee replacement and the surgeon made my right leg an inch longer than my left leg. This caused me to experience hip pain and severe spinal scoliosis. I was in tremendous pain and very depressed. I tried to seek help from several different local chiropractors but their adjustments usually ended up causing me more pain and sometimes left me unable to walk for a few days and experiencing migraine headaches. I was feeling even more frustrated and then I attended a seminar by Reno Regenerative Medicine and decided to go in for a consultation. First I met with Brandon the case manager, he was very kind and listened to my long, sad story. He sent me for xrays and had MD Rachel give me an evaluation. She prepared for me several treatment options. Unfortunately I had to choose the cheapest option, but would have preferred the most comprehensive. The office helped me get a loan for what was not covered by my insurance with a reputable credit union. The office paid the interest on the loan and gave me a discount for signing up that day. I am so grateful for this extra assistance. I started treatments immediately, I must say I am completely impressed wirh this office. Even with the cheapest option, my treatments are very comprehensive, including trigger point injections (to loosen spasming muscles), allergy evaluations, flexibility evaluations and muscle strength evaluations, decompression therapy in conjunction with laser treatments to relieve pressure on the spine & reduce inflammation, rehabilitation therapy (includes stretching and muscle strengthening), infrared light therapy, biogenetix supplements, allergy treatments, and of course chiropractic adjustments. Their chiropractors (Dr. Decker & Dr. Wendy) are so gentle, even with all my spinal implants, they are able to treat me without causing me any pain. I was afraid to do decompression therapy because of my spinal implants, but it has worked out great. After my first day of treatments all the pain I was experiencing disappeared. I am halfway thru my treatments and I am doing great, no more hip pain. I am nervous for when my treatments stop because there is no reversing the damage done by the knee surgeon, my legs will remain uneven. Thank god for this office and the progressive treatments they offer, my only other alternative would be pain medicine. Because of them I get drug free pain relief. They have a very knowledgeable staff from the awesome techs in rehab and decompression therapy (thank you Christian, Alex, and Laura) to their Nurse Practitioner Brittany, to their MD Dr. Rachel and her Medical Assistant Whitney. Not to mention their outstanding office staff!! If you get treated by them you will be thankful and impressed. I noticed that the only negative reviews to this office were by people who were afraid to get treated and backed out. This is the most progressive treatment center in Reno, I am so happy I found them!!|I've had neuropathy for years. After my visit and treatment, my feet and legs haven't felt better! The staff are AWESOME! Would recommend Reno   Regenenerative to everyone with Neuropathy.|My daughter is a figure skater/volleyball player. Based on the demanding movements of the sport (jumps, spins, and complex landings) can put significant strain on her spine and joints, leading to misalignments and pain. Wendy provides adjustments improving flexibility, balance, and overall performance while preventing injuries; essentially optimizing body mechanics for optimal sports ability.

I cannot say enough good things about our experience. The entire staff is knowledgeable, friendly, thoughtful and accommodating.|OK, then just talk. This is Annarae Luevano and I had an experience an opportunity to go go through a program at Reno regenerative medicine and I felt that that was an experience. I was a little afraid of it first and then I had a very good experience and excellent experience working with the staff to make sure that I was receiving what I needed never left me questioning or saying I don't know why it was there that day or something like that because they help me with my body becoming back for me a more normal active life, and I appreciated that I feel that the expense for the program was very helpful to make sure I could do it. I felt very And know sometimes I didn't wanna come to the actual physical place because we live across town but every time I was so glad I had come.

He recommended a surgical procedure but refused to answer any questions or go into detail about it. His reply was, ""if you have questions you can ask my nurse."" And WALKED OUT THE DOOR AS I WAS TALKING TO HIM!!! He handed me my paperwork and said give this to the nurse. It was my personal file and another 2 patients files as well!

When I went to give it to the front desk to tell them I have someone else's paperwork, I was scolded and told to go sit down and wait my turn to check out! It took another 30 minutes to wait just to check out. The doctor had written my prescription out wrong and it has taken me 2 WEEKS to get ahold of anyone to try and fix it. The nurse assured me she would call it in, but never does!!! Nobody answers the phone, no one will call you back, and if you do get ahold of someone they're incompetent! When I asked her why she keeps telling me she'll call it in and then doesn't she replied, ""the wait on hold was too long for the pharmacy."" Wow.

He listens & explains things clearly & in a way that is easily understood. He has set up a treatment plan that I am excited to start. It would be great to have some pain relief in my lower back. My only disappointment is the bathroom was not clean. So that was concerning. Also, I'm disappointed that I am still in terrible pain 75% of the time. I was really hoping to get this under control so we'll see what the future holds. The office staff is kind, patient & very helpful. All in all I am pleased with Dr. Eze & his staff are super. Hopefully we can get the rest sorted out.|Excellent Doctor, affable, and his staff are all nice and efficient.
I go to the Bonanza office with Kim Nguyen.
She and the front office are all nice  and patient with patients.
I am starting my 10th year at APEX, and though pushing 70 my quality of life is so much better since coming to APEX.|Dr Eze is a great Dr., but some issues need to addressed about getting appointment they leave us on hold for almost an hour then when they answer they hang up especially at the end of the day. Nobody can get a hold of the person for scripts if we had an issue the mailbox is too full to leave a message. It's starting to seem like they show up for a paycheck but refuse to do the work they get paid to do. They make it difficult to get through to anyone.|Dr. easy is a good doctor however his medical staff on the other hand not so much anyway so like every time I visit there there's always an issue every single time I come from my appointment there's always an issue. They never take accountability for their mistakes and they always try to blame you instead of being like you know what we made the mistake like fix it. They don't do that. They don't know how to take accountability but my thing is is how are you? How are you in the medical field, but you constantly are making mistakes like every time I come to the office there's always an issue and if I could, I would find a different doctor But at this point like I've already I need the long-term care so I can't really go anywhere else right now, but it just really sucks and it's an inconvenience to me and then on top of that like their wait time is ridiculous your appointment it will be at 9:30 and you won't get seen until almost 130 if you have a TeleMed appointment at like eight in the morning you won't get called until after one like there's always something with the office like Dr. easy as nice and stuff but at the end of the day like it's just a so unorganized and it's ridiculous and there's a doctor there that doesn't really even know what he's doing like Dr. Tim he knows like he could do stuff that for Dr. easy like on some things like medication changes and stuff, but with Dr. with the other doctor like he doesn't do that and he tells you that you have to see the other doctor so I don't know it's just a lot going on at that office and I just feel like they're unprofessional unorganized and all over the place and they need to get it together because it's an inconvenience to people like me. They have to take time off of work a month and advance to take this disappointment and then to have to come back or sit there and be there all day or when I do reschedule and I have to be there like during my work hours and stuff it takes some hours so then now I gotta rush to work because they didn't do their part and call me when I was supposed to be called so at the end of the day I feel like I just feel a type of way because I feel like they could be more professional and I feel like that they could be more organized and I feel like that they could take accountability for sure this is not my favorite place and I hate coming here. I dread coming into the office. I dreaded anything from this office And if it wasn't for my treatment, I would've been left.|My doctor is the best ,Awesome,caring, and a awesome (Doctor) i've been to several doctors but never like  doctor Ezy that's his name for short. Doctor Ezy is number one in my book I recommend any and everyone too go to dr. Ezy. I've had very,very, bad experiences with other doctors until I start going to my doctor Ezy, the injections I get really work and there's no pain when he injects me, however when I went to a few other doctors I had very,very bad results ,when I was injected in my shoulders I couldn't raise my arm for 6 months and I was in terrible, terrible pain, please you have nothing to lose by seeing doctor Ezy but every thing took gain .

I have two full spinal fusions and my back is having some serious issues!!
Arlo Schenk has offered better advice than my Neurosurgeon at Sutter in Sacramento!
To say I'm INCREDIBLY grateful for Arlo's knowledge, kindness, and care would be an understatement!
I'm ELATED to be in his care!!
His assistantMarlee was also a professional, kind earth angel and the woman at check in was lovely!!
Thank you ALL from the bottom of my heart <3
Mandi Bell-Bhatti|Lee is the worst employee you have and has a very toxic personality.  His phone skills are seriously impaired and just plain out horried. He is abrupt and rude. He over talks the client, talks down to them and Threatening to cancel treatment and teroized me about isurance claims. He is obviously not sufficient to handle calls or has the knowledge how to deescalate your customer.

I will be filing a complaint with the Nevada fair consumers and State board of Insurance, all because how he made me feel and his threatening tone.

If I  treated people like he does, I would be fired from my job.This is a small town and judging by your revie....you are doing just fine, it's a joke. My other Doctor and specialist seem to enjoy me as a client.  Because of him alone, consider yourself ired. It's not me, it's totally you. Take ownership on how you treat people
After all we do pay for your living.|I have been seeing Dr. Vydra for a couple of month now. He has been very polite and listened to all of my concerns and talk to me about each one. Made me very comfortable with all the procedures. Regina the office Mgr. was very helpful working out a payment plan and with my insurance. Great office. Thank you ! 8)  Update Dr. Vydra  worked with me to get the pain under control in my knee the last resort was removing a bone spur in my knee what a relief! Im walking again and doing household work. He prolonged my full knee replacement which I will need to get but just not know!!
Thank you Dr. Vydra!!  8) 8)|Great office in South Reno! Easy to make an appointment, all doctors are very well educated and qualified!! I recently visited the Sparks Blvd. location, nice offices, park at the front door and greeted by the ever lovely Marlee! Arlo was quick to see me and arrange for my pain care. Great office, thank you!|Having 16 surgeries with Spine and Hip replacements. So many issues with my spine and other problems with my body, I was always seeing many surgeons and neurologist doctors.  I was introduced to Sweetwater and Dr Arlo and his assistant Marlee. Having been under his care over a year, with injections and monitoring my medication, decisions with care, it was like coming home to a better knowledge of medical care. I needed more experienced care , which DR Arlo Schenk offered. I so much appreciate his healing, professional care. Thankyou Dr Arlo Schenk and Marlee for everything you've done for me. You make going to the doctor a better experience and I know I'm in good hands with your staff.|My pain management team is exceptional! They listen to me and care about what I'm feeling. I gave 4 stars because the woman at the front desk in the sparks location is extremely rude and acts like taking care of you is a waste of her time. I guess she has better things to do than to help the patient.|Anyone giving this place a low rating should make their way over to Nevada Advanced Pain for some real abuse.

Sweet Water has been amazing and they don't get defensive when you ask tough questions. Dr. Young - Dr. Zollinger - Support staff are all on point with great bedside manner. My 69 year old disabled mother has been thru enough trauma dealing with lousy low level Doctors like patterson at Nevada Advanced Pain. Thank for being the difference in our community.|I didn't even get a chance to schedule my appointment after attempting FIVE times to reach them. Then they send me a letter explaining they've been trying to reach me multiple times. According to my caller ID and voicemail they called once. I called multiple times and never received a call back. I explained this to the ortho in my follow up visit and apparently it's common. After reading the responses to the reviews, I'm thankful I was sent to another place and able to schedule an appointment.

Her pain was manageable, but he made it 10 times worse! Took her to UC Davis and found out what the problem was. She's much better now.   He only cares about the dollar|My mother at 90 years old went to this Dr. The very first thing they wanted was a Urinalysis, knowing she has a very large amount of metal in her spine for a small crack in her vertebrae.  The Dr. Only came in for a moment, never to examine her, just to Shake Hands during the Covid Outbreak !? Did not give her an Epidermal or cortisone injections. Would NOT Take my Animal to this want to be Doctor|Dr. Nairizi is an absolutely phenomenal doctor.

I came to him years ago with chronic lower back pain after a diseconomy and a laminectomy and he placed a permanent tens unit in my back, which the sciatica has completely gone away.  . Amazing to me!

His friendly nature and very personable approach to my care was simply outstanding!

He discussed everything with me and my boyfriend who I allowed in there and allowed Dr. Nairizi to speak to, including the fact that I would literally have a ""box"" showing in my back and really wanted to be certain that not only was I comfortable with this device, but that my boyfriend understood what it all entailed as well.

Obviously, my boyfriend and I decided it was necessary, my boyfriend doesn't care and, unless you're wearing a super tight top, no one else will even know.

My ""battery"" lasts for 10 years and, I must admit, that I was a bit heavier when he performed the procedure, I lost weight (gained it back plus some! ), it did shift some and I am really looking forward to getting this repositioned!  Nothing Dr. Nairizi could have predicted, nor could have I!

He is an absolutely amazing Dr., and, I highly recommend him!

Go and see him, you will not be disappointed!

Looking forward to seeing you soon again Dr. Nairizi!|Dr. Nairizi was recommended for spine injections when my mom was in a lot of pain by her doctor. He was very patient and kind. She was very nervous and he took the time to explain everything to her and eased her anxieties. After the injections she has been pain free for over 6 months now. I would highly recommend Nairizi.|This doctor laughed as he removed staples from the implantation of a DRG stimulator due to  hyperalgesia (pain sensitivity) from CRPS. The post surgical wound opened up and every subq stitch extruded.  I found him to be insensitive and arrogant. I now have and excellent team at Stanford Pain Clinic and a local Stanford trained pain mgmt doctor. I do not recommend Ali Nairizi, MD.

I was a patient when Naiziri was with NV Advanced Pain with Dr Patterson. The Abbott reps were professional and we worked together as an effective team. I had the DRG removed by Dr Patterson

Yes I was a patient of Naiziri|I would never, never recommend Dr. Nairizi.  My pain is in my shoulderblade, not my spine, and I told the nurses and practitioners that.  He obviously didn't listen to them any more than he did me.  I had a Fluoroguide for spine injection, two INJ Peripheral Nerve/BR 9 64640 (whatever that is) and a Triamcinolone Acet injnos J3301???  Nothing was done where I was having the pain and now I'm in worse pain that I have been.  Luckily I have an appointment with a highly recommended person this time!|My experience with Dr. Nairizi's office ended abruptly at the end of 2021 when I was dismissed from his practice for allegedly avoiding requires urine testing. This was a shock to me because I had complied with their requests religiously.  The office employs random testing based on the number you come up with after rolling their dice.  On my last visit, I rolled an 11 and was told by the person taking my vitals that they wouldn't require a sample from me that day.  I then finished up my appt with Kami, a  PA, stopped at the front desk to make a follow up appt with PJ and said goodbye.

An hour later I'm in line at the pharmacy and I get a call from the office manager telling me I ran out before being tested and was no longer a patient and that my prescriptions were cancelled.  To make a strange experience even more strange, nobody at the office will speak with me about this.  I tried Dr. Nairizi and just about everyone on his staff and nobody would speak with me. I am astounded by the lack of professionalism from this office.  In addition to not speaking with me, office staff who witnessed the events did not come forward on my behalf and Dr. Nairizi, contrary to what's on his website, showed a total lack of concern for my health by cutting off all medications immediately. Everyone knows you're supposed to wean off pain meds slowly or risk complications, including seizures and/or stroke.

Most of the staff here are friendly but the office is not patient friendly. They will quickly turn on a patient to cover for staff.  And good luck speaking with Dr. Nairizi.  I don't think he sees any patients for consults or continued care and his staff hm prohibits and patients from access to communicate with the Dr.  He seems more preoccupied taking hundreds of thousands from his preferred medical device companies.  If you become a patient her, rest assured you will be slotted for surgery - either pain pump or spinal stimulator.  Someone's got to pay for all the extra income the doc is manipulating.|I have just seen Dr. Ali Nairizi for lower back pain... I'm so impressed with him and all his staff!

These ladies are so kind and exceptionally professional. Today I had an epidural on the lumbar area.  I feel no pain in my back right now and am so very grateful! Thankyou so much to Dr. Pittman and every kind person that work here.|I suppose everyone has their own experiences:

-I have been seeing Dr.Pittman for about 3 years after my 4 back surgeries. He has always been very professional and genuinely considerate with the pain I have. He has always made me feel comfortable and he confidently hold's conversation.
I see him consistently every 3 months for migraines injections, amongst other procedures. He has never pushed narcotics (nor have I been on them) or any other medications/procedures. And always has made me feel like I have a choice.
-Never once has he been rude or rushed an appointment.

Also,
I speak with Tina every few months and she is so great, nice and friendly when she calls.
-Also Dr. Pitman, his medical assistant is amazing. She makes you feel very welcome and is always in the best mood. Shes so nice. Some of the staff is just a pleasure.|I hurt myself at work and I never solved it, I only asked for a full body exam and I never asked for photos anymore, I spent 18 months with him, I was a lawyer, the lawyer got me another doctor. They wanted to disable me and they didn't solve me for me the He only knows how to put the injections, and of other pains he does not know, with the other doctor times I had very bad experience or attention I already put me|I Just had the worst experience with Dr Pitman and i will not be giving him my business anymore! Not only was he extremely rude, he was also very dis concerned with anything i had to say or felt. He offered a bias and aggressive opinion and just wants to refer me to surgery instead of manage my back pain. I have told him that i do not want to do surgery as i feel that it should be the last resort. I had an epidural which was extremely helpful but it just didn't last long. I feel Dr Pitman is becoming callus when it comes to patient care. HE IS ONLY THERE FOR HIS PAYCHECK AND NOT FOR THE PATIENTS!|I will just say this......the negative comments below about Dr Pittman are not fabrications. I've experienced all of the complaints from others. Don't appreciate his rudeness or lack of attention to detail. Its inexcusable for a practicing physician, to schedule you for surgery, and then the day before, realize he's not licensed or equipped to perform said procedure. Epidurals and trigger point injections are their MO & are a nice $$ stream for them. Sadly they don't work terribly well, so the fall back is pushing narcs. Their billing company is a dumpster fire with way too many billing mistakes being made. In closing choose this Dr. & or practice at your own peril.|Dr. Pitman gave me my life back. It honestly makes me sad seeing some of the other reviews.  Dr. Pitman has been nothing but amazing.   He has never given up on me or my treatment,  even when there were days where I wanted to give up.   I have a progressive nerve condition that caused me to be in and out of a wheelchair.  I felt like I was burning alive or freezing to death.  A simple breeze from someone walking by felt like I was being sand blasted with razor blades.  He may be quiet and sometime a little intimidating when you first meet him but I have learned that it is when he deeply thinking of a treatment plan.  After seeing him for almost 8 years,  my condition is in remission.  I am now able to walk miles at a time, I am learning to hike and most of all, my three teenagers have their mom back! I don't even have words to describe how much he has changed my life!  Thank you.|I happened to like Dr. Pitman.  He has a crisp, extremely Professional Style and I found him like able.  Is he an extremely warm Dr.  maybe not.  Relationships takes time, and I'm willing to take the time.  I've just seen him once.
He is working well, with my Spine Surgeon and has made requests of me which I am going to follow.  The chances of my having to have Spine Surgery again are very high.  I am very frightened, and found Dr. Pitman to have compassion.   I am following ALL of his requests.   I'm from California, and all of this is new to me.  I'm being a patient, patent and I trust him.
I've had the same PCP for 30 years, and the same Pain Management Dr.  for 12 years.  It's difficult to see a Dr. that knows nothing about me.  Time equals a good Dr. patient relationship.
I've had a Laminectomy, that failed, and the 30th of this year; I had a Spinal Fusion and Rod Insertion that only participants fused.  I also have PTSD, due to surviving a Brutal Assault, that happened years ago.
When you first see Dr. Pitman, the chances of you walking out with opiates are slim.  You need to take a test first, and possibly see a Pain Psychologist.  I was in too much pain to urinate or take a blood test.  I have a pathological fear of needles.
If you abide in Cannabis, he will want a current Nevada Medical License.   I've decided I'm lucky to have a board certified Medical Dr. that is an experienced Anesthesiologist that has practiced for many years.
We seek Pain Drs, to get pain relief and I do believe in time, I will be on Pain Management.  I like the staff, and think Dr. Pitman will turn out to be an excellent fit.
I'm 62 years old, the pic is from my High School graduation.|Dr Pitman, and the clinic not only did not help my husband, but for 5 years just fed him pain pills.

They are always considerate and pleasant. Most recently, Dr. Kraft and his staff helped me tremendously. They went ""above and beyond"" to help me with the ongoing intermittent shortage of opioids.

The Walgreens Chief Pharmacist unexpectedly did not receive his weekly shipment of 10 mg. Hydrocodone which I have been taking daily for the past 13 years for a very bad back with severe chronic pain that is only totally controlled with 10 mg. Hydrocodone.

The morning of the day my prescription was to be filled the pharmacist told me to come to the pharmacy after 4pm when his weekly shipment of narcotics would arrive. At 5pm when I went to Walgreens the pharmacist told me that no 10mg. Hydrocodone was shipped to his pharmacy. He told me that 7.5 mg. Hydrocodone did arrive and that if Dr. Kraft would send him a new prescription for that lower dose that he would be able to provide that strength to me. Like Dr. Kraft the pharmacist went out of his way to help me.

I was able to call Dr. Kraft's office and few past 5pm and the staff at his office went out of their way to contact Dr. Kraft at home after hours. Dr. Kraft was incredible. From his home that evening, he sent a new prescription to Walgreens which I picked up the next morning. Wow. What great and extraordinary service from Dr. Kraft to get me my medicine. I am 72 years old and a retired pharmacist and I realize how much extra work Dr. Kraft, his office staff and the Walgreens pharmacist did to help me. Also, I have rarely received such incredible service from a physician, his staff and the pharmacist. I cannot thank all of them enough, especially Dr. Kraft and his office staff. Thank you all VERY much. You are all amazing.|I Been With Dr Leon For 2 Yrs And I Can Say Him And His Staff Are Great...This Is One Doctor I Trust With My Health..

Not the Dr but his staff. So I guess on that end it's also on the Dr. Had injections, was also given a 1 week prescription to hold-over while waiting for the procedure. Injections didn't take, did a follow-up phone apt scheduled for 8:45am, actual call 3:17pm. Dr said another round of injections needed and another week prescription. His office would call me in 2 days maximum to scheduled. Waited 3, called on the forth, left a message. I called 3 more times over the course of 19 days, with no response. Finally got a call back, but by this time I had a trip that had to be taken coming up in the next 2 weeks that couldn't be postponed or canceled.  Scheduled the appointment and asked since I would by flying 6 hours and driving back 12+ hours would the Dr write another prescription for the trip, seeing as I was getting hold overs for a week's time and sitting straight up triggered the pain the most. Keep in mind at this point, I hadn't had any for 2 weeks, was back to feeling how I felt before, but really just needed it for the trip. ""You'll have to do a follow-up."" OK when? They wanted to do it AFTER my trip. I said is the Dr even aware of how long it took you to schedule me in the first place? No answer. Scheduled both procedure and follow-up. Trip was moved up a week. Now I call to reschedule, no answer. Left message, no reply. This goes on for 4 days. Go to the office, we'll office is closed on Tuesdays, (and weekends.) According to the phone can do walk-ins. Come back Wednesday to see a note that the office will be closed Wednesday and Thursday. I leave Thursday 6am. Call again to ask if the Dr has even been MADE AWARE of my situation and asked. ""We'll get back to you."" Thus office staff is joke and completely incompetent. I understand seekers and junkies but when you Dr gives you a prognosis and a plan and it's gets interfered with by the staff and you can't even message him, then you need to find a new office.|2 Stars: Great Doctor, Toxic Office Staff

I'm giving two stars because I truly love my doctor, but the office staff is extremely toxic. I called the office two or three times, leaving messages for someone to call me back because I was almost out of my medication. When I finally got through, I explained to the person who answered, ""No one ever called me to set up an appointment."" Her response? ""Okay, do you want to schedule an appointment?"" What happened to customer service? Aren't doctors providing a service like the rest of us?

Sensing that I wasn't going to get anywhere, I asked to speak to the office manager. When she answered, it was obvious they had already shared notes before taking the call--she was defensive from the start. As I calmly tried to explain my situation, she continually spoke over me and raised her voice. When I raised my voice to be heard, she told me to lower mine. That's when I realized I wasn't dealing with someone rational or professional. I never even got the chance to fully express my concerns. I asked to speak to the doctor, and that's how the call ended--no solution and a waste of time.

To make matters worse, when I called back to confirm their walk-in hours (which are listed on their answering service), they told me there were no walk-in hours and forced me to schedule an appointment--for a week later. Now I'm out of my medication. I can't believe how I was treated. My primary care physician was shocked and is stepping in to fill my prescription and help me find a new doctor.

It's really a shame. He's an amazing doctor, but the office staff's behavior makes it impossible to continue being a patient there.

This version keeps your frustration clear while maintaining a professional tone. Let me know if you'd like any changes!|Called 4 times and never got a call back.

I was a patient for 10years here because insurance wouldn't let me switch... Sharma is rude and arrogant.. he has never asked how I felt or really even talked to me ... cut my meds down when he first met me , without explanation... and I never felt good after that. Then refused to give me back my old meds , which helped me. I never say ""hate"", but I hate this man.... He treated me like I was a child and I'm 65 years old. Have not been able to sleep right since he changed the meds.. they were the only ones to help my pain and sleep. Do not go here.

Dr. Bantum helped guide me through a scary time in my life after being injured. His diagnostic skills with EMG and interventional skills with cervical epidural got me pain free and back to living my life again. He is a empathetic person and helped me through some tough decisions with surgery vs. conservative care. Can't thank him enough for this!
Jose and Yesenia were always able to get me set up for appointments and were joyful to be around. Something that is so important when your dealing with pain. The office is bright and I love the artwork in all the rooms. These guys are the best and I refer to them all the time for people that need physiatry. Thanks y'all!|Dr. Andrea Tatro is the best doctor I have ever been to. She is very thorough and listens to what I have to say as a patient she understands I know my body best. She has helped me find out I had severe arthritis in my hips and shoulders while other doctors wouldn't listen to me and tell me I was too young. After her listening to me and 4 years later I had both hips and shoulders replaced. She helps me with my back and neck to try to avoid surgery and try to keep my pain at a minimum. I truly love her and she knows her stuff. I highly recommend!|If you need an office who treats you like a real human then this is your place.

I loved my few visits to Mountain West Sport & Spine because:
1. From Dr Christopher Twombly and his assistant, to the receptionist and the scheduling and office staff I had nothing but efficient, kind and fun experiences. They are real people!
2. Each appointment was easy to schedule, they accommodated my split shift and I was seen on time for each appointment.
3. Dr Twombly is very knowledgeable and practical in his approach and gave me tremendous confidence that we are doing the right thing.
4. The office decor is professional but shows some staff interests - I loved the colorful drawings of skeletons running, a cross section of a spinal cord in bright colors, the sayings about mountain biking and skiing framed (""A good bicycle well applied will cure anything."") and John Muir's saying (""Of all the paths you take in life make sure a few of them are dirt."").
5. There were smiles and laughs with multiple employees every visit.
Thank you for all you have done for me!|I suffer from sciatica so when I had a severe flare up they were able to get me in within 1 day. The scheduler heard the pain in my voice (I was crying) so she put me on hold and was able to secure an appointment for me the next day. The girls at the front could tell I was uncomfortable so they promptly got me into a room so I can lay down. Dr. Reyher's wait times are a little long but he's worth the wait, he is so sweet and does a thorough evaluation (thus the longer wait times). I'm every pleased with this office and my doctor.|I see Doctor Bantom in this office and have been seeing him for the last 2 years. I have always received the very best cf care. I never feel rush.

I was recommended to this doctor by an ortho surgeon I felt very good about which made me upbeat and hopeful he'd be the same way. I tried to explain the long sordid tale of what I've been through for many years, along with what I would like to do. This doctor seemed so angry, and treated me like I was some kind of drug addict. I was so shocked I wasn't able to say much while there and only just decided to warn folks. If you've had adventures in pain for many years like I have, be prepared if you see this doc. He doesn't do well with people who are intelligent enough know their own bodies, and to speak up about their care. Rather than tell me nicely what I wanted wasn't really possible  he told me I was welcome to shop around to find a doc that would do what I want.

He is wonderful doctor.  The person doing the scheduling is rude and I believe deliberately schedules you wrong.  I missed my appointment because she scheduled me for 3 was instead of the normal 4 weeks.  Never said a word, then when I called she scheduled for 4 weeks so a month without any medication.  After 20 yrs, I'm changing doctors.  Too bad they won't get rid of rude, hateful employees.|My mother came in to this facility for a back injection in a wheelchair from a rehabilitation center due to being in the ICU at the hospital.  And behind the counter was this lady Sally (I use this word lightly) who barely acknowledged my mother (I was on the phone listening to this exchange) who was trying to ask her about the amount she needed to pay for this injection. There was a discrepancy but Sally basically disregarded my mom's concerns about the payment. Once Sally had me on the phone I informed her yet again about the discrepancy and told her that my mother had saw the person that quoted her in the office. Sally was so busy cutting me off that she missed that information. So I had to repeat myself. I was giving her the C.C info and she seemed not to be to catch on to the numbers so every time I would say a set of #'s should cut me off which only caused her to get it wrong.

After a couple of tries she had the nerve to ask me what my problem was. So I proceeded to tell her. Which caused her irritation to which she told me that she was just going to hand me to someone else for payment. And while passing the phone she told the next person that she had had it with me and said some other things I couldn't make out.

When you are part of medical staff or working with a medical facility the staff should be professional, show empathy and sympathy. You have no idea what a patient is going through and or their situation.

Sally was also unwilling to assist or have some help my mom upstairs via the elevator to the surgical center. I was stuck in traffic.

This was very poor treat by Sally. Their souls be better treatment at the reception area.|This has been the best pain management center and doctor that I've ever had.  When others didn't care or offered other solutions.  This doctor understood that everyone had different needs. After being in a wheelchair for years I was able to finally put it behind me due to caring, understanding, and treatment.  So for over 15yrs or more this has been the place for me. I recommend to anyone who's in severe or chronic pain.|I've been going for the past 10 years. The very nice, very tentative. I have no problems with them.

There are races disrespectful. Unprofessional First time I went in there. The lady was yelling at me for no. Reason  There's two karens They're on a power trip.

It's not my fault that they are short staffed. They shouldn't take on so many patients if they don't have the staff to adhere to their patients. The person I spoke to on the phone was very rude and told me it was my fault that I missed my appointment and I explain to her it wasn't my fault I had to go out of town for an emergency and I did not miss my appointment I rescheduled it I've been calling every day to see if there is a cancellation and I'm told the same thing also I'm told to go to the emergency room  which is pointless because they will not do anything for me.

It automatically ends your contract and treatment from them. Totally not worth the trouble they provide.|I have had multiple appointment and 3 procedures with Dr. Thomas Zouki.

My first Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injection (ESI) was when I was 18, it was extremely painful and caused my issued to get worse ultimately resulting in surgery to correct. My 2nd ESI was about 10 years ago at a spine center in Southern Maine. Again it was very painful and caused a Vasovagal response. For the first 5 weeks after I received my 2nd injection I had zero relief before it finally kicked in and I had 90% relief. I started having issues again in late 2020 and made an appointment with WDH Center for Pain Management. My first ESI with Dr. Zouki was in February of 2021. I explained my experiences with my previous two shots and Dr. Zouki understood my hesitation and gave me some to help me relax. I felt immediate relief which lasted for 3 months. I returned for a 2nd shot which lasted for 6 months. I just had 3rd shot which again gave immediate relief.  I was never once offered opioids (which I did not want) nor did I ever feel like I was not being heard.

Greatly appreciate you as my pain manager doctor  Respectfully yours Yvonnie G. Roberts|As always Dr Sanchez is the most caring, thorough and compassionate Dr I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. It is because of Dr Sanchez that I am still walking.
5 years ago Dr Sanchez had the awful job of telling me that I would never improve and remain in a wheelchair for life. My friend Manny knew me years before I came to him for help. Because he takes such care with each patient he knew exactly what to say to me. He sat beside me and took my hand and said the magic words ""You Can't"".
After a few days trying to swallow the ""you can't"" I realized I could not accept that pronouncement. I went back to see my friend, my former client and now my Doctor and said the same words back to him. ""I can't"" accept this diagnosis. Manny smiled that Manny smile (if you know him,you know that smile) and said "" I didn't think you could"". We started my recovery right then. Physical therapy a few times and finally a gym membership and he was true to his word. When it hurt too much I saw Dr Sanchez and he lessened the pain enough so I could keep going. It took 2 years of hard, painful work but I am now back doing my job as a Construction Manager, I see Dr Sanchez once a month. His warmth, his commitment to his patients, and his love of what he does has helped me learn a most important lesson. Recovery and a life in chronic pain is 10% medicine and 90% attitude.
I had atrophy in both legs, atrophy in my back and full body Complex Regional Pain Syndrome stage 2. I now work a full time job, hunt & fish as I used to, I hike and take outdoor photographs. I GOT MY LIFE BACK. My belief is this. Pain is pain, yes it hurts BUT...It hurts a lot more if you spend your time focused on it. If you want a life you can have one. You might need to make a few alterations. But you can have a life. If you make that choice Dr Sanchez will help you and guide you to a place you don't think you can go to. Manny, Dr Sanchez, is one of a kind. He will be your care giver, your source of invaluable information and your greatest cheerleader for your recovery. Trust him, respect him, and most of all...let him help you.

The first two pain management providers loaded me up on heavy pain killers making it difficult to function and earn an honest income while raising 3 children and providing for my family.

I met with Dr Geller and we spoke of reducing the opioids to a minimum and doing injections as an alternative, it saved my life and lifestyle as it worked and have continued the treatments for 17 years now. Dr Geller cares about ""you"" not what the book says it pays.

Ketamine infusions have saved my life!!

Writing this is not easy, but if it helps one person, it's worth it.

I was suffering from major depression and PTSD. I tried every medication from A to Z with no relief,  just major side effects. I was at the point that hospitalization was the only safe place.

Then I met Mindy and her team at full life pain and depression center. I was in rough shape at this point and for the first time I could tell someone was actually listening.

On that same day of my appointment with Mindy and her team we decided to start ketamine infusion immediately. I could see the relief on my wife's face knowing I was finally getting some real help. After my 3rd Ketamine infusion I felt an amazing relief and for the first time everything became light and brighter. My thousand pound blanket was removed.

It is a maddening condition to say the least.  Dr. Greenspan was the only pain provider outside of Boston that could perform radiofrequency ablation for this condition.  Even Dartmouth couldn't help me.  Had the procedure done less than  a week ago and I am already off all painkillers.  Dr. Greenspan's technique was amazing!

*UPDATE* Went back to Dr. Greenspan again and he was totally on target and so cordial to speak with after the procedure.  I understand that some patients- including myself- have needed pain medication and that not everything can be cured with a procedure.  That said, Dr. Greenspan does his best to get to the root problem of the pain source without relying on narcotics.  He, like many other physicians and pharmacists, have been put in the middle of the ""war on opioids"" and people who abuse them and innocent chronic pain patients who just want relief.  Clearly there are no simple answers, but I would certainly expect more from the NH Medical Association in terms of carving the right path for both pain patients and doctors.|I have been seen Dr. Greenspan for over 3 years and I just have to say he is fanominal.

He takes his time during each procedure explaining step by step what he is doing. I can't thank him enough for giving me my life back to where ai can at least function on a level of normalcy. His staff is also amazing they are super friendly and really helpful. I highly recommend him and his practice to anyone that is dealing with any sort of pain especially when it is pain that involves the back.|I went to Dr Greenspan after Dr Lehn left , and after many months, of extremely unpleasant encounters, I had to find a different provider. He was arrogant and snide, did not listen to me, and the last MRI that I had told me it looked fine when it had numerous very serious issues on it)) and that is why I ended up leaving. He pushes injections and the stimulator and says pain meds do not help long term. If a doctor makes up their mind about your condition before they enter the room for your appointment there's a problem and the problem is not with you..|Dr Greenspan only cares about making money. Yes he will give you many many medications and get you severely addicted and turn you into something you're not. So if that's what you're looking for he's the doctor for you. He's nothing but a legal drug dealer. He cares nothing about his patients. He will keep you on the meds as long as he can. Even if you od and almost die. You will end up in rehab and most likely lose everything. He will still be rich and you will be either dead or wish you were. So if that's the kind of doctor you're looking for then I recommend him. If that's not what you're looking for then I strongly recommend you don't go to him. He should have his license revoked. I have talked to so many people he has done this to. Including myself. He should not be practicing medicine. Sorry excuse for a medical professional!!!|I am very happy with him.  Where I used to go changed my doctor,  I was very uncomfortable with the new doctor.  When I met Dr. Greenspan,  I knew right away that I liked him, and would want to stay a patient of his.  He is so kind, and has a very soothing way of speaking.   My son has been needing a doctor for quite a while, and does not usually like male doctors,   he ( my son ) has to be on deaths door practically before he will go to a doctor.  I talked him in to going to meet Dr Greenspan, I was pleasantly surprised to hear my son say he liked Dr Greenspan and will continue to go see him.  That says a lot,  for Mario to like a doctor,  a male doctor on top of that speaks volumes as to what a good doctor he is.  It is well worth the 2 hour drive. I feel blessed to have found such a kind and wonderful Doctor.
God bless you doctor Greenspan, and your entire staff.|He's a great doctor, hands down, and the most skillful at spinal injections of any I've seen (and I've seen a LOT!).

I see some complaints from other reviewers, but I can honestly say Dr. Greenspan's only been upset with me when I warranted it. Early on in my treatment a few years back, he took me to task for some of my behaviors...but he was 100% correct. I made the changes needed and he and I now share a solid bond of mutual respect. The man has a keen intellect, plenty of empathy, and an encyclopedic knowledge of his disciplines...but he takes no nonsense. Be sincere, be honest, and be sober and you will not find a better doctor to treat your pain.

I was in a lot of pain and nervous.   I was very comforted by the doctor and his nurse Jenny.   I felt very taken care of and scheduled my  kyphoplasty (sp).   So on  10/15/24, I was greeted warmly, by Sherry, then Jenny took me back and helped me get ready for the procedure while  being a wonderfully caring and competent nurse.   I was introduced to the team and Dr. Usmani came in and we chatted for a bit while he  answered any questions I had.   I was taken in the room, had the procedure and woke up in recovery.    When I stood up the pain was gone!   My husband was brought back to where I was while Jenny helped me get dressed.   Vitals were taken again and they made sure I was fine to leave.
Even though the fall and breaks were not good,  I have to say I'm so glad I was directed to Dr. Usmani and his team!!!!    They were wonderful!!!!|Yet another doctor that keeps you waiting.

Dr Chris (he said to call him that) is my ""5th opinion"" Pain Specialist. I have been dealing with a rare ""unknown"" debilitating condition and nerve damage for the past 3 years.

I actually feel like I can trust him. I feel he completely pinpointed what is going on with one of my ailments within his wheelhouse, and the ""other medical mystery"" he pointed me in the right direction and gave me a glimmer of hope! It has bee a long hard road. Thank you Dr Chis. I hope moving forward will be as excellent.

He told me my spine was twisting because of spinal muscular atrophy and didn't bother ordering any tests to back up his theory.  He assured me that is what was happening.  I went to a different doctor and got an X-ray and a CT scan and the it showed I had two fractured ribs and my bottom rib became disconnected from the cartilage attached to my sternum.  I now have a protruding rib that causes me a lot of problems. Had I known that's what was going on from the beginning I could have had it heal in place.  The man is too busy to take more patients.

I'm very surprised there hasn't been more lawsuits thrown at him.|I am very displeased at how I was treated at my first appointment with Dr Hsu. He blew into the exam room, commented on my meds that they needed to be completely redone. Ok, I'm all for that and then had me move to show him my range of motion. He spent less than 10 minutes with me.

He then wrote a prescription for me to start taking, but his first medication he wanted me to take I am ALLERGIC to.  All my allergies to medications were in my chart.  The second medication he wanted me to start this week, but I needed an EKG first to make sure that I don't have a heart arrhythmia because this medication can cause them. This doctor wanted to change 3 of my meds AND wean me off of a fourth but never really looked at my chart. Plus these 4 meds were prescribed by 3 different doctors and I wanted to run some of these changes by them BEFORE making global changes to my medications.

When I called to tell New Era Medicine that I was allergic to the medication prescribed, I was told that the doctor would be notified and I would hear back from them. That was 2 weeks ago.  I have cancelled ALL future appointments with him.

Very disappointed with the level of ""care"" I received from Dr. Powen Hsu.|Terrible pain management doctor. I would not recommend him to anyone.

I have personally undergone PRP injections for my hands with Lisa. She is extremely knowledgable, caring and professional. I have Osteoarthritis and highly recommend to anyone experiencing joint pain.|Love this place and the people. Since I started my treatments I have been able to reduce my trips to the chiropractor and I have been able to stop taking my prescription medications. I highly recommend giving this a chance.|This review is long overdue !!!
First and for most my experience has only been professional and clean yet welcoming and relaxed, integrity based, genuine care, clear communication, and my favorite humor and uplifting attitudes to put at ease with any stress on what brought me there.
I have just completed as of last week the 10 sessions of stem therapy/shock wave therapy and I am shocked  at the results.    The 1st one gave me immediate relief from pain to my surprise and this relief has continued.  I have less overall pain in my hip area and I find my movement is more fluid/less stiff in my problem area.
I have been dealing with a hip issue for about 4 years now.  Almost a year ago, I had an MRI done to see what was going on.  Basically it said I needed a hip replacement because at any point it could collapse.
Needless to say I was not able to nor was I going to accept that answer because I'm stubborn lol but because I know how amazing the body is at healing and as an active healthy 50 yrs young person I needed other options.  I had stayed carefully active doing my part, being diligent with self care, exercising, eating well and just overall well being.  I was utilizing many different modalities to keep being able to keep on but I needed to do something more, something different.
I was told about NH Regenerative a couple months ago from someone that had done PRP therapy and was able to avoid shoulder surgery.  I did a little looking into them but when free consultation was the invite it was a no brainer, nothing to loose.  It was a huge weight off of my shoulders because I really didn't know what I was getting into (the costs and commitment and I drive 2 hrs 1 way to go there).
For me it was a must try option.  A minimally invasive way for my body to be given some help and the chance to heal itself, care for itself.....
Regenerate itself !
The thing about these treatments also is they continue to work in the body with the healing effects long after a treatment.
Thank you NH Regenerative Center|I've had a great experience at the New Hampshire Regenerative Center. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and the injections have made my knee feel a lot better! I am optimistic that I'll keep improving and would recommend these treatments to others!|Dr Pratt is only out to get money, I showed him my X-ray on both knees and he said I was the perfect candidate for stem cell. So I gave him over $10,000 for laser, pro and stem cell therapy. Plus i traveled over 30 miles twice a week .I spent money for gas and tolls. If you need knee replacement do the surgery, like I just did. Don't go to New Hampshire regenerative center in Manchester they are a RIPOFF|Initial consultation, very informative. Right on time with the appointment, Dr Pratt presented all of the options, was very upfront with the pricing. There was no pressure to do anything. I will be taking the next steps.|I can't say enough great things about this practice, Dr Pratt and his entire staff!!! I had my first PRP injection in my ankle. I have been in so much pain for close to a year and was barely able to walk at 45 years old. These treatments have saved my life and I now am able to walk and my pain is gone. About a year ago the pain started and continued to get worse. I was at my podiatrist office every two weeks for some trial of treatment that did absolutely nothing.  I had cortisone shots, pain meds, topicals and orthotics. NOTHING was working. My only options were fusing my foot. I found NH Regenerative and scheduled my consult and instead of just being told I had arthritis, turns out I had no cartilage in my ankle.  Dr Pratt was very up front about my treatment plan and made it very clear that everyone one was different and he could not guarantee it would take away my pain. I started treatment right away because once you have surgery, it cannot be reversed. I am still receiving my PT with Taylor as well as my light treatments.  The entire staff has been so AMAZING! They all go out of their way to make sure I am taken care of, I honestly can't thank them enough.  I am so happy I found this treatment and practice , thank you for giving me my quality of life back!!!!|After my first visit to NH Regenerative Center having Stemwave therapy,  I didn't have as much clicking in my knee.

He seems to truly care  about helping me deal with my chronic back pain. At first I was a bit put off by his style, but by the second visit I got a much warmer feeling about him and that he really wanted to help me with managing my pain. We had a good laugh about the fact we we were both wearing denim, and at that point I really understood that he was really on my side. We reviewed my MRI scan together and we discussed options to  alleviate my symptoms so that I could enjoy a more pain free lifestyle. I could not feel any more comfortable with ""Dr. B""|If I could I would give him a zero. I went to him for help with my CRPS which I've had for many years. I also was born with bilateral pes cavus of the feet. The man was quite curt, rather rude,I could not get a word in. He was more interested in my back that does not bother me. Then wanted me to take Lyrica which I explained I cannot take. It's been tried before. He insisted I could still take it. Told me I need an mri of my back? And to return to see his nurse. That was it my appt. It ended so abruptly. He never even noticed I have no pedal pulse, my toes on my right foot are curling under. I couldn't say anything! And by the way Lyrica ended me up in a psych ward due to suicidal thoughts. Where did this man go to school? Is it my mind or does he just treat women like this? Just my thoughts. I will not be going near New Hampshire Nuero Spine Institute or Dr. Batlivala again.|I did not have a good experience. I waited from 11:25am until 12:45pm to see the doctor. My appointment was at 12pm, I was asked to be early for xrays. No one even acknowledged the delay.

The nurse was very friendly and thorough, but Dr Batlivala was a huge disappointment. The nurse spent more time with me than he did. His bedside manner is terrible. He barely greeted me, never smiled, and hardly even made eye contact. His questions seemed like more of an interrogation than like he wanted to get to know me/help me. He kept asking why I was there, and what I wanted from him (which felt very weird and made me uncomfortable). I have issues with my back, and also autoimmune and neurological disorders. I was recently diagnosed with SFN, and also have lupus. I suffer from back pain and nerve pain and migraine headaches. I have seen several specialists and very much wanted to consolidate care.

I read everything on the website. I was so hopeful that I had found a place that could treat me, and a place where providers would work together on a treatment plan. I told Dr Batlivala that and he told me that is unrealistic, and that doctors don't have time to talk to eachother (maybe he needs to spend time on the website). He barely examined me. He didn't even ask me to come back.

I waited months for this appointment, hoping to meet a provider who could help. I hoped to find  a practice that would treat me as a whole person (and offer something besides pills). I was crying by the time I made it back to the elevator. Very disheartened by the lack of care and compassion.|This doctor does not listen to his patients. I have sever back issues I went to him and suddenly I had a leg issue wait a wrist issue not once did he actually do his job,he is always rushing,has absolutely no manners at all .he puts u way underneath him ..I rate this doc a 1 I'd like to leave a 0 but
I recommend u find another doctor who will treat what is wrong and listen to what u have to say.|He was a great doctor he talked me thru my whole procedure I had for testing for carpal tunnel syndrome. It hurt but not that bad because he talked me thru everything. I would definitely refer him to anyone that need his doctor work.|Dr Batalava cares about his patients. He's intelligent on all different levels of back and spine issues.|Have seen Dr. Batlivala and I am totally delighted that he is taking a serious interest in the pain I am in.
He is a very personable doctor and shows that he cares.  He has given hope where I think there was none.
Thank you doctor.|I just started seeing this Dr. but so far he has taken a serious aggressive approach to pain I've had for over two months. I'm very grateful for his time & services so far.

I would highly recommend him to anyone who is in need of a professional affordable chiropractor|The Pain Relief Center staff are always friendly and professional. Dr. Steve always listens to my chiropractic needs and develops an individual treatment plan to meet those needs.

There's been times when I went in having trouble even walking, and he always gets me right again. Now I go once per month for maintenance and I've never felt better. Everyone on staff is always friendly and welcoming - they treat you like family. I highly recommend The Pain Relief Center. Steve is fantastic. Give him a call today.|I am one of Dr. Dohoney's first patients going back over a decade.  I originally asked him to treat major back pain, which he did successfully long ago.  Since then, I've been on monthly maintenance with occasional back, shoulder and hand issues that he treats effectively.  Even if there are no specific pains, I see value in the monthly maintenance.  The doctor is usually on time and does not complain if I'm a little late.  A visit takes about 30 minutes.  He sends reminders via text.  He accepts my insurance and charges fairly for his services.  Personally, he is friendly and professional.  I actually look forward to the monthly treatments.|I can't say enough good things about the Pain Relief Center.  The office is clean & inviting,  the staff is friendly  and Dr Dohoney is amazing !!!
I am a 52-year-old woman who went sledding with her kids and ended up going off a jump and coming down really hard.   It caused severe neck  pain,  headaches,   &  back pain.  A friend recommended I give her chiropractor a try.   After weekly visits  a little over month later, I'm doing so much better.    Dr Dohoney not only treated my acute injury but has helped with chronic lingering issues as well.   I've had plantar fasciitis and Achilles pain on and off for years .  Treatments with Dr Steve have made it so much better.    I am truly amazed and excited by the results.    Over the years I have gone to different chiropractors sometimes two and three times a week and didn't get the results I've received with Dr Dohoney.    Life is too short to be in pain.   It would be worth your time to try something new.     You can't be100% or take care of others when you're constantly in pain.   Don't take my word for it, see for yourself.|I've been going to the Pain Relief Center for over 10 years.  Since starting my treatment there, my back pain has gone away.

They installed a spinal cord stimulator which they convinced me would help. Dr Luther installed it to far to one side. After numerous failed attempts by Abbott and Dr Luther to figure out why the stimulator only works on one side of my body they tried to use Dr ahn to tell me it was my anatomy that dictated where the stimulator would be positioned. Dr Ahn a lower spine surgeon was clearly upset that he had to see me for cervical spine / stimulator issue which he explained wasn't his specialty. I went back numerous times for more lies from Dr Luther telling me it was positioned correctly. They won't fix their mistakes and keep telling me it was correct even though X-rays and their own doctors and a hospital in Boston said it had to be REDONE. They wanted to charge my insurance for another surgery over $75 k to fix there mistakes! So they get all of the money the second time around! Stay away from the workers comp section as Maureen is a liar, they are not there to help you they are there for your insurance companies money! There is a group of doctors that make the decisions in that facility and they don't care about you! Stay away, it should be NEGATIVE STARS!

She has made an amazing difference  -- for the better -- in my quality of life. My back, etc. had plagued me for decades until I went to  see Trish at the suggestion of another doctor (D.O). Trish helps me immeasurably, allowing me to be active. I have urged numerous friends and family members to go see her and they also have been helped.|Dr Trish Murray is a gifted body worker. Even when I think I am feeling pretty good, she manages to adjust something that makes me realize I was actually pretty darn sore there and just ""living with it."" Her office is well run by a pleasant and intelligent staff who know how to get most out of my insurance company.|I have been a long time patient of Dr. Murray. I first saw her for a chronic back injury in 2005.  She had me back to an active lifestyle in 30 days after 18 months of no results working with other providers.  I have continued to see her for back and hip adjustments and most recently for some other functional medicine bloodwork.

The first thing you notice when you come to the office is a sense of calm and welcoming. Dr. Murray always takes the time to explain to you what she is doing, go through in detail a review of any tests you have and discuss with you your goals for your results. In so much of healthcare you feel like a number and an item on a checklist. At Dr. Murray's office, I feel like I am working with a partner who wants to see me achieve optimal health.

I was a patient for a year, and after he made money off his injections and I was still in pain, he got frustrated and said I needed a shrink.  He's a poor excuse of a man.  He should be barred from touching another human being.  The medical board should take away his license.  I wouldn't sent my worst enemy to him.  He's not fit to treat a snake!!! After I treated with a real physician I had surgery for a herniated disk that had partially ruptured.|I personally feel that Dr. Connelly was very thorough & compassionate. He listened to my issues & felt that an MRI on my neck was necessary to find out the reasoning for my pain. Something that my previous doctor refused to do because he thought I was lying about my pain. I have a herniated disk in my neck that is pressing against my spine & seeing a chiropractor didnt help nor did neurontin or muscle relaxers. He scheduled me for steroid injections that I had done today. He is a fantastic doctor & I would recommend him to anyone.|Dr.Connelly does not even deserve 1 star.. I had an appt with him..before my appt i googled him and read really bad reviews.So i went through with the appt. I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease in the past. He told me it's all in my head. His opinion was to go see a psychiatrist.. I was so upset after talking with him...
So all these reviews are very true about him..
Stay away from him. Do not waste your time!!|Was seen by Dr Connolly on three different office visits.   He was extremely rude and arrogant on all three visits.  He came very close to me physically showing him he can't treat patients like this.  Shouldn't be practicing medicine.

He does ""not"" cover my medications as well as injections..  His ""chosen Therapy""  is injections.  I explain to my insurance that he was a neurologist from New England neurology. And I'm not sure why they even had him covered under a pain management. So I don't know why they're sending people to him for that. Maybe they'll correct it and then they won't be problems or confusion as to what he really does. I did not enjoy my visit.|I'd choose NO STARS, if I could! After breaking my back 8yrs ago, and living with extream chronic pain, Dr. Connelly refused to do a full exam (no x-rays or MRI) and had the gull to tell me (because I suffer from anxiety) that my injuries are all in my head! This is after starting the visit 25mins late. What a terrible expieriance! I would NEVER recommend him to anyone with anxiety and depression!!!|I was diagnosed with an L1 compression fracture. My PCP recommended Dr. Connelly. On my first visit, Dr. Connelly ordered an MRI. The results showed that I actually had 3 fractures. I was in terrible pain. Dr. Connelly recommended a Kyphoplasty. The idea of anyone working on my spine was frightening. Dr. Connelly talked me through my fear. I hobbled into Northeast Rehab at the end of May. Dr. Connelly performed the Kyphoplasty, and the excruciating pain was gone when I left Northeast Rehab 3 hours later. Dr. Connelly is amazing. He was nothing but kind and knowledgeable.

Rob is so kind and gentle. He explains things thoroughly in terms I can understand. He was very good at providing me with information I needed in order to decide whether or not to proceed with my injections today. Physicians should observe Rob when he interacts with patients and take notes!|I was injured while caring for an elderly gentleman at work and my life changed in that moment. Dealing with an injury in and of itself is emotionally draining & physically painful. The overwhelming feelings of anger, sadness, and fear become a part of daily living; workers compensation and even the employer compound the emotional upheaval, demonstrating they actually don't care about any of these feelings; their only loyalty is to saving and making money!

The silver lining in this cloud of darkness has been the professional, genuine, and sincere care I have received from everyone at The New Hampshire Orthopedic Center. They have been attentive to my physical and my emotional needs. I have been treated with dignity and respect, just as I have always treated my own patients. Thank you to all of you for the care and consideration you have given. You truly do provide quality care,  thanks for having my back!!!|I went in for a cortisone shot in my shoulder.

I arrived 10 minutes prior to my appointment and it felt like I no longer down in the waiting area when I was called back to be seen. When I was seen, all my questions were answered thoroughly. Thank you, keep the great work up.|Very good experience today with Dr. Fortney. He went over the results of my MRI and options. He took the time to breakdown the results and went in detail about the two shoulder replacement procedures. He also answered my questions about the 2 options

He is totally dedicated and honest with his approach! My operation on my lower back was a complete success and he gave me my life back to enjoy the things I'd love to do physically!|The Medical Staff is amazing. Getting a human to call you back and/or process a prior auth in a timely manner is a big issue. So far it's taken 17 days to get a medication refilled, despite calling and faxing over the POA request.|That has to be by far the worst and most unprofessional secretary ever. Literally the worst in history... I'm shocked and wish I recorded it. I almost thought I was being punked but it was real. There has to be some kind of blackmail or something going on because no honest and respectable business would put up with a person like that even once...|Doctor Anna Terry (Neurosurgeon) is absolutely one of the best doctors that I've ever had treatment with in my entire life of 64 years. I will absolutely guarantee that you get great treatment and response from her.
Also Maleny, one of her assistants in the office Is absolutely one of the nicest most professional secretaries or office assistants that I've ever encountered. It is one of the very few doctor's appointments that I actually enjoy going to.. Thank you so so much for Doctor Terry and her office assistants for being so nice.  Doctor Miller in the same office is also a great neurosurgeon.|I would give no stars if I could. I have been dealing with a mystery illness for almost a year now. It causes me daily vertigo and severe migraines. This condition is debilitating, and I can barely leave the house most days. Dr. Trachtman prescribed me a medication that finally helped with the migraine aspect of things. The Lawrence location will not answer my pharmacy to refill my prescription, let alone me. It has been over a month with no medication and my condition is worsening again. I was also told by Lawrence General Hospital to call and have him clear me for an anesthesiologist to get an MRI (severe claustrophobic), and nobody will call me back to let me schedule!!! I am sent to full voicemail boxes and hung up on when I try to explain my situation. Absolutely ridiculous phone services and rude nurses in person. Do not go here, for the sake of your health.|If I could give a negative number of stars I would.  I had an appointment 3 weeks ago and arrive 20 mins early, as requested in all the paperwork I received.  It was over an hour to check in at the front desk and then 45 more mins to see my doctor.  I have been calling and asking for a detailed receipt of my payment to submit to my FSA and have been told repeatedly that they can't give me a receipt and keep giving me the same number to call, where I get this same response.  I was sent for X-rays, which involved taking time off from work and an hour drive to get to Lowell only to get there and find out that the doctor wrote the script incorrectly.  I have now been waiting over an hour here for the X-ray because they obviously can't do that without an accurate script.  The lack of customer service and the obvious lack of care for their patients is abhorrent.  Once I have these X-rays I will be looking for someone else as I wouldn't trust this place to be able to accurately diagnose or treat me for a common cold.  From start to finish this has been an awful medical practice to work with!|I can't believe the neglect I have been getting from Robert Miller and his entire office, multiple times I have called to be put on hold and get hung up on.. my voice is NOT heard. I have children to live for, i Own a house and I work 50 hours a week. Which is very difficult with a 15 year old head injury. I have fluid build up and I am forming cyst. I have had multiple MRIs and they couldn't even get those done correctly. My injury is causing extreme nausea and dizziness I can't live my life it's very painful. I explained this to my doctor and his assistant and every time I get told I am wrong. I was told there was nothing he could do about it and if he were to drain it like I asked that it wouldn't help my problem and it's a risky operation. My pcp recommended I get it drained due to the pain and I am being neglected on it by this entire office. Unbelievable these people do not care. I would strongly recommend any other office than this one and they lost me as a patient. I will say when I do get this fluid drained and my problems hopefully do go away. I will be sueing this office due to neglect and making me suffer for months on end because my voice was not heard. You can't tell these people anything. Unbelievable huge waste of my time. 6+ months|Just over 5 months ago, Dr Ty performed a double surgery on me(laminoplasty & carpal tunnel....all went well, or so I thought. I had a wonderful 2-hour visit with my 2 kids & my 2 grandsons....my son even saying ""Mom, it's the best I've seen you look in 6 months!"" That was about to change....
When I first arrived in my hospital room I was told pain meds every 4 hours. The next morning was told I'd be given meds ""as needed."" I questioned it, I just had double surgery & have severe chronic back issues that was slated for surgery upon recovery from this surgery. ""Doctor's orders!"" As the surgery meds wore off, I was in severe pain & needed help to get to the bathroom. By the morning, I was experiencing excruciating & immobilizing pain, I couldn't even lift myself up. I spent the entire time at Lowell General Hospital in that condition. The only time my meds were increased is when I was transferred to rehab 3 days later, so I wouldn't enter that facility practically an invalid....I was able to walk to the stretcher & my rehab bed.
I was then put back on the same dosage of pain meds Dr Ty had me on. They resorted to dragging me out of bed(as staff did at LGH) which eventually led to a brutal assault by 2 CNA's because I was in too much pain to even move & which I'm still traumatized by. This is by far the most agonizing experience in my lifetime(& I was a burn victim as a kid)! Safe to say, Dr Ty won't be performing my back surgery!

He is an excellent pain management Doctor Who listens carefully..
Pain management Doctors have to be a a special breed!
They need to have great intuition!
He really knows the art of helping people with chronic pain.
My wife and I are very glad we came across Dr. Rubinfeld.
We've been seeing him probably over 15 years now..
It's hard to believe it's been that long!
The injections he gives are fantastic for nerve pain when it becomes a chronic issue.
If you're unfortunate enough to be a chronic pain suffer don't wait make an appointment to see Dr. Rubinfeld!
Thank you for everything Dr Rubinfeld........

I just went to the surgical center and had an injection done for my lower back pain.
At Dr. Rubinfeld surgical center they truly have it down to a system. You are in and out of there quickly and dare I say painlessly.
And hopefully eventually a lot less pain than you went in with.
The staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable, fast and efficient.
A lot of hospitals could take lessons from this surgical center.

I had lower back pain that has been bothering me for many months.
It aggravated the nerve damage that I have in my left leg which then becomes virtually unbearable. I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and sweating it hurts so much at times. So much so, my cardiologist had me on a heart monitor to make sure that it was just the pain causing all of the readings she was getting.
Then after that of course sleep would be impossible. I would have to go to another room and sit in a recliner just the right way and watch the sun come up.

Thanks to Dr. Rubinfeld the injection was successful in significantly/dramatically lowering the pain in my lower back.

Now maybe I can get a few decent nights of sleep!
My lower back is no longer aggravating the nerve damage in my leg nearly as much. I've been doing some light yoga and stretching as well.
My left leg I've learned over the last 20+ years is a lost cause but, with the pain being dramatically better in my lower back the leg has returned to the previous level of pain. That is way more tolerable! Now at least I feel like I can deal with this level.

If all you have in life is normal aches and pains you should count your blessings.
I haven't been pain-free since 1999.
I find that my life is divided into two major sections, before Pain and then after Pain became my companion.

Chronic pain takes a huge toll on every aspect of your life. It robs you of being able to make great memories with your children, and being a decent parent at times.
It changes your life, and not for the better.

Dr. Rubinfeld is very cautious and knows his field. I would highly recommend the services to anyone.
He's very personable and reads his patients very well. I am thankful for guidance.
Dr. Rubinfeld is very compassionate and understanding as well.
Thank you Dr. Rubinfeld again thank you for your professionalism!

I added a photo of my wife and I on our 40th wedding anniversary.
This is just 2 1/2 weeks after I had my injection in my back.

I wanted to show that behind these reviews are real people that are trying to live their lives in chronic pain. If you notice I'm standing relatively straight and at that moment I remember not being all that conscious of pain.
That in itself made a great day!
Later that evening I was very thankful for the injection and Dr. Rubenfeld's professional work.
The photos of the things you see me doing I am able to because of Dr Rubinfeld. I'm very thankful to be a patient...",2025-02-26|2025-01-24|2025-02-05|2024-11-23|2024-12-14|2024-11-25|2024-12-10|2020-11-27,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|10 a.m.",74.4|73.8|65.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|good_doctors|thorough_care|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations,,,,,,,,,,ChIJJYLrSy6nw4kRewyRrWOKjbk,650

Its great to always be greeted with smiles from Lawry & Infiniti. They are always professional and kind- the best part is that they dont wait until u complain about wait time they already letting the doctors know how long your waiting. Always serving the interest of patients. Thank you for being a great team!|Wonderful  staff, great therapists and just a joy to be in there. Have been slowly recovering from multiple issues and each one addressed with care. A bit far for my taste but I prefer the great vibes from this place over any other place|As a healthcare provider who has traveled extensively across the United States and visited some of the most esteemed institutions, I can confidently assert that New Jersey Institute for Pain Relief stands out as a unique facility where high-quality, compassionate care is assured.

From the moment you enter and interact with the staff, it is evident that patient care is the top priority, extending through to the conclusion of your appointment. The convenience of having all your treatment needs addressed within a single facility is truly remarkable. Appointments are scheduled efficiently, ensuring timely service. Even during brief wait times, Laurie, Gabby, and Infiniti prioritize your comfort in the waiting area by engaging in lighthearted conversation and ensuring a welcoming atmosphere, all while efficiently managing multiple tasks.

My previous experiences with physical therapy have often felt impersonal and rushed, resembling a factory-like approach with less than satisfactory care. In contrast, whether you are under the care of Ely, Tai, Daniel, or Dr. Joe, you can expect a personalized approach that prioritizes your overall well-being. They exert an unparalleled effort to enhance your recovery, and I find myself uncertain of how I could ever express my gratitude to them. Experiencing time away from work as a result of my injuries has occasionally left me feeling disheartened. However, the physical therapy sessions I attend have transformed into a form of mental therapy, as the positive energy of the therapists is both uplifting and infectious.

While I recognize the benefits of chiropractic services for my overall care, I still experience some apprehension. However, Dr. Rodriguez's sense of humor and compassionate bedside manner significantly contribute to alleviating my fears, providing an effective distraction during my visits. I must acknowledge Will, who consistently checks in on my well-being and takes care to ensure my comfort.

The physicians at this practice are truly exceptional, demonstrating a remarkable blend of compassion and empathy. A doctor who dedicates time to listen, regardless of their patient load or the demands of the clinic, makes a significant impact on patient care.

Every provider has consistently exceeded expectations. The atmosphere in Dr. Nickel's office is reminiscent of a spa, contributing to a calming environment that alleviates the numerous challenges I have encountered. Her supportive demeanor is unparalleled.

Dr. King took the time to thoroughly explain my condition, clarifying the situation in a way that alleviated my concerns. His reassurance instilled in me a renewed sense of hope.

After experiencing no relief at a previous practice, my experience has transformed my outlook, giving me confidence that I will soon regain my quality of life and be able to offer the same exceptional care to my patients.|Dr. CHAKO is the best orthopedic surgen!!! Thank you so much for helping me recover! And the office statf at NJ institution of pain relief are the best. Thank you all for your service.

Prior to my procedure, the doctor did the most thorough exam that I have ever received from any previous pain management doctor. He took his time explaining what to expect. The procedure itself went smoothly.  I highly recommend him.|Dr. Varma has been able to help me regain a quality of life that constant severe pain robbed me of for decades. I'm truly grateful. The staff at the Gramercy offices are just as wonderful. They've been helpful, accommodating and polite. So far I've never had to wait, they've all been ready for me at the time of my appointment. They have also made sure all the necessary insurance approvals were received prior to surgery, so there were no unpleasant billing surprises. If you're willing to follow Dr. Varma's advice he has the insight and talent to help you, but you need to do your part too.|Dr. Varma is very courteous and caring. He listens to your questions and responds thoroughly and thoughtfully. During the epidural procedure, he saw I was nervous and talked me through the entire process (and I didn't even feel an inch of pain). His office is very clean and modern and his office staff is very nice.

I can -- for now -- throw my stronger pain meds out the window. Look into reducing, if not eliminating, your discomfort by seeing Dr. Deygoo.

Her staff is great too.|I was referred to Dr. Shane Volney by a friend that used to work for him. I have two bad knees, and really don't want to get knee replacement surgery. Dr. Volney removed fluid from my knee, and gave me a cortisone shot in both knees. I didn't feel anything. It's how good Dr. Volney knows his business. It was painless. In January and February, I had awful Sciatica for 8 weeks. I went to see Dr. Volney again, and he gave me an epidural shot in my lower back. Again, it was painless. I started to feel better soon after the epidural. I just took my husband to Dr. Volney last week because he has been suffering with a pinched nerve, and bulging discs in his back. Dr. Volney is not only an excellent Doctor, he is the nicest and kindest man. He has the nicest bedside manner, and truly wants to help you and take your pain away.

So many drs have tried over the years to do these and they never worked before. I just wanted to say thank you to him and how much I appreciate him and the hospital staff that day at short hills surgical center. Everyone was amazing from the time I checked in until I left.   I give Dr. Ramundo 5  from Allison|Dr Ramundo is very conscientious. He truly cares about his patients and does not rush through the visit. Very knowledgeable  and is willing to go the extra step- communicating with my other doctors to offer his expertise. His staff follows through, are competent and communicative.

He is treating my husband, however I have been with him for every appointment over the past several months and I can see that he is being treated like he one of Dr. Ramundo's immediate family members!

Mary Basile|Dr. Ramundo was fantastic! He actually listened to my concerns, answered my questions in a manner that a non medical professional like me could understand. The Short Hills surgical center and all it's staff were also incredibly wonderful. My entire experience with Dr. Ramundo, his staff, and the surgical center staff was A+, definitely 5 stars! Would highly recommend seeing Dr. Ramundo if you are suffering from unmanageable pain. Oh, and did I mention, I am pain free after following the recommended course of action from Dr. Ramundo and my Orthopedic doctor. Thank you!|My name is Scott ... For the last 20+ years I've lived with pain on all levels all the time. The difference between dr ramundo is that he not only listens, but also dives in to find and cure the root cause of it. It's just different with him because he not only relates with his patients, but also has an amazing bedside manner and is compassionate to my needs. He hires the most amazing people around him and his staff works tirelessly to help in any way they can. Although my situation is going to be this way for my remaining years, he helps me to do the best I can as pain free as possible even though in my case pain will always be significant. What more can a patient ask for??? If your willing to open your mind to different solutions, he stands behind you with your needs. There aren't enough stars allowed for him and his staff ..... there is nothing worse then being in pain and feeling like no one is there for you. The girls on his staff always work tirelessly to help solve any issues that's come up ASAP. There will always be people that are unhappy. In my opinion they probably didn't give these great people they time and effort it takes to solve the issues needed....|Dr Ramundo really understands the chronic pain I experience, and he treats it appropriately and effectively. He discovered an underlying cause which is a game-changer in my diagnosis and treatment. I remain grateful to him for his compassion and excellent medical care.|As a healthcare professional, my work involves assisting clients to find appropriate treatment providers for resolution of their medical conditions. Most recently, I encouraged a reluctant client to change providers and get another opinion from Dr. Ramundo at PMP. Her condition had been dragging on without much progress at the prior physician office. At the first visit Dr. Ramundo provided an additional diagnosis that could be the cause of her pain and recommended she bring additional test results to his office. He proceeded with procedures that were helpful for both conditions and after just a few short visits the patient was satisfied with her results and was able to get back to her normal activities. She was so happy with her results that she was giggling like a child at her last visit and thanked the physician and myself for the assistance. It is so gratifying to really be able to make an impact on another individuals life!

This is a chance to thank that whole team, and all their staff as well.|I was reluctant to going back seeing a Pain Management Doctor because of past experiences and little results.  My rheumatologist kept nagging me to see one so I gave it another try. When I went back to Redefine, I told them that I needed a doctor that had patients, great bedside manners and have a lot of compassion for what I had been going through because I didn't like the treatment from the other doctor.  They scheduled me with Dr. Hirapara and assured me that he was all of what I was looking for.   I'm so glad I gave him a chance and needless to say, I have been very pleased with him; he has done everything to make me comfortable and that's all I wanted .  I would refer anyone to him.|The staff was personable and helpful.  The wait time was not long and I was in and out quickly.  Dr. Hamer answered all of my questions and she made me feel comfortable asking questions.  They are one of the best teams that I work with.|The doctor was very professional and I really appreciated that he took his time to explain my options. Visit was not rushed and all paperwork was online. I didn't have to fill anything out when I went into the office. Highly recommended.|Dr Hamer, is very thorough. I have found her to be very knowledgeable, caring and relatable. Easy to talk to as well. I love that she has taken the time to listen and address my concerns as well as those of her own.

Dr. Shah was very pleasant and knowledgeable about what my concerns were. He was very precise with the plan of action, and executed the plans with haste.

I was able to schedule a consult faster than expected with Dr. Ko in the Livingston, NJ office. The staff was great from start to finish; amicable, thorough, patient & totally professional. I was able to tell them everything that I've experiencing. The nurse practioner asked me questions and noted everything I said. Dr. Ko was fantastic. I felt very comfortable speaking with him, he asked me questions & listened to me patiently and answered all my questions.

He uncovered issues beyond what I had approached him for before starting any treatment and simplified medical jargons with backed up research literature. He is quite pleasant to talk to and his bedside manners are immaculate. He takes the time to listen to and answer all questions. We are midway through the treatments and I already notice huge differences in my lifestyle and mental health. His office and assistant Nicole are extremely accommodating and pleasant to work with.

I am truly thankful to the entire group and feel lucky to have found them.|Dr. Ko gave me my life back. After living with chronic, misdiagnosed pain for years, he was able to identify the actual problem and implement an effective treatment plan quickly.

I'm eternally grateful to Dr Ko; his knowledge, care, bedside manner, and attentiveness were like a lighthouse in a storm for me.  It is amazing living this new life without pain!!|Dr. Shaw is extremely knowledgable and makes sure you understand all plans and procedures before you leave. His staff and technicians are top notch.

Shah, Nicole Bettini and staff are very pleasant and made my daughter feel at ease for her visit. Dr. Shah even let my daughter explain her knowledge of how reaction time and reflexes work.

No matter which office I go to everyone is always inviting and helpful.

You don't need to be in pain comes to Premier Pain Center they will always help you.|Dr. Walia is in my healthcare network and so I got very LUCKY. I had serious sciatic nerve damage and was treated by Dr. Walia and his VERY PROFESSIONAL STAFF!!!  I could hardly walk, I didn`t want surgery so I opted for ""shots"" to the area. Through his excellent care I was able after a few visits to at least go back to some ""quality of life.""
We both agreed it was time for my recent successful surgery.
Dr. Marc Malberg did my successful surgery
I honestly feel through Dr. Walia and his caring staff helped me with my sciatic problem

Being an active person, I was gaining weight and depressed. No more! As an added bonus, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes, if that. Make an appt today!|Dr. Sharma is the best. I had to get an epidural today for a pinched nerve located in my left butt that was traveling down my left leg to my toes and for the first time it was done in his office versus the surgery center. I was extremely nervous and scared. Dr Sharma and his staff put me at ease and was very patient and understanding with my feelings. I was amazed how painless the injection was. I felt a slight pinch, but other than that nothing. I feel great. I no longer have pain on my left side. I am so happy I did this and I highly recommend Dr Sharma for pain management. I am no longer nervous to get any epidurals in his office. I would give him and his staff more than 5 stars if I could. Thank you again Dr. Sharma.|I have had back pain for many years.

I called for an appointment and they were able to fit me in following week. From the minute I walked into the office I was immediately greeted with the warmest welcome and all the staff were just so nice. I met Dr. Sharma and after reviewing my MRI, he advised me what procedure he thought would work for me. Well, that was over a month ago and I am like a new woman. All my pain is gone!  Dr. Sharma is just amazing!  He was nice, compassionate and his talent and expertise has given me my life back!  I can do everything that I used to be able to do and I am no longer living in pain!

Ari and Rachel, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure I felt supported every step of the way. They consistently followed up with me, checked in on my progress, and offered invaluable assistance with administrative needs surrounding my surgeries. Navigating medical concerns can often feel overwhelming, but their thoughtful and attentive approach made the process so much smoother.

Dr. O'Donovan and his team are simply incredible--professional, caring, and truly committed to delivering the highest level of patient care. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone seeking compassionate and expert medical support. They are absolutely amazing!|I originally thought this establishment was a good choice. However, now i know better. My original doctor recommended 2 nerve block procedures that didn't work. In my opionion,  his communication skills were severely lacking. He was not available for my second nerve block, so another member of the practice performed the procedure. The last resort was a stimulator, which i already had. They contacted the rep for the stimulator, and the next day, she was able to provide me with much-needed pain relief. I feel like they wasted time and money and, in the process, caused me an additional month of unnecessary pain. And when i looked at my Visit Summaries, they were all incorrect. I've been trying to get corrected copies for almost 2 weeks, with no success. The office manager is not as competent as she should be. The only reason i gave 2 stars was the fact that the second doctor pointed me in the proper direction towards a solution.|Almost died after having an epidural injection.

Although neither my wife nor I sustained injuries, the lawyer recommended that we both undergo examination, suggesting Faheem Abbasi and Franklin Kumar, a physical therapist whose office is adjacent to Abbasi's, back in December 2022.

Both Abbasi and Kumar are not within my insurance network, which means I am responsible for the expenses. But I should have consulted my health insurance and checked online reviews beforehand, and I hope my experience can be help others.

The good: Convenient local office in Elizabeth, and scheduling appointments was straightforward.

The bad: The practice is small, leading to a lack of privacy as everyone can overhear discussions about medical issues. They conducted only a cursory medical examination, primarily asking questions and guiding through basic movements without a comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, the appointments lasted only about five minutes each. They suggested X-rays and MRI scans for serious issues, while simultaneously engaging in physical therapy sessions with his buddy Franklin Kumar across the hall.

The ugle: Billing was unclear and inconsistent, with charges varying each visit. Recently, I received a bill for a urine drug test from an unfamiliar laboratory, totaling $3,500, without prior notification or estimate.

In summary, I advise steering clear of this practice if you're seeking quality service. It seems they primarily handle patients referred by lawyers for injury claims, which might compromise the level of care provided while being money driven.|The dr has no bedside manner.

I can't say enough about her sweet personality, but she is the best APN that I have ever come across!!!  It's obvious that she cares deeply about your condition and does everything to make you feel at home!!! Also every one else who works alongside this business is also very kind.

I would recommend this place of business to anyone who is seeking great care!!!|I thank GOD for your wonderful practice and the associates that provide my care. Lori and Dr. Lesneski (hope the spelling is correct) are wonderful.  Aside from the drive (which I dislike) I actually look forward to the visits.
I would give both 10 stars. And others who have seen me in a pinch are also 5 star team members. From front desk to exit your practice is great.  I hope my support team never changes.
Thank you!  Judith Rose: Burns.|The place had a great atmosphere, the staff are courteous and efficient- very helpful and pleasant.

She seeks out new treatment options for me too. Anytime a problem arises during the month, I'm able to message her using their portal. She always responds and it's always so quickly!!

Very highly recommended!!!|I showed up to the office hopeful I would have my back pain addressed. Despite filling out all the paperwork prior, the office did not have it and I spent 25 minutes filling it out again. Then I spoke with a PA, not the actual doctor. He looked at my films/reports and suggested two more nerve blocks, stating I did not need new images, my year and a half old images would suffice. He stated I could call next week and he would call in the prescription. The following week I called and the nurse stated I needed to come into the office. I explained I was just in the office last week. I stated what the PA stated to me. I asked her to please call me back. She never did. I had to call the office the next day where she stated the doctor stated to go back to my old doctor!!!  Now I'm still in pain and starting from scratch. This office should not have 5 stars.|Dr. Patel explain the procedure and asked if I had any questions.

So now I'm on the right path to take care of this. Thank you so much, doc. I really appreciate you. You may have saved my life. I'm forever grateful.You most definitely get a five. Star.|The front office staff was friendly and helpful. The office in Sewell is big and thoughtful in its setup- they have larger, comfortable seating that is good for people with back issues, in particular. Dr. Haleem was kind, empathic, and validating. He listened to me and provided me with a plan that felt comfortable to me. I was disappointed that I couldn't schedule my epidural sooner, but the medication changes he made for me have made me much more comfortable, which will make it easier to wait.|This was my first time at the office. I was
amxious and nervous. The office setting is very calming.
The staff was very warm and friendly. They made me feel secure. I was not rushed and the doctor really took the time to listen.

He is an excellent listener and engages in a very low key session where the patient has time to ask their questions and receive their answers. He offers an array of interventional and non- interventional options, discusses them with you, and gives you the opportunity to do or not do them, without any type of pressure. Thus far I have avoided intervention and gone the medication route. The Lawrenceville office staff of Brittany and Dalila are absolutely amazing. They follow up on things very quickly and are always eager to help, being very oriented to the comfort and convenience of the patients.|I've had an amazing experience at Performance Spine since day one!  The front desk staff; Andrea, Gianna, Casey, and Brittany, are friendly and helpful.  They work hard to schedule my appointments around my crazy life and make changes with a smile.  Dr. Guy really listened to my symptoms, ordered testing, and made and adjusted my course of treatment as needed without hesitation.  Sondra always has a smile on her face and made my visits enjoyable.

My treatment included visiting with the Chiropractor, Ashley, who made the process of healing relaxing.  I also had the opportunity to work with PT Gary who monitored my program and ensured that each stretch helped vs hurt.  The aides working in the PT/Chiropractic area; Carol, Mark, and Bryan made giving up my lunch each day enjoyable.  They were fun and energetic and always willing to help.

I'm beyond pleased with my experience and thrilled at the progress I have made.  The entire staff has helped me get back on track for the active life I enjoy living!

Thank you!!
Sandy|PSSM is the best practice for healing your injury without surgery. You are always greeted with a warm welcome and a nice smile from the girls in the front. (Erika, Dalila, Jasmine, Monet & Kim are all awesome!) The clinical staff not only gets you out of your immediate condition, they continue to work with you and get you feeling better than ever.  I have been a patient with them for several years through different injuries and I was always 110% better when I finished with my PT.  Dr Susie is an exceptional Chiropractor and I always feel amazing after my appointment. Chris is very knowledgeable and his PT plan for me worked phenomenally. Gary was also very effective with my treatment plan.  The staff is warm, kind, friendly and just amazing. I actually enjoyed my exercise time with Bri, Monique, Kristen, Tim, Tom & Ryan. They have a way of making it fun!|I would not recommend this office. I showed up once for a first visit bc my wrist hurt and he wanted me to do weekly acupuncture, get all manner of scans, and start hormone therapy.... I was like bro I have fibromyalgia the pain is essentially made up. Let me get some strong Advil or a cortisone shot. (I run marathons I just neeeded som support not anything wild) he refused until I got scans to check for crazy things like a bone spur? I'm like bro I just have fibromyalgia it's nothing.

Anyway decided he wasn't for me. But the billing saga, my god, I've never met a doctor who would call my emergency contact over and over and over again looking for me? Like what is this the mafia?!?! They were very unclear that I would be billed so much for a conversation about my wrist... and yes I have good coverage. This dude is literally WILD calling my family members about like 100$. Shaking me down for a penny.

TLDR
the best support for pain is someone who's gonna be honest enough to tell u Advil and some rest if that's the real answer. Red flags when someone shoves hormones not covered by ins. Down ur throat. Idk about this guy and I try to not leave negative reviews but he harassed my emergency contact. For a month. Weirdo.|I am eternally grateful to everyone at Performance Spine and Sports.  They are a 'one-stop service shop'.  They provide coordinated care and treatment all in one place.  No more running around to numerous doctors!  I love the convenience and the staff is so caring and helpful. The nurse Beth is full of knowledge and compassion and she will drop anything to help you.  Dr. Guy is extremely thorough and determined to find the right treatment to get you feeling like yourself again.  Dr. Susie is by far the best chiropractor I have seen in a very long time.  After just one appointment with her I was already starting to feel better the next day! Chris squeezed me in that day to get me evaluated and start planning my PT regimen.  I was extremely happy and feeling very optimistic when I left that day.  I instantly felt like I was being treated like family.  You couldn't ask for more experienced, more thorough or nicer treatment.  I highly recommend Performance Spine and Sports!|I have been a going to Performance Spine and Sports Medicine for over a year and I would not go anywhere else!  I have been to other physical therapist as well as orthopedists and none compare to the staff here.

Nicole is my main Physical Therapist, but I have also worked with Gary and Katrina.  Each are knowledgeable and caring.  They take their time with you and really listen to you.  When they ask how you are feeling, they mean it.

Their aides are fantastic!  Carol, Mark, and Brian are there to help get everything set up and give you any assistance that you may need.  They also treat you with care and a smile, always willing to get you whatever you need.

Ashley is the Chiropractor and she is great!  She is gentle yet knows exactly where to push and pull to get things in perfect alignment.  I am always so relaxed after an adjustment.

The reception staff (Andrea, Gianna, Casey, and Brittany) greets you with a smile when they check you in.  They work with you and your day when scheduling appointments and are always pleasant! I usually deal with Gianna and Andrea.  They are very professional and make sure to greet me on the way in and out.  Their customer service is tops!   I look forward to each visit.

Dr. Guy and Sondra take very good care of me.  Sondra sets me up when I get to the office.  She is kind, gentle, and thorough.  She never has a harsh word whether taking my blood pressure or making sure I have approval for a procedure.

Dr. Guy has helped me immensely.  I have decreased my opioid intake and still decreased pain through his guidance.  I have also had alternate therapy such as acupuncture and others.  I have been able to avoid surgery, where as other physicians have guided me towards going under the knife.  I am beyond happy with the results!

I have improved a great deal since coming to Performance Spine and I see nothing but more healing to come.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about the facility and staff.|My experience working with Dr. Wiederholz has been top notch every step of the way.  He's a master at diagnosing and identifying the possible sources of pain and has an extensive tool kit of treatment options that he can draw from to provide pain relief.  From cutting edge techniques like Discseel and stem cells, to the more mainstream treatments like Intracept for basivertebral nerve ablation, rhizotomy, and more, Dr. W can do it all.  The knowledge, expertise and responsiveness of this dedicated pain management professional is impressive.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention how all of his medical prowess is ably facilitated by Dalila and Brittany, his NJ office staff. They're both super-helpful, cordial, and accommodating.

Over the past year we've made a ton of progress to address my multiple sources of pain stemming from a variety of old injuries and bodily wear & tear from decades of a highly active lifestyle.  Most notably, he's done a great job of helping me to eliminate and/or reduce my low back pain with a combination of treatments.  It's nice to once again awaken each morning and not be in a world of pain and discomfort.  With my improved mobility, I can once again pursue my many recreational activities with little to no hesitation.  For that I'm exceedingly grateful.  All in all, a very positive experience!|I have been seeing Dr. Manzi since before Performance Pain was founded. I cannot say enough good things about her. Using alternative treatments she got me off of the majority of my pain meds. This has made my pain more manageable. I can't say I have no pain, but it is better than it was and I have more awareness of things. I have also seen and had procedures with Dr. Wiederholz. He has the same views on alternate treatments as Dr. Manzi. They both have a great bedside manner and do not try to rush. All of the staff is very professional and willing to help.

He is thorough, explores all treatment options, and answers questions patiently and clearly. He has treated my pain successfully and follows up on my progress. I recommend him highly.|I was a patient of Dr. Goswami when I had a car accident. My treatments were paid for via no fault car insurance. While I was on the surgery table right before my procedure, he confronts me about payment issues. He was paid eventually after all the insurance troubles but totally thought it was inappropriate he brought this up as I was about to be put under rather than when I was in the office. He is very personable until it's about money. I get that it's a business but years later I still remember this very bad experience.

Response:

I was 100% a patient here. In fact, multiple times.  Please see other reviews and see that other patients were confronted rudely as well. I understand medicine is a business, however there's a way to keep it professional. Maybe have your staff discuss these issues while I am at the office and not on the procedure table.

To leave me a voicemail and tell me my insurance isn't good and just cancel. My appointment was extremely rude. First of all I made a mistake by even trying to reach the doctor to make an appointment and I spoke with him directly and he was absolutely nice, but whoever Linda is wow she shouldn't even be working if she doesn't like her job she shouldn't treat people that way, especially if they're going through a hard time. Shame on you. 
By the way, I got the best insurance from Horizon Blue Shield Blue Cross so don't go telling me my insurance isn't good.

Dr Patel used a combination of radiofrequency ablation and trigger point injections, supplemented by weekly physical therapy, to manage my pain.

My husband was being treated due to a car accident therefore it was the car insurance paying for the treatments. They did a procedure on my husband and when the follow up came they would not see him because his car insurance had ran out of money. How can you possibly deny a follow up visit on a patient that you did a procedure on. This was not a new procedure, it was a follow up. They did not call him to tell him they would not be see him, they waited until he went to deny service. What kind of dr has a procedure done on a patient and does not follow up to see if what he recommended worked. And now we are trying to get his records and they are giving us a hard time. Are they hiding something? This dr is very unprofessional and unethical. A follow up visit to review your work is a must and is included in initial payment. Also, when we tried giving them our personal medical insurance to at least see if the procedure worked they denied it.|I am a 49 year old active male/business owner that finds himself in the gym five to seven days a week. My spinal pain impeded my ability to stay healthy mentally and physically and on my terms. It was a huge distraction. Quite frankly it made me miserable, and I was withdrawn from social activities as well as work. There was no pep in my step because the pain was so overwhelming that all my energy went to combating that feeling. I do not wish it on anyone-well, maybe one or two people....
Fortunately, I was referred to Doctor Patel (via an MD/DO) approximately one year ago and that was the game changer. The first point of contact is the Office staff and the office staff is pretty much like hanging with friends. Down to earth wonderful people that guide everyone fluidly.
After my second visit with Dr. Patel, we had a plan of attack. I understood the problem and the plan on how to correct it medically. Dr. Patel was spot on at every turn in terms of treatment and time frames, and of course as treatment progressed, my health improved and my confidence in him grew. He is not aggressive or passive just logical and understands how to speak to his audience. When you look forward to going to the doctor you know you are in the right place. Thank you Dr. Patel!|Dr. Patel is one of the most professional and kind physicians I have gone to for treatment.  He is kind, compassionate, and thorough.

I came to this office for help and after an exam I was set up immediately with my 1st epidural injection and let me tell you, the pain was gone and the care I received was excellent. I didn't have to wait weeks for relief. My 2nd epidural injection was scheduled for the following week and I never looked back to that pain returning again.

I highly recommend this office if you have any kind of back pain.|I honestly came to see Dr. Poonia through word of mouth, I usually never go to Dr.s this way but he is a very reliable person. I've been going to my other pain Dr. For 12 years so with the same pain, month in and month out. Just getting trigger point injections my monthly meds but it's not enough.  So I came for a consult and left in tears with all the things we spoke about. Happy tears actually that there is a hope that I can be pain free for the new year or at least in way less pain than normal. He will actually target the specific areas not just inject some pain relief so I can be back again next month.  I continue to pray it works. I'll come back with an update in a few months. Beside that the office staff is very friendly and professional from the moment I walked in ( Clifton Office) . Even their phones manners are very nice.  They listen take the msg like you want them to receive it.  So thank you office staff also.

He walked me through the entire process with knowledge, care, and delivered a perfect surgery. I was active with a small limp at 3 weeks, running at 4. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and recovery. Thank you!|Dr. Hanauer is amazing. He is extremely thorough. He is knowledgeable and very kind. He also does everything non-invasive before recommendations anything surgical.  I highly recommend him.|I had good experience with Dr Levy's consult. However the billing handled by this office was very incorrect. They told me that it's in network provider and however after my visit was done they charged me $195 which was supposed to be for out of network. When I asked them, they said, ""your plan is good and regardless for in-network or out-of network this is your copay"". After I called my insurance I found out they were not in network. The office staff (and even Dr Levy) was very dishonest about how they handled this.|I found Dr. Patel summer of 2023 after experiencing some pain in my hip. During my first visit he did an amazing job validating my concerns and sending me on my way with a cortisone shot and a follow up to talk about next steps on treatment.

Not even a few weeks later we discussed the possibility of surgery and that my symptoms were probably leading to something that had to be fixed beyond external measures.

I was moving in a few months and was getting married a few months after that, so unfortunately I was on a fixed timeline toying with my health and a few life events.

Dr. Patel and his team prioritized pushing up my surgery, which unfortunately uncovered something more major than the MRI unveiled, but he assured me that collegiate football players bounce back in mere months after this procedure. Through his ultra detailed post op recovery plan, combined with weekly then monthly check ins, I was back on my feet and dancing for my wedding 5 months after my surgery.|Be aware they do not take Aetna. Used Zocdoc to book my appointment with Dr. Patel. Both Zocdoc and front desk staff indicated I was in-network, get my EOB back and find out my 2 appointments were not in network & I'm being charged full amount for both visits.

Additionally Dr. Patel indicated I would need surgery for my condition. I went to get a 2nd opinion and was told there was no need for surgery. This surgeon saw no indication of an injury that would require surgery & my condition fully healed in the next month.

Garden state pain & orthopedics need to resolve this with Zocdoc and train front desk personnel properly as they are misleading their patients.|Dr. Saurabh Dang and the staff at Garden State Pain & Orthopedics are amazing.  Dr. Dang is extremely knowledgeable and personable.  He answered all of my questions and put me at ease.  He took so much time really getting to know my issues.

But he did a great job and it didn't hurt too much. The assistant that was in the room was also very attentive and kind. They really made me feel welcomed and eased my nerves.

The first visit with Dr Batt I was in a wheelchair. I could not walk without support and then it was painful and frightening. My quality of life has improved significantly. Now I walk alone or with slight cane assistance, It is like being with family for me now The nurses and staff are so friendly. They know me and we chat and smile.

I was injured at work in 2023 and as a result my lower spine became an absolute mess and continues to get worse. I have had 2 out of 4 procedures carried out by cooper pain management that did not go well, the last one (medial lumbar branch block) leaving me maimed.
Immediately after the procedure my pain increased past the point I thought pain could go-,it was indescribable. The morning after I got up and fell to the floor. I couldn't walk normally for over a month, my legs sporadically gave out and would fall several times a day needing a crutch to get around. I NEVER needed one before that specific procedure was botched. Any and all phone calls made regarding these concerns are not  ""on the record"" so they ""never happened"". I still have nerve damage in my legs and am in a state of excruciating pain 24/7. Unfortunately, the impression I have accumulated over the last year and a half is that Cooper pain management does not care about my pain or the permanent physical and emotional damage they have inflicted on me in the slightest regard.
They tried to gaslight me at my follow up over a month later to convince me that it's in my head and that I'm making up my symptoms to avoid any liability.  Do not go to Cooper for ANY procedure if you want humane and reasonable treatment without being treated like a psychosomatic drug seeker. If you're lucky they'll glance at your imaging- though in my experience they just read a 3 sentence report and schedule procedures MONTHS in advance with no pain management in between the several months you're waiting to be seen.
I feel that it is my moral obligation to warn other patients who may be experiencing similar issues. I know what it's like when you are so desperate to not live with all consuming, life ruining pain.

About two years ago I switched to Dr. Shah under the recommendation from many people who said he was such a great doctor he changed their lives. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my entire life. Dr Shah has literally saved me from a life of pain and has given me my life back. He explains everything, he actually takes the time out to really listen to you and you can tell he cares and has sympathy. I've had many epidurals, facet injections and about three months ago I underwent surgery to have the spinal cord stimulation machine put in. It WORKS unbelievablely well. It has reduced my pain by 50%. Because it was so successful I have been able to reduce my pain pills significantly.( Which was one of my goals) Thanks to Dr. Shah I can play with my kids again, do yard work, sleep laying down in a bed again. I have slept in a recliner for the past 5 years. With his help my relationship with my wife and kids has improved significantly. The surgery center he uses is top notch.

Dr. Bhatt did a  thorough examination after reviewing extensive imaging I provided to him, and he followed up with procedures and meds to ease my pain.  They are a lifeline for me!  -Dr. Bhatt and the entire staff are very professional and courteous.  The wait to see the assistant and Dr. Bhatt is practically nil!  Even though Covid is no longer the raging contagion it once was, it's comforting to see both staff and Dr. Bhatt to wear masks in interaction with patients! (Aside from Covid, masks also protects patients and staff in the office from the flue and the RSV [Respiratory Syncytial Virus].) The scheduling and follow up with reminders are always flexible and on time.  The electronic prescription fills/refills are right on schedule.  It's been a blessing to have found Dr. Bhatt and his staff through  recommendations by a friend and by a doctor referral.

The rudeness of the office manager, Lauren, and a few nurses at the surgical center made me discontinue my treatment despite the pain I'm still going through. I thought that their behavior would improve after I filed a complaint a few months ago to the medical director and  director of nurses who took harsh  actions against those who were involved in this despicable behavior. The director of nurses promised me that they would be disciplined, and she'll make sure no patient would ever go through what I did. Unfortunately,  the flippant behavior continued. Out of fear for my safety,  I stopped taking anesthesia for all the six procedures performed on my neck, shoulders, and back. I preferred to endure the severe pain instead because I wanted to be in full control afterward. Finally, I want to remind you that patients have plenty of options to pick and choose the facility they go to. Our insurance doesn't pay these facilities to disrespect the patients and treat them poorly. I regret deeply choosing this facility to treat me for my injuries.|I would say I got really lucky, that a simple google search lead me to Dr Amit Poonia and Dr Adity Sharma, I'd very suddenly developed unbearable pain in my leg and after exhausting all obvious options, I went to their practice. I was diagnosed correctly and the treatment I received was second to none. Because of them I've been able to go back to my old lifestyle and have been pain free.
They are very personable and their office has always been very responsive, each time I've called them.
I highly recommend them.|If it wasn't for Dr. Sharma, Dr.Poonia and the rest of their wonderful staff,  I'd probably be using a walker by now.

My only negative is the phone system. Too many press this, press that before you are finally connected to a live person. It would be nice if we were able to reach a live person on the first try if we truly have a clinical issue. I understand it's a large, busy practice, but our issues are still very important to us at the time we call, not 24-48 hours later! Thanks so much for the exemplary service!|Warning This practice discriminates and refuses care, based on insurance coverage. Medicare Advantage patients are denied all services. They just want your Copayment.  I was forced to retire at 48.  I was a Radiology Administrator, They did not know this.  I fired them after 2nd visit, PA would not prescribe an anti-inflammatory. I was refused epidurals and nerve ablation.|Everyone is nice and friendly except the woman who makes appointments when you leave in the TR office . Every time I've interacted with her she is grumpy gives off a vibe that you are bothering her.  I had to have an ablation I decided to change from doing it in the office to a surgicenter. When I called this woman she yelled at me ""well you have to fill out forms, have you had an EKG lately???, the forms will be in the office"". Basically hung up on me.  I never went back. She should not be dealing the public|They absolutely saved my life, I could not walk and needed a cortisone shot, for two months prior I was using another doctor, I was told  by the office  people a new girl there wrote  the wrong wording on the submission paper that goes to the insurance company for approval, for that reason I was denied. I stressed to them I had a vacation  and big job that took me out of state for a month and needed to have the shot they promised me it would be done, I had to go back for them to assess me and for Dr. To expedite approval number so he can do the procedure, to no avail, I was devastated. A day before I was supposed to leave still could not walk, I found Premier Pain Center, the office staff and doctor stayed after hours to look over my paperwork, MRI, X-ray, Etc. The next day he was able to accommodate my need and I was off and walking again pain free!. Truly amazing that people rallied and worked that hard for me. To assure I would be okay. I have no more words to thank them and let the whole world know they are the best people, doctors, and staff I have ever come across. Thank you again, Lori|Dr.Ombao has been fantastic,. Since the first time I met him he took the time to listen and understand my condition, he did x-rays and spoke to me about what he can do for me. He has been a blessing. He cares for his patients and their well being. The staff is warm and friendly . I would recommend it highly.|From the setting of my appointment to the moment I walked out of the office this medical office it was nothing but professional and caring. I received clear instructions to complete my first time patient forms via email as promised. They have an application for curbside check-in, loved it! Waited in my car until asked to come in. There was only one person waiting and 3 minutes later I was alone in the waiting room. The perfect setting for Covid times. Even the pens are clearly marked as clean and a container to place the used ones. Another person came in, masked of course and more than 6 ft away from me and a few moments later I was called in. The people in the reception area are prompt and professional. Dr. Li was clear about my diagnosis and recommendations.
I felt safe and well cared.
Thanks.|I could not be happier that I found this office!! I have had trouble finding someone who is willing to take the time to actually find out why I have the pain I have.  I've been to several places that made me jump through hoops fill out a lot of paperwork have TV commercials and then when you go after they send you everything to fill out basically tell you you're not covered with your insurance and it was a waste of your time.
This did not happen here from the onset of speaking with someone when I called there was true concern of the pain I was in I was given an appointment as quick as possible and when I went to the office I was treated the same way everyone there is friendly it doesn't seem like it's an issue for them to see patients which is exactly what you want when you're in pain you want someone that understands this office understands from the receptionist to the nurses to the doctors if I could give 10 Stars I would and I will update my review after all of my procedures are done and hopefully walking normally again but I've put my face and my health in their hands and I don't do that easily so I highly recommend this office as I said if I could give them 10 stores I would thank you guys so much for everything I really appreciate it!!

I have to say ""THANK YOU""  it has been two weeks since my initial review & visit.  I had a procedure done on my back yesterday morning and today is the first day in a very very long time that I was able to get out of my on my own accord and actually walk without pain!!! Can't tell you in words what a wonderful feeling this is and I can't thank Dr. Ombao enough for what he has done for me.
Again the staff is wonderful and so are the doctor's please don't hesitate if you have back and pain issues to give them a try. I know it may not work for everyone but I am telling you IT DEFINITELY IS WORKING FOR ME
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN|For the first time in many years I finally found a doctor who gave me some relief. I couldn't be happier. I know I need a little more work but I am sure that Dr Mak will put me back together. The entire office staff are so kind and professional and really care.

I am now in the process of leaving this horrible practice. The office staff and nurses are horrible. Never pick up the phone. Needed a peer to peer for a medicine, still haven't received it. I would think (and I had thought) that a pain mgmt Dr /office would be caring. Boy was I wrong!  This office and the head of the unit should be ashamed of themselves. They've had me in tears due to their lack of caring.|I was a patient at the New Jersy Pain Institute since my car accident in 2012.  During that time I was seen about once a month.  Dr. Sakr was ALWAYS  kind and compassionate.  He was willing to work with me using physical therapy, spinal injections  (13 in 5 years) and caring to avoid the ultimately necessary spinal surgery.  Complicating my spinal injury was my active rheumatoid arthritis.   With great care we were constantly adjusting my medications using the lowest dosage needed for my pain level at that time.  He was so kind, took as much time as you needed, spoke directly to you using understandable terms ( and re-explaining words I didn't understand).
Then Governor Christie got involved trying to stem the tide of opiate addiction.  Dr Sakr left but no one told me - until I specifically asked for an appointment with Dr. Sakr after 3 months with another doctor.  When those 3 appointments were scheduled I was only told Dr Sakr was 'away'.  When I pushed for an appointment with him they quietly admitted he had left the Pain Institute.  Everyone claimed they had no other info regarding his whereabouts or even if he was still practicing!  Wonderful thing about the Internet is I  located his current practice within 10 minutes.
So what about Christie?  He has deemed that any government supported facility (the Pain Institute is affiliated with RWJUH) must reduce or eliminate the amount of opiates prescribed.  I took too many and they couldn't afford my ""opiate level"".
I was given 2 one month scripts and unceremoniously 'KICKED OUT' of NJ Pain Institute  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find another pain management  provider after you have been KICKED OUT of another program?
Fortunately I found Dr Sakr's new practice and we had a good report.
Without Dr Sakr the NJ Pain Institute became rigid, secretive and uncaring - even the nurses and receptionists.
This is why I have lowered my rating of 5 stars in 2013 to 3 stars in 2018.|They never pick up their phone. My mother is in pain and I cant get in contact with anyone no matter what number i press on the automated phone system. I called 6 times in 2 days. Left my number when prompted. Waited on the phone for 2 hours today and still no response. My mother is suffering and I cant get anyone to return a call. Previously, when someone from that office called me back they provided a number that did not work when I called it back, said it was a rutgers number that was no longer in service. That office is packed with people, How can no one be able to pick up?|saw Dr Jongco looked me in my face and told me the pain I'm having is related to the diabetes so you're gonna tell me the whole body pain and severe joint pain I'm having is diabetes related I have rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis he told me to make a follow up for 3 months for what you're not helping me at all|Been With Dr Grubb For 2 Years And He's Probably The Best Doctor In The Whole Practice.|Awesome Dr.'s",2023-01-04|2018-01-02|2021-05-06|2023-01-30|2023-04-10|2017-09-29,1|3|1|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJNWBcklfGw4kR0ItAbGEAF-I,6

Although the waiting time to see a doctor could be extensive. The doctors that have worked on my medical issues, I found them to be outstanding  Physicians, they try to make the visit very comfortable while getting good results. The girls at front and the assistants helping the doctors, are also courteous and respectful. The whole place is kept clean and safe. Yes I would recommend this place.|THE WORST!!! for the last 3 months they have called and stated my moms insurance cant be verified, I texted a copy of insurance card they text back stating received. 3 months of the same thing, then then start claiming she doesnt have medicare another 5-6 calls of this. then they say she doesnt have medicare she has unitied healthcare (she doesnt). I say ok I will call the dr who referred her to find someone else, she so busy talking she didnt hear me. 3 months worth of aggravation when its not that big of deal I can find another doctor no need to talk over and harrass a patients family who has been through enough already. These girls are very arrogant.|My mother gets her knee shots here. She says the doctors are great. Ill be honest the receptionists or medical assistants (whoever at the front desk) are horrible. I had 2 incidents with them. They try to say my mom injections weren't available when I was the one who set it up for the injections to be delivered to the office all 3 of them. They called saying they have to cancel her appt becuz her injections weren't available. Ended up canceling my mom appt just to reschedule her cause they were wrong. Bad attitudes, no communication, lack of knowledge and no customer service skills. Definitely need new front desk crew! The doctors are great!|First, front desk can never answer your question always put into voice-mail.  Forget getting refills whether your there and doctor calls it in or if you ask pharmacy to call you ALWAYS end up having to call office complain and magically the pharmacy gets the request.  This had happened to me 5 out of 5 times.  They never call your insurance company for approval for a procedure you always have to follow up numerous times.  I was referred to this place since my regular place doesn't except my insurance anymore, I have made them well aware to stop referring as my problems are common complaints.  I'm still sitting with back pain after injections, it did nothing.|After trying a few pain management practices I decided to pick with Jersey Rehab because they are professional, respectful, kind and really take an interest in your health. Dr. Hajela is an expert on pain and has impressive knowledge in other medical fields. Dr. Hajela really takes an interest in my health. He never rushes me and he always carefully listens to my  symptoms.  I feel like he is on my side.  Dr. Hajela offers a vast spectrum of treatments that really works.  He changed my life last year when I was bed ridden with sciatica and extreme back pain.  He gave me an epidural for a severe herniated disc and within 48 hours I was up and walking and after some Physical Therapy I was feeling great again.  The staff at Jersey Rehab are also amazing.  They treat you with kindness and respect.  They go out of their way to remember your name and little things like trips I take or how my daughter is.  They also carefully listen to me when they are taking the pre-visit notes.  They go out of their way to change your appointment if you need to cancel or reschedule a visit.  They also pick up the phone.  When you call the office you get to a human being after listening to a very short message.  I don't think I have been on hold for more than 3 minutes every time I call. The office is immaculately clean and provides a welcome environment for patients waiting to be seen.  All in all Jersey Rehab has made my life easier after I suffered a severe fall.  I was miserable and in so much pain but they make it so I can live an almost normal life.  I don't know where I would be if it weren't  for the Jersey Rehab crew in Belleville, NJ.

Excellent  experience.   I would highly recommend him to family and friends.|I cannot thank him enough. Involved in a car accident, I was completely lost among all these money-pursuing medical providers. I visited his nj office for a 2nd opinion with a hope. Thank God, I did!! He was so prompt giving me accurate diagnosis, proper treatments. Unlike other doctors, he wanted me to try passive approaches first (PT & stretches) before he suggests me injections or any further treatments. He always checks on me if I am following my routine stretching exercise, first. His injections worked very very good. I was wondering why other doctors injections did not work like his. His insurance team is above excellence. Office staff is so very friendly. No complaints. 10 out of 10. Highly recommend to anyone in search for a reliable doctor. I truly appreciate Dr. Hanna and his staff!|As per me a good doctor is one who listens, understands and explains. Dr Hanna is one such guy. It's blessed to have a healthy life and lifestyle. But it's more blessed to right kind of doctors when in need. It's been a breeze to deal with his front desk either to set up or reschedule or discuss insurance.
Best part of their insurance division, who gives you a clear idea on how much will be charged and other details. All in all he has a great team.

I would highly recommend anyone in pain to see Dr. Hanna.|If I could give Dr. Hanna and his staff 100 stars, I (Mrs. C) would. Dr. Hanna is exceptional. First of all,  I would like to say thank you to Dr. Hanna and his staff for the amazing office he runs. His office is well organized. He is on top of what is going on with all his staff, medical issues and his patients. His staff is very respectful, welcoming, attentive and treats me with courtesy. The receptionists are very helpful and remind me of all my appts- thank you Maria for always calling me- I always look forward to you calls. His medical assistants are also very efficient.  Sydney has been AMAZING, attentive, efficient, comforting before my procedure. She listens to my concerns/worries, provides the information to the doctor in detail, helps out with referrals (like physical therapists or any other specialists) given by Dr. Hanna. The courtesy and generosity made me feel so safe. Dr. Hanna is incredibly knowledgeable with amazing beside manner. He answers any questions that I have and puts me at ease. I am so glad I found such a wonderful doctor. Dr. Hanna explains things in a way that are easy to understand. He listens carefully to any of my concerns.

HE ALWAYS SHOWS RESPECT FOR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY and he will spend enough time to make sure all my questions are asked. When considering a rating scale from 0 (worse provider) to 10 (best provider), I will give Dr. Hanna above 10. I have already recommended Dr. Hanna to my family and friends. I have no reservations in recommending Dr. Hanna.  Can't recommend enough!!!,     Mrs. C.|Dr. Hanna,

Thank you for giving me my life back!!!!!!!!!! I was completely out of commission for 2 weeks due to severe lower back pain. I could not move and was in agony! No one could help me- ER and primary doctor. With one visit to Dr. Hanna I am so much better! I got trigger point cortisone shots on Thursday which kicked in by Friday. I was out of the house all weekend and back to myself!! Getting better and better! I will be getting an MRI to confirm the actual issue however it might just be pulled muscle(s). Even if this isn't the permanent fix, it was enough to get me almost back to normal and able to live my life! My primary doctor recommended someone else because it's not in the same area- however, I could not be happier that I found Dr. Hanna! I never ever write reviews but this thank you is absolutely needed! Thank you Dr. Hanna!!!!  --All the best, Andrea|Very friendly atmosphere, nice and inviting place.

I've been a patient since 2012.|I have been a patient with Princeton Pain Management for treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia one the most difficult conditions to treat since 2005 (18 years ). I cannot express how much gratitude I have for Dr Abramov and the entire Office Staff . The high level of professionalism , bedside manner and compassion for me as a patient is second to none. I consider myself blessed and lucky to have found this practice many years ago .. I highly recommend anyone dealing with serious chronic pain to Princeton Pain Management, Dr A and the team ....
Donald M.|I have been happily seeing this practice since 2013.

Everyone in the office is cheerful, helpful, and really listens... from boss lady Loraine at the front desk, to Deani and Oxana the nurses (Oxana also wrangles tough insurance prior authorizations, et.), to Kristen their PA and newest member, to doctors Abramov and Kanter. I will always miss Dr. Chen, who has recently retired and was my doctor for 7 of 9 years here. All 3 doctors are very skilled with epidurals and other procedures and have excellent bedside manners.

In my opinion, this is the best pain management practice in the area!
Strongly recommend. You'll be treated as a person here... and soon feel like family.|A word to the wise: this place takes no responsibility for ensuring they have your insurance information prior to treatment when they are your anesthesia team.  It shouldn't be the patients responsibility to make sure things are billed properly when having emergency surgery; however, this place didn't bill insurance and then sent us to collection 2 years after treatment.  And when you call to discuss it with them, find out why you were sent to collection, the customer service rep is rude.  I asked to speak to a manager 3 different times because she was so rude to me (I was rude back but that's besides the point she started it and I am the customer you want $1000s from).  Thankfully the manager was helpful and able to resolve the issue and remove it from the creditor, but unfortunately too much damage had been done by them.  One star review is kind, the billing department is horrendous.|I was in severe pain after knee replacement surgery. Lorraine, the office manager, was kind and compassionate. She squeezed me in for an appointment the next day. Then I met nurse Viani(sp?) another great experience.
To top it all..
Dr. Aronov! Listened with patience to my complaint, asked many questions to get to the bottom of this and came up with a comprehensive plan to alleviate my pain. While prescribing the medications he was even sensitive to the cost of the medications.
I felt I'm in good hands. I highly recommend Dr. Abramov and his office staff.|Excellent Service:  Dr. Abramov is terrific at pinpointing not only your back/neck issues, but he also refers you to other specialists, if needed.

Kristin Fields, PA
She is compassionate and that is important I believe; She listens well
and responds with terrific help!
She is knowledgeable and treats the whole patient...I had a thorough visit and she gives 100% to you to solve your pain mgmt issues!!
I highly recommend a visit w Kristin, PA!!

He treats the whole patient. Princeton Pain's office works as a Team ( Lorraine, Dioni, Iksana) to bring the patient *top notch service for your every need!  Princeton Pain is an outstanding choice for you!  I can evaluate this  because I am a patient there for about 5 years.|If I could give a 0 I would. Years ago I called Dr Chen to advise him his over prescribing of narcotics created a substance abuse with my daughter that landed her in the hospital. Here we are 10 years later and my daughter is still fighting for her life thanks to the over and I mean over prescribing of narcotics to my daughter. I would not wish this hell on anyone. My daughter has attempted suicide and yes Dr Chen you started the ball Rolling. For anyone true pain management find a doctor who does not use narcotics for long term pain. They were meant to treat long term pain and especially at the level being prescribed by Dr Chen.|Dr Chen is wonderful.

Everyone is so nice and compassionate. You can really tell that all of the Doctors and staff are passionate about providing their patients with the best care. Dr.Patel is wonderful! She is very thorough and takes the time to explain, listen and answer any questions you may have as well as making sure you have the best course of treatment and care. If you are suffering I would highly recommend scheduling an appointment with this practice!|I am a wound care nurse who struggles with the pain of CRPS every day. The staff at this office have been so wonderful, I now send my patients to them! I only hear glowing reviews! I almost lost hope when my insurance denied a much needed surgery multiple times. However, through the profound effort of one Ms. Delya Anderson, I can happily say I will be receiving my surgery in two weeks! I have yet to find a pain management center with as many staff members willing to go above and beyond, you will not go home disappointed.|Ive been seeing Dr. Damien for slmost two years and feel very fortunate to be under his care.  He takes the time to listen and has been very helpful in managing my back pain.  His staff is also excellent and very courtious.|If you're looking for a practice to just get pain meds, go elsewhere. Dr Demian is an outstanding, conservative physician. I had been to 2 other pain Dr's with very minimal results. I was referred to the practice  by a friend after they had gotten great results. I met with Dr Demian, he evaluated me and came up with a plan which included physical therapy and injections. I, now basically live a normal life pain free. Don't get me wrong I have my bad days but by far more great days then bad. I have been with Dr Demian for over a year now and I can't think of one negative thing to say. The office staff and medical assistants are top notch. The office is very accommodating when it comes to scheduling appointments. I am very grateful I found Dr Demian. Living pain free 95% of the time beats being in pain anytime.|I have been suffering with back and foot pain for over 30 years.  I have been to many pain management centers, undergone many procedures(shots in different areas).  Dr Meenal Patil is the first doctor to get it right the first time.  I went in for a lumbar epidural and she did it right!. My hip and back pain were gone. I could sleep at night again for the first time in ages.   The foot pain however stayed.  The Doctor made sure I was able to get my second injection.   I went in for my second injection yesterday and this morning I got up and took my first steps without pain.  I feel like a new woman.  Dr. Patil is so sweet, she spends the time to listen to you and treat you like a friend.  I have never had a doctor get the shot right the first time.  She did. I highly recommend her to anyone that has chronic pain.  The staff is so nice and takes care of all the preserts for procedures efficiently and effectively.  I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to meet with the doctor.  I also went to the Hamilton Surgery Center , which is one of the surgery centers Dr. Patil office is affiliated  with , and they are just as cordial and nice.  I highly recommend this office and Dr. Meenal Patil.  Thanks Doc!|I was going to The Pain Management Center for over 10 years, following the Nurse Practitioner - Bill (who by the way is AWESOME) from his previous practice .  I suffer from multiple chronic pain issues and was compliant in their Medication Management program.  I did EVERYTHING I was asked to do by this practice, My urine screens were always spot on, etc... yet, when I showed up for my December 2017 appointment, I was told that this would be my last appointment with their practice and was given a 30 day supply of medication and a list of other area Pain Management Doctors.  I was told there was no guarantee that another doctor would take me as a new patient.  I was offered no assistance in finding a new physician.  Their reason?  It was too difficult and time consuming to keep all the DEA records and such on MM patients.  In my opinion?  They didn't want to get sued for the recent overdose death of another one of their MM patients.  It has been nearly 6 months since I was discharged from their practice and I am back to where I was 15 years ago - In pain and unable to live a semi normal life.  This is BS.  You dont take on long term patients and then suddenly discharge them when the heat is on.  Dr. Sackstein is so unethical.  They lost over 400 patients from their 2 main offices.  We are still seriously considering legal action regarding the overdose death of a family member, who was also a patient.  It just seemed so funny that, the month after I shared the CONFIDENTIAL autopsy report with the NP, is when Sackstein decided to stop treating all Medication Management patients.  These PM doctors need to stand up for their patients and stop being so scared of losing their medical licenses.  Don't even get me started on this place.  The ONLY good thing about the place is the NP - Bill Biskup.  I truly hope he finds employment at another PM practice, where he is appreciated.",2024-04-25|2022-08-06|2020-03-12|2020-01-21|2022-10-15|2020-03-25|2016-08-30|2018-05-27,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do you accept Medicaid","Yes they do",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJPUFkbghfwYkRX3aK-68wcCw,36

No doctor does ablations as good as Dr. Ibrahim.|Amazing Treatment at this office and the front staff is always so polite and accommodating. The doctor is very knowledgeable and has been helping me through a hard journey. Highly recommend for anyone going through pain.|Dr. Ibrahim is a fabulous doctor. I used to wake up in the morning and the pain in my neck was so bad I had to count down from 10 to get myself ready to move. I then started setting my alarm 20 minutes early to take Advil so I could move, 20 minutes later when I had to get up for work. This went on for a few years. I tried PT but it was too painful. When my doctor told me about Dr. Ibrahim I made an appointment immediately. Dr. Ibrahim did an ablation which has something to do with the nerves. I remember waking up after a minor and painless procedure and I when I turned my head, I had no pain. After that I didn't have to set my alarm clock early. I was able to go back to the gym and do everything I used to do because of the procedure. About a year later, I started to have pain in my arm when I was lifting. I spoke to Dr. Ibrahim about it and he said it was tendinitis. He performed a procedure where he injected steroids in my elbow and upper thumb. The day after the procedure I tested my arm out with light weight and was amazed because I had no pain. I'm back at the gym lifting again and my trainer is amazed at how quickly I responded to the steroids. I wouldn't go to any other doctor. I tell  him where the pain is and he knows what is wrong and knows how to fix it. I'm so grateful that I have Dr. Ibrahim to fix whatever is wrong with my movement. I trust him and and recommend him to anyone who is having pain. He'll fix you like he fixed me. Thank you doc!!|I have had major back issues for 11 years.

The nurse that took me to room very professional and I asked question about procedure today, what was difference between this and last injection and he immediately checked and came back and came me easy to understand information, very thorough.  Much appreciated.  The nurses very friendly in procedure room and explained what they were doing.  The doctor or nurse practitioner friendly and explained what he was doing.   This staff is outstanding!!|My recent experience with the staff here at Southwest Pain Center are very professional and caring. They take the time to listen to you whatever your needs are and really understand your anxiety. Dr Ramirez went out of his way to come and meet me before my procedure. He listened to my fears and he calmed my anxiety. During the procedure he took the time to talk me through everything that was going to happen. Everyone in that room was very compassionate and caring. I came in very overwhelmed and I leave with the breath of fresh air. I highly recommend anyone who is living with pain to come and visit Southwest Pain CENTER.|Your reply was very polite. And your practice has probably changed since I went there. But you don't seem to understand that to your patients wait time is lobby plus exam room time. Your staff promised me a quick appointment, which I didn't receive. Then after being moved to your exam room I was again abandoned after a couple of cursory questions.
I don't know how big your lobby is so I don't know if half full is 3 people or 15. But my experience got the rating it deserved and I won't change it|My personal experience at Southwest Pain Center was smooth. Mr. Jose Luis Ramirez the anesthetist was extremely gentle with a warm bedside manner that kept me at ease and gave me comfort as I went the other lower back procedure. The crew Mr. Ramirez served as his assistants were calm and their affect was embracing as was Mr. Ramirez's.   Greatly appreciate their professionalism and their implicit respect and affect for me the patient. In gratitude, Rudolfo

This second review is provided after two vollies that served as ""test"" procedures. During this appointment , Dr. Ramirez preformed an RFA (Radio Frequency Ablation) on my lower back. I must say, Dr. Ramirez's has a healing hand when the needles began entering my lower back. Gentle. Soft and sure in touch. Always reassuring. His voice is strong but calm with a caring tone that provided me with comfort and a vision of healing. Because of Dr. Ramirez and his most able assistants they were consistent and unconditional worthy helpers. His medical assistants  Sonya (Radiologist), as well as Angelica and Erica were respectful and helpful to Dr. Ramirez and Sonya as well as my person. In between visit/check ins with Dina Rico out conversations were most helpful as I prepared for each treatment.

Southwest Pain Center is place for healing, for giving me the opportunity to take better of me as I in my later years traverse my life pain free.

My unconditional thanks to all at Southwest Pain Center.|2.5+ hours after our appointment, provider no-call / no-show.   We called in after waiting an hour and we were told there was 1 person ahead of us.  An hour later we called back, waited on hold for 20 minutes only to be told the provider left for the day.  No call, no show.   We didn't expect immediate service, but we didn't expect to be ignored and skipped for 2.5 hours in total.   Even with telehealth, people take time off work to deal with this stuff.   This provider is the least professional in terms of communication that I've dealt with so far.|Staff is very considerate and friendly. Helpful for your needs before and after your procedure. I would definitely recommend them to anyone that is looking for a new pain doctor. When you have a phone appointment they listen to all your needs and they take their time to figure out the best solution for you. I'm very satisfied with Southwest Pain Center.|Dr Ramirez and his staff are super amazing. They are very professional and truly care about you as a person. I have been in situations where I have received shots in my back and I had the doctor laughing and joking with their staff and talking about the weekend or the night before. Not very professional and not very comforting to the person laying face down on the table. I have always received the best care and the best consideration with this team. Choosing them you will not go wrong.|Hello everyone, since going in to the facility to my appointment everyone was so attentive. From the receptionist to the people in the back.

I have been in pain for over a year. No one hearing me. Offering Pain meds that just caused more issues than helped. I resorted to just living with it. I was referred to Sandia Pain Center and in my head just dreaded going. Assuming it would be a the same as all the rest.
Dr Bergsten sat down and really heard me . Within a couple weeks I had an additional appointment with him that, not to sound cliche, but changed everything. One procedure took away 95% of my pain. So much so that I didn't even realize how much pain I was in before. I am shocked every time I go to do a normal thing like standing up, emptying the dryer, taking my dog for a walk, etc. and I'm not in pain. It really brings tears to my eyes sometimes.
I cannot thank them enough. I will sing their praises to everyone.|Dr. Bergsten is an anomaly and a one of a kind doctor!! He is kind, compassionate and he truly cares about how you are feeling!

From the moment I walked into his office, it was clear how deeply he cares about his patients. He takes the time to listen, asks thoughtful questions, and ensures every concern is addressed with patience and expertise. His genuine compassion and dedication shine through in every interaction.

What truly sets Dr. Manole apart is his thoroughness. He leaves no stone unturned, meticulously reviewing details and explaining diagnoses or treatment plans in a way that's easy to understand. Whether it's a routine check-up or a complex issue, you can trust he'll go the extra mile to provide the best care possible.

He is technically at the top of the Neurological field while at the same time possessing and demonstrating keen insight into his patients experiences and relationships.  My wife and I recommend him to any and everyone experiencing pain and/or spine problems.|Mixed messages and unsound clinical decision making by a provider who is known to staff to have poor rapport with patients. This provider suggested re-prescribing to me a medication that has caused nausea, vomiting, and an allergic rash that is currently spread across my trunk.

I expressed serious concern about continuing a medication that makes me sick, especially when I'm already sick. We go to specialists to benefit from their expertise and education, not to have more harm done to our bodies, not to sit in front of burnt out and unfeeling providers who make us fight for dignity.

I'm a healthcare provider, too. One who experiences chronic pain and has difficulty caring for her own patients. Rather than partnering with me in my care, Modern Pain and Spine had me sit in a waiting room to get a second opinion about the rash by a physician who never showed up, and instead sent a staff member to deliver the message, ""We're not prescribing you anything else, you should go home.'

This is not a place of healing or empowerment-- it's a place where desperate people go to ask for help and instead receive shame and suspicion of addiction. I worry that the clinicians here are doing active harm.|My husband had his first visit today for a pinched nerve and all of the staff were excellent--extremely knowledgeable, professional, friendly and efficient.  They completed a thorough exam and explained what would be needed going forward. They worked us in for a pain intervention the same day which was greatly appreciated because we live out of town. This is an excellent clinic and I would highly recommend it for back pain.|The practice is well organized and well staffed. Dr. Manole is very knowledgeable and works closely with his people to make sure things are done right. This is not my first time at this practice and I can tell it got better over time. They ard enthusiastic to make people feel better. I have a problematic right knee, and when I left the clinic it already felt a great deal better.
Thank you Dr. Manole and staff!|Never have I been so upset with healthcare workers. My father, who is disabled and suffers from severe pain, has been seeing doctors at Modern Pain and Spine for a while now. Today, as his daughter, I've never been more frustrated. I took him to his appointment for his routine knee injections, which are essential for managing his pain. But after waiting over three hours, he finally came out and shared his awful experience. Not only had they scheduled him with the wrong person for the injections, but they made him wait for far too long and ignored him while he was in pain. To make matters worse, he told me that a bald man got in his face and said, ""my shit level is high today,"" before aggressively giving him the injections and walking out without saying anything else.

They show true concern , empathy, compassion, and care for the patients that they treat. They always make my visit easy and pleasant and meaningful. I truly appreciate the care they provide, and I definitely don't mind driving three hours to see them.|Talk about incompetent...so bad its scary! Maybe they do better doling out meds but if you actually need a procedure, this is NOT the place to go! Besides they will take the appointment and then send you to Albuquerque anyway. No one there has any clue what they are doing and the doctor, who seemed half awake told me and my wife I needed one procedure then after 3 weeks waiting to have the procedure, he backtracks on everything he told us. It looks like a pill mill and perhaps that's what it is! Big clue was when we went there for a spinal injection and they made me pee in a cup. Should have run for the door then and there. We live we learn.|Dr. Skardis and his team provide excellent detailed care. He is also dedicated to
patient education providing detailed videos so one can better understand their condition.

When I spoke the receptionist, she was rude, unhelpful & didn't formally answer the phone, instead just with a simple ""hello"" -- quite unprofessional for what these people bill...

You took an oath to help people -- not only the rich...

There are likely many other people that have suffered because of your greed & lack of proper access.|Sam, I'm sorry that you found your call with our receptionist confusing. I apologize. Apparently, you were looking for pain management in the form of oral prescription pain medication. We do not prescribe oral pain drugs. We specialize in interventional pain management - injection procedures to help with pain, particularly PRP Stem Cell injections to repair structures in joints. Perhaps our office manager mentioned that we suggest various supplements or natural medicines for oral administration instead of pain drugs.

He takes the time to assess you and then provides clinic support treatments that really work. He is kind and listens. The clinic is efficient and everyone working there is knowledgeable and understanding. We are so lucky to have this doctor and the IPA clinic in New Mexico!|WOW, at first I had a great impression about my first visit with Dr.  Raiten and my follow up injection. Today I had a follow up video appointment to assess the  results of my procedure, and I was surprised to find out that it was with his PA named Maria. She seemed credible and polite until I mentioned that for the future I would like to keep my care with Dr.  Raiten just for the fact that I don't feel comfortable of having a third person involved in my care. Maria politely yet assertively told me that I did not have that option and if this did not work for me, she'd be more than happy to refer me to another group.
A few minutes later I called the office to verify the information I had just received, was transferred to the office manager named Katie whose level of unprofessionalism and rudeness was surreal. She actually sounded unwell when she brought up that by ""not trusting Maria's competency as a PA, I was breaking a contract I signed with the office to be COURTEOUS with the staff, and for that I was being rude"". Not for a second did I challenge Maria's qualifications as a physician's assistant, instead I stressed my preference of  seeing Dr Raiten primarily.
I was NEVER told beforehand that there was another doctor in the office who I was going to be switched to. Katie also told me that this was HER office, since she was the doctor's wife, and that she would suggest for me to find another pain medical group.
The treatment I received from this office's gatekeepers today lacks professionalism, respect and definitely class from the ""doctor's wife"" who sounded more like an unbalanced disgruntled employee. Not the kind of bedside manners I expect from a professional clinic.
I'll definitely share my experience with others and with my primary care physician who sent me to Dr. Raiten and spoke so highly of him.|Excellent experience.  Welcoming and accommodating staff were professional as well as accomodating. Each communicated Cogently.  Dr.R was excellent as well. demonstrating positive regard while performing a skilled exam.

I will let everyone know about him, if they ever have need of him and if I ever need someone again in the future there is no doubt as to where I'll be going. Thank you so so much to all of you and for making my worse experience more bearable.|I appreciate Dr. Berti and  his staff. They were extremely nice and after the injection I definitely feel like I'm closer recovery than ever before. Thank you for your care!!|Twice I have called there to set up a new patient appt. Twice they have transferred me to their intake line. Twice I've left vm's to call me back to set it up and I have never received a call. Guess I'm going to have to find another doctor. This place doesn't care.|Great place! Went there with neck and back pain, got my injections done and now I am pain free. Staff is really nice, especially, Ms. Veronica, she really goes out of her way to help you. I would recommend this place highly! Respectfully. Ms. Agnes.|Dr. Berti was very informative and patient explaining my needed procedure to alleviate my back pain as a direct result from my motor vehicle accident. I am grateful for his knowledge and measured approach to my healthcare.|I have been receiving  treatment here for a personal injury case and these people are amazing. The staff is so friendly and educated. They have helped me tremendously with my pain. Highly recommended, the atmosphere is also very calming and relaxing. Super clean too. Don't go anywhere else, you won't regret it.|I was in a car accident the beginning of June. I had a concussion and whiplash. My back, neck, right shoulder and my head hurt so much I couldn't function.  My head hurt so badly that I couldn't stand sound, movement, or light. I couldn't open my eyes unless lighting was dim.  Couldn't rest, sit, stand, work, drive. NOTHING!  I'm a highly active person and I never get sick. That accident flipped my world completely up side down. I was referred to ALB Pain management and spine care soon after I was hurt. They got me in quickly. I don't remember my first couple appointments with them other then how caring , gentle and professional they all were.  I received injections in my spine from the Dr. at ALB.  Before that appointment I was so scared. I had so many fears about it, I almost didn't do it.but I did.  This staff really cares and it shows.  They explained everything step by step .I felt well informed and comforted. I received the injection in my spine about 2 months after the accident.The 12th of August. After getting the injections, slowly I get up from the bed and was asked if I was OK.  I kinda started to cry, I just realized that I hadn't, up until this moment, ever made eye contact with any of them. I only new them by there shoes.  Now for the first time I was making eye contact with them.  Amazing!  It's now the end of September, 3 1/2 months after the accident.  My life is getting back to normal quickly.  I owe my quick recovery to the wonderful staff and Dr.'s at ALB Pain management and spine care.  Without them, my recovery would have taken YEARS!

The appointments were usually on time, no long waits. Today my sister's appoint is 1 hour and 15 minute waiting time, last visit was 1 hour wait for morning appointments. The staff in the back are not much help, with no empathy. Patients are literally here for pain, and this waiting time is too long for them.

Dr. Rumbaugh is empathetic, professional, and personable. Their phlebotomist is a hoot, and very good at her job. My favorite receptionist (like ever!) is Holly. Holly always has a smile for me, a kind greeting, and takes a genuine interest in me - beyond being just another face. I'd recommend this clinic to anyone who has suffered from bad treatment elsewhere. They truly care about patients, and I'm thrilled to have found them.|I went for an appt today at 9am got there at 8:30 at 10:15 am I still wasn't seen! I decided to reschedule because I had to go to work!!! There was a rude lady in the front rolling her eyes while she was stuffing her mouth with fruit loops, as I asked to speak to a manager! I wanted to know what the purpose was to draw blood every visit!!! Just seems like they want to use up a persons medical insurance everytime for everything, welp nope I will definitely not approve there  process!
Last they have these signs that states they will not tolerate vulgar language etc but they definitely won't respect the patient care time and insurance!!! Just saying|So far, I have visited this clinic several times. The doctor and tech staff behind the scenes have been great so far. The front desk and the administrative end is a train wreck. Overly long paperwork that asks the same questions I answered previously is one example. Sending an option to do it online in a not timely manner and holding me hostage to answer the redundant questions that are a waste of time if you actually processed the previous responses. This makes you feel like you are being tested to see if you are lying between one questionnaire to another. If this end of things cleans up significantly they could be at least 4 stars.

I just visited again on 10/9/24. I showed up for my appointment only to get told the appointment was not authorized and so I wouldn't be seen. Mind you I got multiple reminders about my appointment, which was good, but nobody on their end contacted me to cancel it and not completely waste my time. This is again where the admin side of things is clearly still an issue.|Dr Raumbaugh and his staff are always so kind. I truly appreciate all he has done to make my migraines more manageable. He's very knowledgeable and always seems un rushed and truly cares about his patients.|I went into the Pain Center with very little hope. I have had migraines for 25 years. Frequent, chronic, severe,  debilitating migraines. I've seen dozens of doctors, had lots of treatments and medications. Dr. Watkins suggested a procedure that took less than an hour. I have only had 2 migraines since then. I am happy with the Pain Center, to say the least. Thank you NMPC!|For years, I was actually impressed with what quality of care I got here until things recently took a turn for the worse. My specialist did not renew his DEA license in time. During that time, no one would call me back to see what other doctor could refill my prescription. I called multiple times begging for help only to be ignored and neglected. I ended up switching to a methadone program because I didn't know where else to turn. You can't just have someone relying on medication for years and expect everything to be fine if they're suddenly unable to get that. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise. The relief I got from this clinic was barely cutting it anymore. Methadone is more efficient. All that being said, this clinic usually does a good job. I have recommended this place to several others. My specialist was one of the only people who seemed to ever believe me about my pain and listen to me about my concerns. I will miss working with him.

I'll make this short! Don't bother! They look for ways to not help you. I received a bill today for my urinalysis that was done at the office. Obviously they couldn't figure out how to bill the insurance co. When my urine was negative the Nurse Practitioner you see started bringing up medications I took two months ago to refuse me medication.
Avoid the stupidity and agrivation!
Go to a DOCTOR.
And yes they treat you like a junkie and accuse you of Dr. Shipping even if you were referred!|Always so thorough and nice I can always count on empty waiting rooms no wait times it's great in and out pain free I'm in I was struggling in so much pain everyday my knees need replacement and so do both shoulders it's a lot of pain and no one wanted to deal with me because of my multiple diagnosis   So thank you so much for being my Angels to help me when I had no one to turn to. Best clinic Ever.|Front desk receptionist was very nice and Dr. Cotto was also very nice and professional as well as his assistant. Overall I will be seeing them for as long as possible and look forward to it.|Dr. Grossete is absolutely amazing. He has the best bedside manner I've seen. He really takes his time with my mom. And it's super appreciated. Always has a smile to give and enjoys my mom's humor. He's extremely knowledgeable and knows what he's doing. Front desk people are always a pleasure. Still fairly new operation, but definitely not new to the practice.|Angela is so awesome, she listens and addresses all my concerns.|Dr Morris met with my wife's grandmother and gave her an honest and detailed plan to help improve her health.  He was great as listening to her, making her feel comfortable and being empathetic, qualities her previous doctors were lacking.  Compassionate care can be difficult to come by, glad we found it in Dr Morris.|When my primary gave me my referral to New Mexico Center for pain and wellness I was quite surprised that I got a call from  Abigail scheduling  so quickly. she scheduled me for an appointment, so my first appointment was with Dr. Andrea she listen to what I had to say, and looked at my medical records and started helping me with my pain management. A few appointments later I had to have a video appointment and it was with Dr. Barazo, I was quite shocked with our appointment. He was rude extremely judge mental, and he also forgot to take care of my pain medication. This was during the Christmas holidays so I couldn't get a hold of anyone in the office to get my medication's taken care of, so after the holidays, I called the office and spoke to Abigail and she told me I apologize. Please let me get in touch with my office manager, Chrystina well that office handled it and I mean handled it . Chrystina called me apologized for the rudeness of that human being and that the patient always comes first. then also told me that she had a new doctor for me to see and his name is Dr. Mark Grossetete. so I went into my appointment with this new doctor the nurse taking care of my vitals and asking if I was OK and anything to be concerned about did she needs to let the doctor know , she is quite caring and understanding and listens to me that something that is very stellar about her and I wish I knew her name at the next appointment. I'll make sure, I have it won't forget,,,,,,,anyway  when he  Dr Grossetete  walked into the room, you could just feel a very caring , astute And extremely nonjudgmental feeling about him. He listen to my issues and is fixing my issues actually better than any other physician ever. I talk to him about some other things that I felt that needed to be addressed and he brought in a wonderful therapist. Via video ,Dr Christy Crews is amazing I didn't realize that I needed and wanted to put a mental therapist in my life and I am so grateful that New Mexico pain and wellness center is taking care of all my needs. Yeah I had a bump in the road with Dr. BARAZO but again that was all handled immediately.|******************************************************************RESPONSE FROM ""OWNER"" : I'm sorry to hear this. Our clinic must follow policies which was done by our NP. If there is anything that we can help you with please feel free to contact out office.

1) NOTE that the response noted that even with information below, you stated that your NP followed your policies. This response is defensive and does not acknowledge nor show any documentation showing if our interpretation is in error. Which I would gladly accept. An example below is provided for you to investigate to better serve your patients. hopefully prompting a review. The response disregards this completely and offers no information other than ""We followed procedures"". If you would provide a contact other than ""our office"" I would be glad to sit down and discuss the issues.

DO NOT GO HERE! Nurse Practitioner would NOT help with an anomaly that showed up in urine test. Their response was to immediately cease any further help. Stating the patient agreement. HOWEVER, the agreement states that if an issue is observed that the patient will be put on a closely monitored program with the intent to build trust with the Dr/Patient. THIS WAS REFUSED! They didnt even follow THEIR OWN PROCEDURES! Furthermore the NP scolded us and said ""Ive spent too much time with you already"" After communicating my frustration and mentioning I suffer from the aftereffects of a Traumatic Brain Injury. She responded with ""I know people with brain injuries and they dont act like YOU!"" In addition, She said my pleading and frustration was ""abhorent"" behavior.

He has done two cervical facet injection trials on me and then a bilateral cervical radio frequency ablation. All the while, he maintained lines of communication, informing me of everything he did as he was doing it. He answered all my questions in a non-condescending manner. He was aware of the unique way in which natural red heads metabolize pain medications (including opioids) differently from non-red heads and he adjusted dosing appropriately. He explained everything to me so that I understood. He is highly skilled, highly educated, and I would recommend his practice to anyone suffering from chronic neck and back pain like me. The rest of the staff at New Mexico Pain Associates was also very professional and caring. The medical assistant helping me today was Gabby, and she was a gem. She talked to me throughout the whole process, stayed with me when I asked her to, and brought me an ice pack for comfort following my procedure. She helped me feel comfortable and heard. It's a rare thing to be treated so well when all too often these days patients are gaslit and made to feel invisible.

Just a little background. I have had back issues since I was 14. I was diagnosed with 6 vertabrea in my lower back, normal is five. They called it a normal abnormality. This has exacerbated through the years. I now have scoliosis, 10 compression fractures. I have a Medtronic's nerve stimulator installed in my back. Unfortunately, I am no stranger to pain.

This fracture was INTENSE!

I didn't get to see the DR,  the PA came into see me. She's 6' and probably weighs 300 lbs. she came in, stood over me and crossed her arms. VERY INTIMIDATING!!

ANYONE OUT THERE WITH CHRONIC PAIN THATS NOT DEPRESSED??

I, honestly don't know what I did to cause this woman not to like me?  Is it because I'm very white?  She was overbearing and rude!  Absolutely no compassion or consideration for me whatsoever!!  I think she's also a bully!

I had another MRI at another well known facility about a month ago. There is no comparison regarding the interaction with the staff. Advanced Pain and Neurology staff were superior to my ""other experience"". They were professional, courteous, answered my questions and made me feel comfortable. I couldn't be more happy with my experience! These guys were awesome!|The experience at Advance Pain Neurology/ABQ MRI has been great! The hospitality is amazing with warm welcoming from Grace, Faren, Jaqui, and along with the Doctors. Also everyone in the facility is amazing as well. They gave me helpful information towards my recovery/diagnosis. The environment is very well managed and clean all around. The atmosphere is very calming. The knowledge that has been given along with the treatments is helpful. The first day they do tell you that this will be a process that takes time. Just know in due time all the appointments will help me get back on track. This is definitely a facility that values their patients and put them first when they arrive and when they leave. The reminders of the appointments are well structured where it makes it easy for my appointment. Overall it's an amazing facility that if you're recovering I would definitely recommend checking it out! Great experience! :)
Gerry|When I first came in, I wasn't the best patient I should been. They have been great with rescheduling me for at least 3 weeks prior to me actually coming in. They even scheduled me a 4th time after I had come in on the wrong date
The staff is very professional and kind, helpful and I would recommend them to anyone who requires an MRI. I spoke with Grace in beginning in reassuring me I was in good hands. And I was ok.  faran was great in making sure I would be fine in tube.  Fantastic oldie music is my favorite.|I was so damaged after my auto accident, I thought I would never recover. When my regular doctors referred my to this clinic of strangers I worried I would have big bills and no real help. I was wrong, thankfully!

This clinic has a large stable of providers with different specialties, and everything is handled at this address, from assessments through treatments and follow up. Everyone treated me with compassion, even when I was grumpy or confused. They offered me only the most efficient treatments that would help, and it worked! I already feel recovered, and I have hope for my future again. I am most grateful!

Also, I think everyone there is bilingual. Spanish speakers will be heard there, just as I was.|Everyone is very friendly and kind. The office environment is clean and well decorated.

After speaking to several colleagues in the medical field and making some aware of my upcoming appt at LCPC I was bombarded with negative feedback. This is unfortunate because I was looking forward for a second opinion. I came online in hopes of a different answer and noticed so many negative reviews. I was also made aware, this facility is the same company as New Mexico Pain Center on Northrise. With all of this said, I will not be making it to my appointment with this facility|Currently sitting in the parking lot awaiting for a call since the inside of the office is OVERFILLED with patients waiting to be seen. Patients sitting on the floor, standing along the wall and stair case. Elderly patients standing and relying on canes to while waiting this long is ridiculous. Appointment was for 10:30, I arrived at 10:15. It is now 11:33 and I have not been seen. In the documents you sign when first being registered, is a notice for the patient stating you will be fined for being late. My question is what happens when you are awaiting over an 1.5 hours  to be seen? Communicating with other patients who are seen on a regular basis, this is sadly a constant way things are run here. Before COVID-19 this was a main issue they faced which continues now. Fasting for the procedure and adding an hour to and from for commute just adds to the dysfunction. Being told after going inside there were 7, 30min - 1hr procedures ahead of mine. This meant I would be at this facility until the afternoon waiting to be seen. There needs to be some order for future patients/clients.
The front staff is less than helpful and they rather blame the patient than fix the issue of double booking or booking patients in time slots which are unrealistic since they are not being seen or being seen later than the intended time given when the appointment was made. An office place needs administrators that will train employees to be accountable and work together to help the clients that arrive to this facility. It is not about how many clients you can get in a day for a payment but how to efficiently help those coming in through your doors and getting them the medical care they are needing which is what brought them to your facility in the first place .
EDIT:
If you cannot serve the amount of people you book, because again 2 hours and a half after the appointment time is ridiculous, you should recommended them to another facility. Yes these patients are in pain and should be given the respect of timeliness, that this facility is expecting from the individuals being seen.|The waiting room is frequently so filled, patients arriving for pain management had to stand around the waiting room.

I am a pain specialist but live in Scottsdale and desperately needed someone in Albuquerque to help my elderly mother with her pain. As a pain specialist myself, I wanted nothing but the best treatment for my mother, as I'm sure everyone else would as well. Dr. Smith came highly recommended from a family member, so I scheduled my mom to see him and WOW did he help her so much! It's so nice to know there's someone out of state that I can trust to give my mother top quality care and immense help with her pain. Thank you so much Dr Smith for taking care of my mom when I can't. I am so grateful to you and absolutely recommend you to anyone who is looking for pain relief for themselves or for a family member or friend.

Every time I go to see him, I can get a complete relaxation treatment, and the pain in my body is completely gone!

He is a regular chiropractor but claims  To be a Naprapath. I left feeling the same my pain came back within the same week. He didn't give my fiance a full hour that we paid for. Wouldn't recommend this guy just a quick fix so you can keep hurting and keep paying. Just like a chiropractor.|I went by earlier today during posted operating hours. There was a sign on the door that said ""Closed, will return at (what appeared to be) 11:30"" Totally understandable if someone was on lunch or something and was a few minutes late. I was in that building from 1:45 to 2:00pm and no one was there. That's unacceptable. I would have loved to become a patient and learn more about naprapathy and it's approach to pain management, see if it might help. Not after today, which is a shame because it looks like a nice practice, in a very unique building.|I went to see Dr Smith today with a pinched nerve in my back, I could barely move. He fixed me all up in ONE session, no pain at all anymore. I'm very thankful, and I highly recommend!!|Love this place , Dr. Smith provides amazing customer service.

Horrendous. Went first time with CD 1.5 yrs old. Dr Watkins says ,oh this is too old, go get another MRI. Got another MRI and he waltzes in and says, severe deterioration , increased since last time, too old for surgery ..then.."" I'm leaving "". As in leaving the practice.
Then He says, "" Viya con Dios"". Done. Are you kidding me!?!! Some guy supposedly coming  up in the future to see patients. They are overwhelmed and could give a shit.
*******    I DID RETURN... the Dr. now is Dr. Vasquez. He had good bedside manner, listened well, discussed MRI results and current medications. We decided on a treatment for next month. We will see. He comes over from Texas  once a month amd even brought some of his staff from Texas. This  was a MUCH more hopeful, professional, educational visit. The staff was extremely friendly as well. . I do believe in giving people and places second chances.|Dr. John Watkins is an absolutely amazing doctor. He truly cares about his patience and their care! His staff is equally amazing and I am blessed to have Dr. Watkins and his team taking care of my pain management. He has never pushed me to do procedures that I can not afford as i do not have insurance. He does everything to take care of me and he has put me on a new medication that has helped my RSD like no other doctors have. I am so happy to be off all the pain and nerve medication that didn't help me, just ""got"" me through the day. Now i live a fulfilling life thanks to his care! If you are in need of a great pain management doctor, this is the doctor to see. I drive 2 hours one way to see him and I will never change my doctor unless he retires! Thank you, Dr. Watkins and your staff for the amazing treatments I receive from you and your staff!|The staff is amazing. I always feel better after seeing them. They take blood with no pain and they always have a smile, asking how i'm doing. Judith is so easy to talk with. Doctor. Watkins and i are on the same page/team in trying several methods of improving my pain. Exercise, meds, nutrition. What a great pain doc! Thank you all! Keith|I have a lot of nervous system issues with pain and other neurological symptoms. The medical system in general has conditioned me to keep it to myself and not make doctor appointments because its a complicated mess of issues and most doctors stop listening or get frustrated if the explanation of symptoms is longer than a sentence. Dr. Watkin's was incredibly kind and empathetic and really listened to my issue and seemed to be knowledgable about what I was dealing with and some solutions for long term treatments as well as short term treatments. The nurse was just as great. Feeling more optimistic about the future for the first in a while and glad I got a referral to go here.|From the very beginning I have had nothing but a wonderful experience with The New Mexico Pain Center, in particular Dr. Watkins. I had seen 2 previous doctors, who totally misdiagnosed what was causing my pain. He ordered an MRI which was able to show what was causing the pain. He and his staff have been wonderful in helping me to find the proper surgery I needed as well finding the perfect neurosurgeon and hospital. I am forever grateful to them for finding the cause of my pain and offering me a new perspective on life. Thank you Dr. Watkins!|I am a frail 75 year-old woman with severe osteoporosis and scoliosis who had a Vertaflex procedure performed by Dr John Watkins in January 2023. It was an amazing success. I had had pinched nerves for decades. By surgically placing spacers between L3-L4 and L4-L5, the pain was relieved dramatically. I was walking the next day. Prior to the surgery, I had been walking with the help of trekking poles to help stabilize my steps and I no longer use them at all!

The staff are incredibly kind, decent, good, and true. I really, really like how well they all get along with each other. I can't thank Dr Watkins enough for his incredible care. He's my hero.|I have chronic pain and recently moved from California to Santa Fe. I wanted to keep my pain med routine. I met with Dr Watkins at New Mexico Pain Center and I was very impressed with Dr Watkins' calmness. He made several valid suggestions for my pain management care that I was very excited about. In addition, the staff that works at New Mexico Pain Center are top notch. I'm really looking forward to working with Dr Watkins and the New England Mexico Pain Center.!!!!!!!!|I had been seeing dr. Watkins over the course of 5 months. I had called to schedule a  new appointment with him. I felt as though I was being integrated by Raina. I had to defend the unbearable pain - I sometimes get. I was made to feel like like I was drug seeking. The clerical staff was beyond unprofessional. Raina was obviously picking a fight with me over the phone. She discharged me immediately. Because they wanted me to respond negatively. I did indeed call her a B at that point. Don't be fooled by their website. I am only ONE of the MANY they discharge so easily. After pleading my case to the manager  Misty I quickly realized there was zero point in doing so. It became abundantly clear that I was not going to be listed to. My request to speak to dr. Watkins was denied. No surprise there. I found out that once you are discharged from ONE clinic - you are dismissed from the rest. I would have been willing to travel to Albuquerque.

Made us feel welcome. However, when we got into office it was a completely different experience.. The girls at reception hardly seem to know what they're doing, they seem frantic and rude, didn't even ask for my dads pharmacy.

Thank you all!|There is 1 goofball here that is still burdening their coworkers and patients with mask-wearing as we approach the year 2025.

I kindly ask you to stop depriving your practice of facial expressions and smiles. I challenge you to consider that the masks being worn by your patients and coworkers aren't sufficient to accomplish anything. Nobody else is still engaged in this laughable measure.

It's an oppressive and cumbersome reminder of a shameful time; a filthy bacterial petri dish that lets the bulk of them pass on through. Meanwhile--you're breathing exhaust.

Aerosol's travel through our air, atmosphere, the breeze, and those tiny spaces in fabric. Consider the impact breathing one's own moist, bacterial exhaust has on a person. Consider that nobody in your building is keeping that mask on constantly because they don't want to wear that thing.

Your coworkers don't want to wear a mask. It's obvious. I'll bet your patients don't either. Are you thinking of them, or only of yourself? Why are we having to live and behave like diseased filthy animal after 1000's of years surviving on this planet? This a political manipulation, not an effective health precaution long-term.

The rest of the world around this building has learned something and moved on.

How do you get to work? How do you buy food? How did you survive before 2020? Certainly you're not a bubble-person. Come on back down to earth. We're waiting for you with smiles.|Arrived 10 minutes early for my appointment to a crowded waiting area. I watched it empty and refill, people after me come and gone. While waiting an elderly man came in, was addressed by name by staff, he said his conditioning repair man was coming and he couldn't be late getting home. About an hr after I arrived was I taken to a room. I told the staff I was almost an hour after my appointment, that my time was as important as Dr.s. I was told 'we are short staffed' I waited 20 more minutes and I hear the older gentleman in the next room. Dr. is in the room to left and the older gentleman to my rt. Next I hear Dr talking with the older man, skipped past me, I walked out 1:15 minutes past my appointment. Never did see the Dr. and canceled all appointments, won't be back.

He's empathic, knowledgeable, kind and competent!
I have to pay out of pocket since my insurance isn't contracted with his clinic, but his prices are fair. For example he's charging $150 for 3 or more triggers point injections. Lovelace downtown tried to charge me over $2000 for the same procedure. It really shows you how much certain hospitals are milking patients for $$$$, but not this clinic. Also his fee schedule for all procedures is accessible for anyone to look at, and not intentionally opaque and confusing like most hospitals. Great place and great doctor!|Full pockets for him, permanent damage for me.
This guy is a player.  He will tell you anything you want to hear in order to keep you coming back to his office.  He did the one thing a health care provider should never do. He told me he would make my pain go away.  I believed him.
I saw him 3 times.  He tried something different every time.  The third time, he JABBED the needle into the wrong spot on my neck.  He of course blew it off, so I tried not to worry about it.  I now have a pain going down the left side of my neck that is worse than the pain I was seeing him for!
Every single person that works in that office is unfriendly and miserable.  That right there should have told me what kind of person he is.
When I asked for pain medication, I was told I'd have to come in monthly.  Guess his wife must be a big spender.  Gotta keep the bank account full!

Thank you, Dr. Craig Nairn, for being the epitome of excellence in pain management. Your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of your patients is truly commendable. I am forever grateful for the exceptional care you have provided me.|I have been a customer of Dr. Narin for more than 6 years now, and I don't really have any issues or complaints. The hours they are open are perfect for me.

Yes, sometimes I have a little difficultie getting an appointment at the exact time I want one, but the office staff work diligently to get me an appointment as close to my preferred time and day as possible.

The office staff are as polite and knowledgeable as I could ever want or need.

Whenever I have any questions I can get them answered in the office during my appointment, over the phone any time I call, or through the 'Patient Portal' (any time of the day or night).

Unfortunately, there aren't enough Doctors, and staff, like him and his support staff around these days! That's the only issue I actually have. But, I specifically request,  enjoy, and prefer, seeing Dr. Elizabeth. She has a very long (for me) and hard to remember and pronounce last name. I've NEVER found another doctor that is as knowledgeable, caring, hard working, dedicated, friendly, understanding or all around genuinely compassionate as she is! Her smile and kind words never slip or falter . . . because they are equally as genuine as the rest of her and her energy is so welcoming, healing and powerful . . . I NEVER leave her office feeling beat~down, unheard, not listened to, made to feel bad about myself or the help I need, or made to feel tiny, ignorant, insignificant or like I should be grateful that a doctor is willing to even squeeze me into their schedule! Dr. Elizabeth is more than just a daily refreshing breath of air or a kind smile, she's real, empathetic and genuine.
Sandra B.
Albuquerque, NM|Dr. Nairn has a bedside manner unrivaled by any doctor I've personally visited. He's empathetic, caring, an active listener, and as a former anesthesiologist, a pain expert.

Pain Solution's PA, Elizabeth, is an excellent health care provider as well. Elizabeth is kind, a good listener, and focused on providing the best care.

Both Dr. Nairn and Elizabeth take the field of pain medicine seriously and always share information on the latest medical updates related to my conditions each time I have an appointment.|Was able to see Dr. Nairn within a week and a half. He is very good and very personable. Hard to find both sometimes! I received a cervical steroid injection. Quick, painless and now I am pain free.
Full disclosure however. They were not contracted with my insurance company but don't let that deter you. I will bill my own insurance and collect what they pay. It was well worth it. You can't put a price on being pain free!  I highly recommend Pain solutions.

Pacheco is fantastic but will not be handling pain management service in 3 months from December '24... He's been so great. Now to find someone else....|They try to charge you $80 for a missed appointment...even if they fail to send out the appointment reminders.

Have a meeting last minute, they don't care.

Have a class that runs longer than normal, and you needed to be there for a grade and completion of a lab...they don't care.

Essentially, they do good work...however, it's all about them and only they matter, you are just a number.

When there, they are nice enough people...but their efficiency and operational fortitude are meh.|UPDATE: 8/31st. it's been 2 weeks and still no returned call to reschedule my appointment.  Not that I would anyway. However,  I have received an $80 bill for services NOT rendered. Can you say...inept, unprofessional, irresponsible, and just downright annoying!

I was referred through my doctor. It took 10 weeks to get an appointment. I received several appointment reminders through email and texts, none of which mentioned to call into the office 1.5 hours ahead of my appointment time to confirm arrival. Once I arrived for my appointment,  I was informed I had missed my check-in time. I advised I was never informed about a call-in time. I was informed I would have to call back and reschedule. I'm standing there face to face, but I have to call in. The receptionist was being given these instructions from some anonymous person off to the side. Having waited 10 weeks pain medication-free, because I could not even book an appointment until I was off my current meds with no refills pending, on a triple-digit degree day and in severe pain, I returned home and called back. I was told the scheduler was not available and I had to leave a message. I have been waiting 1 week now for the office to call me to reschedule my appointment.  Meanwhile, I am still without any pain medication. The appropriate response would have been for them to apologize for THEIR mistake,  and seen to it that a new appointment date was a top priority.  This is all very unprofessional and I will be searching for another clinic.|I have been seen for 3+ years here. The staff on Pacheco and Dr Rice side are always so awesome and helpful! Dr Pacheco and Rice both are great and have always listened to me when I would explain things going wrong. I see Pacheco for pain management and I see Dr Rice for injections. I was sent from Academy Orthopedic which each and every one of these Drs have helped me so much! I still have pain but it's being managed. They don't make you feel like you are crazy or lying they try to get to the bottom of what is going on and why. I'm very thankful for this office and everyone who works there. I see some negative reviews and wonder if they are seriously talking about the same place I am. I have never had issues or anyone rude to me at this clinic. If I could rate with more  stars I would.|My Mom is a patient at this office and Dr Rice is an excellent Doctor.  I went into the appointment with my 88 year old mother and Dr Rice was very kind, very optimistic,  and has an excellent bedside manner.  He carefully explained all of her options and, he spoke to mother and not me.   His nurse also is very kind and helpful and respectful.   The only drawback is the receptionist.   I heard her yelling at my mother on the phone prior to her appointment,  she was very gruff when we checked in, and she was rudely talking about my mom which I could plainly hear through the glass.  Would we see Dr Rice again?  Without a doubt!  Somebody just needs to train the receptionist that she is the first point of contact and is 100% in customer service.|My grandma has been very sick lately and  went into heart failure and now her kidneys are not functioning right. I have been taking care of her dealing with all her stuff. I mixed up my appointment that was today thinking it was Friday called to cancel and was told your appointment is today and Dr Rice won't want to see you again. I said my grandma is sick I am sorry I have proof I mixed it up on the day please don't do this. She told me basically in a rude way oh well in more words then that. It's sad doctors can treat patients this way and throw them away like trash when I was just going for radiofrequency and not pain medication so it wasn't like I Violated some contact. I was discriminated against since I have a sick grandma and also I believe because I was told by them they check your financial worthiness to see if you got to pay upfront and I think they pick and choose who to keep. It's fine I know my rights I will be contacting the proper people to report this treatment. To bad because Dr Rice seemed nice at first and skilled but he obviously is in it for the money and not how patients feel or if things are not perfect and exact he throws you away. It's a shame and his front desk lady is rude in a passive aggressive way. Not like she has a hard Job anyone could do her job so I'm not to sure why she behaves that way. I would not recommend this place because you will get thrown away once you miss one appointment by mistake or can't meet their financial worthiness criteria. And this is why the United states has such crappy doctors and medical services because doctors do whatever they want, Dr Rice is prime example.|Run don't walk to a different pain clinic.
Dr Rice is rude, unprofessional, didn't listen to my pain issues, scheduled me for a nerve ablation without any pain relief and his front office staff are almost as rude as Dr. Rice. I changed pain clinics  and I love my doctors and their staff. There are many pain docs now a days so pick anyone but here.

She focused on my back. I told her I was not asking for help with my back, I have an excellent orthopedist who takes care of it. She insisted I needed procedures on my back and wanted to schedule for the next week for Dr Rice to do these procedures. I thought to myself no way is a stranger working on my back. She got up to make my appointment with Dr Rice. I said wait a minute, what about my hip?  She said it was probably nothing. She was rude and unprofessional with a narcissistic personality.
As it turned out, it was a really big something, requiring a 6 hour surgery to repair, months of intense rehab, and 2.5 months post op still using a walker so as not to put weight on my hip.

My life after cancer has been markedly more slow and frustrating.  I am not agreeable to much. And labeled often. I take pain  medication very seriously and as a last resort. I'm grateful for the ablation and medication. I hope one day my chronic pain will dissipated as seamlessly as it came. In the meantime I will continue to work diligently pushing myself in occupational therapy, in gentle exercise, in eating responsibly, in remembering to take my pain meds and talk therapy. One day I will ride my horse again. Thank you dr g|My mother in law came to see Dr. Gonzalez for a shot for pain relief. He was immediately rude to her and asked her what she was there for, as if he had no clue already. She said that she wasn't sure, the Doctor then said where would you like your shot, and my mom responded saying I'm not sure. He then said we'll make up your mind! My 78 year old mother in law with several disabilities had to be forcibly talked to like that! No bedside manner at all! Not happy, not happy at all!|Dr. Gonzalez is a most outstanding physician. His very busy practice is wonderfully run and very timely. Every member of his staff I have encountered from the women who staff the front desk to nurses, technicians, PAs and of course Dr. Gonzalez himself are excellent. I feel a staff this professional, caring and kind are a testament to the doctor who employs them. They've changed my quality of life giving me so much hope and ability to enjoy the remainder of my time on this planet. What better testament can one give?|I was referred to Dr Gonzalez, my experience was normal and effective. The team there are friendly. Dr Gonzalez did the treatment 2 appointment shots then the ablation treatment fast no pain just a ache. Thank you Dr Gonzalez and his team. I do recommend Dr Gonzalez|Dr. Gonzalez stood across the room, leaning against the wall, white coat, arms crossed. So arrogant.  Female assistant came in and talked to me while he watched. I could not have imagined a worst experience with a doctor.  He only wanted to do injections.  More money for him.  It was so upsetting that years later I haven't forgotten it.|I scheduled an appointment for my back and they had to reschedule after I had already taken off work then when I went in for my appointment I explained to them the pain I'm having and Dr. Gonzalez didn't even see me just his female assistant and right away she recommended an injection procedure. I asked if they can schedule an MRI first before  the injection procedure and his AST  said no. I have really good insurance and I want an MRI just incase I have a tumor on my spine or something is seriously wrong with my back but they won't schedule me for an MRI I don't mind getting the injection but they need to send me for an MRI so they know why my back is hurting so bad.|After a horrific auto accident in 2021, I was referred here by my primary care physician. I've had injections, ablations, ketamine IV's, and trials for spinal cord stimulators. Dr G and his staff have been sweethearts throughout all of these procedures. I was getting NO relief for my constant pain before coming here. These people have given me a reason to get out of bed every day.

But I did get a call from them to schedule me, and asked if they would even bother to get my pain under control so I can stabilize before a surgery and don't die while under. I was told this place does not prescribe controlled substances. This is getting insane. These crazy laws have got to change.

The receptionist said that they definitely got it but they sent the referral back to Modern Pain and Spine with the idiotic explanation that they would only except a referral from a primary doctor and that I didn't have current imaging of the area in question or the right documentation. So, I called over to Modern Pain and Spine and the very nice guy receptionist confirmed that UNM sent back the referral to them. I got the distinct impression even if I got a referral from an Optum primary doctor that wouldn't be good enough because it wasn't a UNM primary doctor. The receptionist said that several other patients of their's who they also referred to The UNM Pain Clinic had their referrals sent back to them as well with the same idiotic explanation. So I guess even a referral from a pain specialist that is fully qualified but is not affiliated with UNM is not good enough. Plus, I actually tried to get in to see one of their pain specialists around a year or more ago and at that time they would see me but they were scheduling 8 months out. I would never recommend anyone go to The UNM Pain Clinic ever.|So I am here at UNM today their check and process is a bunch of bullshit.

Government is the reason. Threats to providers cause them to react out of fear and not the patient's well being. People who drank the koolaid about the ""crisis"" and are  unaware that ILLEGAL STREET FENTANYL, not prescription medications, was responsible for the ""crisis"" need to get educated. When a patient on opiate pain meds prescribed to them for years is suddenly expected to just stop taking them or substitute suboxone (which is for addiction, not long term chronic pain) they can die. Many providers will not even offer a gradual taper or wean, even though they know it is the medically acceptable way. Forced weaning is only supposed to occur if misuse or addiction occurs, it is  risk vs benefit and shouldn't even happen in patients stable on the medications. It's unethical. Period. Until doctors understand that people are dying needlessly and that the ""harsh"" state laws (and federal interference btw) are actually causing massive pain and suffering which is unethical, as well as death, we are in trouble. Tell the CDC to stop trying to practice medicine and revoke the ridiculous and not medically sound ""guidelines"" they have forced on long term pain sufferers. It's barbaric not to treat pain. It causes people to die sooner. And the FACT is that patients who have successfully improved their health and quality of life over many years using opiates have very low rates of addiction, which is totally different from dependence. If you want to get more information just Google something like ""mistreatment of chronic pain patients"" or ""chronic pain advocacy groups"", and start facing the facts. Oh btw, these patients are NOT getting high. Those of you who leave reviews which insinuate that opioids are fraught with dangers are uneducated as to the facts. You may consider all the injections and ablations more ""reasonable"" but they do not work for everybody and they do have side effects as well. Stop judging. Insinuations that any pain patient is just looking for a high or is an addict is not helping matters. The govt is killing people.

My insurance co. refused to work with me so I could undergo the surgery, then shortly thereafter Dr. Dahlgren moved to NM. Although it was disappointing, he had explained to me what was happening at the Carson City clinic and it was time for him to go. In other words, the business was/ is shady. But Dr. Dahlgren is top notch. I recommend him to any and all people with severe chronic pain. Dahlgren is your man!|My wife Donna and I felt grateful to Dr dahlgren for taking us on as patients in Carson City. We were with him for several years,but suddenly he left without any notice,leaving us without a source for our meds.and thinking he was not the stand up man we thought he was. He's a very good doctor but not sure of him ethically.  I'd suggest making sure he will be there for people in N.Mexicobefore you get involved with him|Dr. Dahlgren's care is phenomenal. He is so patient and listens to what you say. It is remarkable to find a doctor that spent as much time and is trying to kill my pain. I'm so grateful!

The front counter staff will be nice to your face but then talk crap about you behind your back when your not there! The doctors they don't hear you at all and makes you feel stupid when there so called injections don't work! They have absolutely no sympathy for their patients! They whole staff should be replaced! Very unprofessional and surprisingly they haven't been charged with malpractice with how bad they are!|Horrible place to go to if you're looking to find a resolution to your pain they do nothing but suggest temporary relief for patients. The doctors are very unprofessional, they try to diagnose their patients on their opinions not how the patient feels. They also lost my MRI so I couldn't schedule my procedure, I highly recommend finding another pain center if you're looking for a problem solved.|The staff is nice. Today my elderly father had an appointment with the pain clinic. Ms L. Harris NP she cut his pain meds by 30 pills. She refused to listen that he can't survive without his full script. She said to him and the family that either go along with it or she drops him on the spot. The family Dr. Lino has the ability to get an DEA override. Ms. Harris answer she won't honor it. Dr. Lino said he can file for an injection with the court, of which she said she would not honor it.

If Ms Harris/ Lovelace decides not to fill the elderly father full prescription by Friday September 2, 2022. I will have no other choice but to start legal proceedings.|The worst. Brought my father in for a new patient appointment and we had to leave. The doctor was running late.... Yet we were never advised that until one of the receptionist heard my dad complain to me. She began getting loud and defensive right off the bat. I have worked with physicians/surgeons. I have done front desk and medical assisting .. I know how things work. There was no reason whatsoever for this receptionist to get defensive or loud. Everytime my dad wanted to say something she would speak over him. We ended up leaving and not rescheduling. You should always notify the patient when a physician is running behind/late. You're there to provide patient care. Not to argue or speak over them. Stay far a away from this place. Lovelace has really gone downhill.|Dr Gonzales is a horrible doctor. I was promised treatment done in a specific way for over a year, when it came time for the treatment I was already checked into my hospital room and given an IV when he briefly comes in and says see you in a few days... When I was supposed to go home the next day. I'd already tried the treatment his way a year prior and it didn't work. When I finally got home 2 days later my pain was still there, I had several huge bruises on my arms and my clothes were missing. While in the hospital I had to scramble to make care arrangements for my toddler for longer than planned and reschedule several other appointments before the drugs kicked in and I was incoherent. I just had my follow up appt at the office where I complained to Lauren the nurse practitioner, and I was basically kicked out of the pain clinic with a general paper referral- which no other pain clinic will accept, as it must be faxed from the doctors office. And was then told they wouldn't give me any meds for my pain to hold me over until I could get into another clinic. If I don't get into another clinic by the end of next week I will start to go through withdrawals. Dr Gonzales is so machismo and will tell you what you want to hear and then not follow through and will do things however he wants with no communication, no explanation, and no regard for what you need to line up in your personal life before undergoing treatment. STAY AWAY!|I have had nothing but good medical care from this facility since they revamped their clinic.  People on these reviews are complaining about being denied treatment and turned away from their appointment time.  You are told well in advance that you're to report 15 minutes early; if you're late, you're denied.  If you're there when they ask you to be there, you are taken in at your assigned appointment time or earlier.  I was there when a man (sounds like AJ Max) was denied his appointment because he was not 15 minutes early, but late for his original appointment time; he continued to make a spectacle of himself.  Sad!  So you do as you're asked, you'll be pleasantly surprised!  I appreciate my doctor being on time.  All too many times you go to an appointment and have to wait and wait.  Not here!|I'm glad Dr. Gonzalez moved to loveless pain, not downtown clinic anymore. I have no problem with him as my Dr. So far he has treated me well over the past two years. My issues is the receptionist and nurses at the downtown clinic. When they do answer the phones, there rude. There not empathetic or compassionate. The new location for Dr. Gonzalez, is friendly, helpful and compassionate.|The pain clinic is a joke. They told us over the phone they had moved and were at the women hospital. They aren't, they were across the loop in another building, the sign was cover by trees, so you couldn't read the name. My husband was referred there for pain medication, he had already undergone two botched attempts at injections which did damage that showed in imaging, and was given another injection by a doctor there that kept him in bed for 2 weeks. We explained all this to the nurse practitioner, Lauren Harris, her response was, ""Well that wasn't us"" , it was Dr Merhege, also with Lovelace pain management.

I was told to call my ins. co. they told me never heard of such ! I called Dr. Rices office the young  receptionist told me she did not tell me that. I could talk to the young lady who I saw first that would cost me another $50.00 well I still have not seen dr. Rice. I do not understand.

Doctor wouldn't even look at my injection site which was swollen and already painful. So now I sit in the ER a month later when the doctor at the PAIN center, which I'm assuming is supposed to specialize in relieving PAIN, refused to help me and could have saved me a lot of pain had she just listened.

""You scheduled it, you tell me. We had our followup already.""  ""Doc"" stared at me like a cow looking at an oncoming train. Deer in the headlights.""Doc"" tried to make an excuse to save face, but I just left.
They scheduled me, wasted my time, caused me great pain and then ignored me. I called the call center to find out what happened. Apparently there was SUPPOSED to be a 2nd followup, but the fact that the ""Doctor"" had absolutely no idea that that was supposed to be happening tells me she had no care or followup or any thought to check a patients file. So here I now sit, in the ER, as I type this, hoping that eventually Ill be seen to fix a problem that should and could have been prevented or treated ahead of time before it reached this point. I will no longer be attending this clinic.

This is pure negligence on their part and they refuse to recognize it.

DO NOT USE THIS CLINIC OR ""DR"" Ravenshroud, you will regret it.|The staff was extremely rude. I was referred there to get a plasma injection. When I inquired if they performed this procedure there I was told that only the doctor could answer that question and that I must give a urine sample before I could talk to the doctor. Once I was finally shown into a room an assistant came in. I attempted to make conversation and the attendant seemed very agitated. I have Interstitial Cystitis so I asked if she knew what that was. She then stormed out of the room. Sometime later man identifying himself as the manager came in. He stated they did not do the plasma procedure there and the they would not treat me in their group because I had insulted whoever the lady was. In a form letter sent to me later they said they would not treat me because I failed to follow their policy of listing my medical history on their specific form rather than them accepting a typed 3-page history. Had the front desk person, or any of the other people I questioned regarding them performing the plasma procedure, all this would  ot have happened. To this day I have no idea who the people I spoke with are. No had a name tag and no one introduced themselves.|a year ago I was referred to New Mexico Pain Center in Alamogordo NM.  MY APPOINTMENT WAS FOR 9 am.  i arrived and there were over 30 people standing inline or just checked in for the 9 am appointment.  There were not even enough chairs for help of the on crutches, walkers etc.  fast forward to now.  My doctor referred me to New Mexico pain center in las cruces for Dr Vasquez.  I made an appointment.  Gave them some info went online to fill out patient forms.  Two weeks later I get a call telling me to pick up 17 pages of patient forms.  I told them it was a 90 miles drive.  She said ok.  No they can't mail or email them and they are not online.
We drove down early to fill out forms.  I was made to sit  and wait to get new patient forms.  Finally she came out asked me a lot of questions stared at the screw for over ten minutes and finally gathered forms and gave them to me.  I went somewhere else to fill them out returned in time for the appointment.  She finally called me up stared at the screen again for ten minutes and finally said do you have an appointment here.  Why didn't she ask me that an hour ago when she stared at the screen.  Then she says your appointment is in Alamogordo.  Not at anytime did these people say my appointment was Alamogordo to see some female doctor where I could again be treated like cows lined up for slaughter.  I got my forms back snd told her to remove ne from everything in that company.  Not even a modicum of respect care or concern.  I will drive back to Tulsa where I can get PRP injections in my knees and be treated like a person.|I am so impressed with NM Pain Center.

Founded by board-certified physicians dedicated to non-surgical pain management solutions, the institute specializes in Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy, stem cell treatments, and other innovative regenerative techniques that harness the body's natural healing abilities. Their state-of-the-art facility on Montgomery Boulevard provides a comfortable environment where patients receive personalized care plans designed to address the root causes of pain rather than merely masking symptoms.</p></p>

<p></p>
<p><p>The medical team at PRP Regenerative Pain Institute offers treatments for a wide range of conditions, including joint pain, sports injuries, arthritis, back pain, and degenerative disc disease. Their signature PRP therapy involves drawing a small amount of the patient's blood, processing it to concentrate healing platelets, and then precisely injecting this growth factor-rich solution into damaged tissues to stimulate repair and regeneration. This minimally invasive approach helps patients avoid surgery while experiencing significant pain reduction and improved function.</p></p>

<p><h3>Patient-Centered Approach</h3></p>
<p><p>What distinguishes PRP Regenerative Pain Institute is their commitment to individualized care. Each patient undergoes a thorough evaluation to determine the most appropriate regenerative treatment protocol for their specific condition. The physicians take time to educate patients about their options, expected outcomes, and recovery processes. This collaborative approach ensures patients are active participants in their healing journey, leading to higher satisfaction rates and better long-term results.</p></p>

As with any medical provider, we have not always seen eye-to-eye; however, he has remained open to hearing our concerns and addressing my wife's pain as he can. We tried a different pain clinic in Abq. and are returning to Dr. Isaac's office for care.
His front desk staff have always been professional and courteous. His office manager, Anthony, is one of the kindest and most genuine people that we have met.|Was sent here for back pain a while back. Finally getting around to leaving a review for this awful medical experience and the horrible medical advice given to me by doctor Isaacs.

I was told basically to avoid bending, twisting or lifting anything and to get as many injections needed until I was pain free. Two huge needles in my spine later (he was arguing with his tech about which gauge needle to use while I was face down on the table) my pain was more or less unaffected. Dr. Isaacs also told me the shots do not impacts surgens ability to operate. A surgeon later told me that is not true at all and they require delayment of surgery because of these injections which cause scar tissue.

I was lied to in order to milk my insurance and went through a harmful and unnecessary procedure that caused me more distress and frustration. I should have known when I saw all the wierd botox promotions in the lobby...

For those with pain from bulged or herniated discs. Give physical therapy another shot. It will give you the tools to heal yourself. Health doesnt come from a needle but dr. Isaacs vacation house would probably disagree with me.|I'm not sure what these low reviews come from..but from my experience I have been utilizing Dr. Isaac's knowledge and experience since 2016. If you are honestly looking to get off of the pharmakeia and get real, God given  self healing, from proven modalities. Then this is the place for you.|I have seen Dr. ISSACS for several years. The staff are friendly and delightful. Scheduling
is easy and convenient. Dr Issacs is very focused and professional . He does have a dry sense of humor but he is devoted to giving excellent care and making sure I'm getting the best treatment possible. I'm very happy with my progress there and won't hesitate to make referrals.|I have been seeing Dr Issacs next week for several years.  He has helped me with back pain, shoulder pain, and leg pain.  The staff are always professional, empathetic, and understanding.  When ever I call, I am able to get in within a few days.  I've referred my husband and two of my sisters - all have seen results from treatments and are very happy with Dr. Issacs.|Excellent service and very friendly staff. I came to Dr. Issacs about 4 years ago for my left knee and the treatment helped tremendously. Just recently I came in for my right knee and knew I would get the help I needed. Money well spent. Dr. Issacs is knowledgeable and cares for your well being. Now I can get back to being pain free.|After working as a writer and in the media, extensively using a keyboard for almost 40 years, I began to have pain in my left thumb two years ago that affected, among other things, my favorite amusement: playing guitar. Pain would shoot into the middle two joints of my left thumb, such that I could barely play. The diagnosis? de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Several weeks ago, my right thumb also became so stricken that I couldn't open a bottle or pick up a jar. Most likely, osteoarthritis, de Quervain's, or both. Of all things, I saw a promo on Instagram for Softwave Technology: high power ultrasound waves used to break up adhesions and scar tissue and particularly effective for treating arthritis and planter fasciatis. Most importantly, available right here in Albuquerque at Dr Isaac's pain management clinic. I wasted little time and have since had 6 treatments on my left hand and 4 on my right. The change is remarkable. After each treatment the pain disappeared before slowly returning but less painful than before. The pain is still present 2 months later, but is greatly reduced. I can again use my hands to open bottles, pick up jars, and, thankfully, play guitar. It hasn't completely remedied the pain, but the change has been invaluable for me. I will return for more treatments once I establish a new baseline. So far, so good. I am so grateful for Dr Isaac and his wonderful staff. They are great to work with, help to get me in for appointments, and I have a new lease on using the most valuable thing I have, my hands. Thank you, Dr Isaac and company.|Unprofessional customer service. I had an appointment scheduled, but was bedridden with a migraine so I didn't show up to my appointment and was unable to call and cancel. I called a few weeks later to try to get on the schedule but no one answered so I left a (detailed) message requesting a call back to get scheduled. Today- I finally get a hold of someone- and get told that no call-no shows on the first appointment will not be seen as a patient at this establishment. They never thought to give a courtesy call to let me know since I had been waiting weeks to be called, as I have been in excruciating pain for 3 months.

In 9/2024, I saw a nurse practitioner named Mirna Chavez (she apparently is no longer there). Her manner was cold and detached. She gave me a cursory exam. My lower back pain comes and goes. At that very moment it was gone. She sent me for x-rays. Radiologist William Long read them and said everything was normal. (Side note: They didn't x-ray my SI joints, even though previous x-rays from 2021 showed mild arthritis and it feels to me - and seems to physical therapists - to be a source of pain).

I guess they only allotted me 15 minutes of face time with the doctor and my visit should last no more than 15 minutes. What a farce they are!

They don't truly care about the patients. All they care about is money.

He Really can not be moved to take him to a doctor when he is sick. When he was coughing with phlegm buildup, LEAA was really my last hope to get him checked out. They came next day, took Xrays and blood tests, then gave him the antibiotics he needed along with his flu shot and iron infusion he also needed. LEAA is an extremely valuable resource for people in similar situations. I hope they can work with Medicare in the near future because it is not inexpensive (what is these days.) But  I highly recommend their professionalism and services. It's comforting to know I can get a good doctor to see my dad at a moment's notice. Thank you so much Sharon and the LEAA team!|I was extremely impressed with the service. They arrived almost immediately, which was a huge relief as the visit was for my elderly mother, who has difficulty getting in and out of the house. The Physician Assistant was very knowledgeable, professional, and compassionate, making the whole process much easier for us. I couldn't be happier with the experience and would highly recommend this service to anyone in need of prompt, quality care at home.|I've used LEAA Health two times for  my elderly mother. Both customer service and medical care have been excellent. I highly recommend LEAA if you want to avoid the hassle factor of urgent care or your regular doctor...or have mobility issues (like my mother). LEAA is a bit costly, but worth it! I only wish they offered service in Atlanta.|This service is a joke! My elderly mom is bedridden due to a broken tibia and she is in a brace. She needs the Covid and flu vaccines according to her doctors and the number of respiratory infections. I called the service and they do not accept ANY insurance and view themselves as a concierge service! I am not asking for spa services in the home, but medical ones! LEAA asked for $250 for the visit and $200 for each vaccine or a total of $650 for shots that are free in any pharmacy.  Most of their patients are elderly, yet they do not accept Medicare, any supplemental insurance or Medicaid. I guess if you're not rich, you can go to hell!|I had the best experience yesterday (Thanksgiving day) with the Leaa team. My mother  (85) was not feeling well and had a a high fever. I was frantic trying to find a doctor to see her. I found Leaa and took a chance. I can't thank them enough for caring for my mother so quickly. Within an hour of my call there was a doctor at our door. He was kind, gentle and thorough. He performed blood work and set up and IV. The Xray tech was close behind to take chest X-rays. Overall it was such a wonderful experience given the circumstances. I highly recommend this service and will call them again for future emergency situations. Thank you, Adam and Dr. Azor for taking my call on a Holiday, providing such great care and working with me on pricing. I truly appreciate it.|After having a nightmare of an experience with Essenmed I was absolutely THRILLED with LEAA. My mom's aid tested her for a UTI on a Thursday night and it was a positive result. I messaged them on the website and they called me at 11am on Friday and by 1:30 they had an md at my mom's house. It's been impossible to get her to come out of the house bc she has dementia.  He sent a prescription for an antibiotic as well as her maintenance meds. I will definitely be using them on a regular basis. It's so difficult finding medical professionals for dementia or homebound patients. SO happy I found LEAA.|Dr. Emanuel and the team are excellent.  My mom is basically bedridden and became quite ill. I called Dr. Emanuel in the evening and he arrived early morning the next day. He was able to test mom and based on the medical results, Dr. Emanuel was able to appropriately & immediately treat her with IV antibiotics for the next 7 days. Although this is an expensive service, it is worth it when it comes to our loved ones. Thank you LEAA!|This service is a life saver! I highly recommend this- they were pros!

Try him first- you'll get to the core of the issue quickly.|I can't recommend Dr. Miro highly enough for anyone dealing with plantar fasciitis. He's truly a one-stop-shop who offered shockwave therapy, laser treatment, and a host of others. He has a very holistic and science based approach that helped me not only understand the condition better, but also significantly reduced my pain and improved my mobility.

If you're struggling with plantar fasciitis or any similar issues, Dr. Miro is definitely the specialist to see!|Before seeing Dr. Nemirovsky, I visited another physical therapist to treat my lower back pain caused by long hours working behind a computer, from which I experienced only marginal improvement.
Dr. Nemirovsky accurately diagnosed the cause of the pain and recommended a treatment and gradual exercise regimen that took into consideration my schedule and lifestyle.

His treatment not only gave me immediate pain relief, but, also helped build enduring muscular strength and restore flexibility within the areas that were causing the pain after only a few visits.

In addition to his expertise, the beautiful office and friendly staff make this one of my best medical experiences in the city.|I have been seeing Dr. Nemirovsky for 3+ years and 6 marathons and would recommend him to any runner or athlete! He has helped me through several Achilles challenges, including during race week. He is thorough and makes sure to explain what I should do to improve muscle strength and stability to avoid future injuries. Excellent bedside manner. He provides useful training and overall health guidance as well. I think of him as an extension of my marathon training program. Highly recommend!|The entire staff is very helpful, kind, and extremely efficient. If it wasn't for Dr. Rolland Nemirovsky I strongly feel the bursitis in my shoulder would still be in major pain. If you have shoulder pain, rotator cuff issues, or bursitis don't hesitate, RUN to see this man! I came to Manhattan Sports Therapy skeptical because I had already visited two other physical therapist who were not getting me better. I had pain for 9 months until visiting MST.  Nemirovsky was patient with my healing process and was always transparent when telling me what stages I was in my recovery. Now I am fully recovered back to pumping iron and putting on a backpack without pain. Thank you to everyone in that office for making my experience great from start to finish.|Dr. Nemirovsky is extremely professional and without a doubt the best at what he does. I have been seeing him for over four years now for lower back pain and tightness . I am feeling like a new woman. The results for me on a personal level have been incredible. My flexibility , balance and posture have dramatically changed. His staff is extremely friendly and professional. Grateful to have found him !!!!!|Dr. Rolland Nemirovsky, the chiropractor, is a really nice and friendly individual; however, he is not a good chiropractor or therapist. He's a lot of talk and not a lot of results.
I had a lot of pain in my left leg. It was a simple athlete injury from over-exercising or overworking the muscles. I was going to Dr. Nemirovsky to help it, but it simply was not improving at all. I went three times and I was still limping. My doctoral friends suggested I go see another chiropractor that they suggested. This other chiropractor was baffled that I had been adjusted two days prior because my hips and shoulders were so unaligned it was practically impossible for a competent chiropractor to have adjusted me correctly two days prior. I went one time to this other chiropractor and my injury significantly improved.
Listen, Manhattan sports has a lot of fancy equipment and Dr. Nemirovsky is a lot of talk (like he says so much to try and make it seem like he knows what he is talking about to the point I was already skeptical  after the first session), chiropractic is one of the OLDEST alternative forms of medicine in time. It does not require fancy equipment at all, it simply requires a competent doctor that knows how to readjust your spine.
Dr. Nemirovsky thought it was a long-term process (and I may not know if that is true) but he requires co-payments no matter what insurance you have, so he is just reeling money out of you for as long as possible when you could go to another chiropractor and have the problem solved after 2-3 sessions instead of 4 weeks worth.
Your spine is your core, it's what holds you together. I am a firm believer in chiropractic, but you need to have someone who knows what they're doing.|I've never written a review before but after being treated at Manhattan Sports Therapy, for the last couple of months, particularly by Dr. Nemirovsky, I felt compelled to do so.  Being an avid fitness buff, I found myself with chronic shoulder pain in addition to lower back pain.  Dr. Nemirovsky treated me with his skillful chiropractic modalities as well as instructing me on proper biomechanics.  He also assigned specific exercises and stretches that expedited my healing.  I am incredibly grateful for his work.  I highly recommend his services to anyone who has chronic or acute pain and wants to maintain a high level of fitness.",2025-02-20|2024-09-16|2022-01-15|2019-05-01|2019-11-11|2016-07-21|2018-12-08|2016-07-21,5|5|5|5|5|5|1|5,,,,,"Onsite services, Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended","What insurance do you take?","United Healthcare, Aetna, BCBS, Cigna, UMR",emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|multiple_locations|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJvUNoAvBYwokRgEE8DruXvTc,36

My previous doctor retired and I was in desparate need of care and relief!

I was welcomed by a friendly, patient-forward staff who truly takes the time to understand my physical needs. They worked with me to create a personalized treatment plan, and I've received top-notch care with noticeable improvements. Following the doctor's instructions at home has been key, and as long as you do so, you're sure to have a speedy recovery.

I highly recommend Dr. Schecter and his team to anyone looking for exceptional pain management--Oh-- and yes, STAY for the delicious snacks right after your procedure! I was here for a good time, not a long time, y'all!|I went for pain using my medicare and they talked me into spending thousands of dollars to ease pain and reduce my bloat.
I really needed an MRI and  I was told I needed 6 sessions.  After 3 there was no difference and I was then told it should have worked at least a little.  GARBAGE WASTE OF MONEY and they never even called me back to see how I was doing.  Charlatans NOT doctors

AND THEY DENIED I WAS A PATIENT...STAY AWAY!!!!!!!|Excellent experience. Dr. Schechter is kind thorough and quick. Answered questions and straightforward and clear.

Front desk were pleasant, quick and direct from my initial call to my visit end.

Entire first patient appt was 40 min. 10/10 would recommend. I work in healthcare and to visit a place like this is exactly how a medical office should be run.|I don't even know where to start, as I have NEVER in my entire life been treated this way by a healthcare professional. My experience at this facility was gut wrenching to say the least. It literally had me in tears by the time I gotten to my car. I'm writing this review with the hopes It can be a step toward making sure others don't experience the same treatment, and even prompt this facility to reassess their practices.

I arrived on 10/28 at 2:42 PM for my 2:45 PM appointment to see Dr. Mann for the progressively worsening pain in my neck/ back / shoulder/ elbow & both hands . I  promptly filling out the required paperwork and returning it to the receptionist, I was asked to wait. After waiting for approximately 15 minutes, I approached the receptionist to ask if Dr. Mann was running on time. I was assured that he was and was told to continue waiting. Ten minutes later, I inquired again and received the same response. At 3:17 PM, I was finally brought to an exam room, where an assistant took my blood pressure, which was noticeably high. I asked how high, she said 167 over (and I didn't hear the rest) I waited an additional 10 min. in the exam room before I returned to the receptionist area to inquire about the delay. One receptionist was  kind enough to check on the doctor and informed me that he was on his way. I was taken to a different exam Room by the lovely male assistant.  I'm guessing Dr. Mann finally received my paperwork as he had questions which he asked the male assistant to ask me. The assistant walked back and forth 2 times to deliver my responses to him. I had to ask, why did he not just come into the room and ask me these questions in person. When Dr. Mann did enter the room, there was NO apology or acknowledgment of the long wait. Instead, his demeanor was brusque and unwelcoming, which made me feel as if my time and health concerns were inconsequential. Rather than addressing my questions directly, he seemed annoyed, and when I mentioned the delay, he dismissed my concern by saying, ""No one  goes to a doctor and be  seen at the exact appointment time."" He further went on to insisted he was not late as I was taken into the exam room and seen By who! the assistant who ONYL took my blood pressure while texting on her phone. Additionally, despite my elevated blood pressure, he neither acknowledged it nor offered further guidance, which left me feeling as though my health was not being taken seriously. How could you allow a patient to leave with elevated blood pressure levels as high a mine.  He then said there are other patients he was seeing. Fine, not an issue. I was just asking to be communicated with. I told him he had poor bedside manners and it went even more left. He even told me I'm not making the situation any better. I asked how long will this visit take as he was 45 min late. He then insisted again he was NOT late and with an attitude stated ""as long as I wanted it to"" Pardon, how do you tell a patient that. This interaction ended after two minutes. He stormed out the exam room left me behind & headed directly to the front desk and stated abruptly ""she can leave"". As a health care professional we take an oath to do no harm. Waiting for so long without updates, feeling dismissed, and dealing with a lack of empathy can make a difficult situation so much harder. Healthcare providers should show compassion, professionalism, and respect -- and no one should have to leave an appointment feeling worse than when they arrived. The lack of communication and empathy from that initial receptionist and doctor.  I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect both timely care and basic courtesy, and neither of these should be compromised, especially in a healthcare setting. I think we all deserve a healthcare provider who prioritizes not only our physical health but also treats you with the respect and compassion every patient deserves. I am very concerned that this experience reflects a lack of regard for patients' time and well-being. I came in with my pain at a 7 and left there with it on 10....

I suffered with foot pain for a year ..went to two podiatrists that underestimated my complaint to over pronation and flat feet. One Yr later my coworker recommended Dr Jaramillo who thoroughly investigated my foot complaint to proper diagnose my foot pain was due to a runners injury that led to the right treatment and now my foot feels brand new . Pain is at a minimum. In addition, the front desk staff was friendly,  supportive and helpful. First class service from start to finish .

Was easy to call the office and speak to someone, which sadly can't be said about the larger hospitals where you need to jump through hoops and input your personal info 5 times before being able to speak to anyone. Dr. Melepura was the 3rd dr I saw about my neck. He was easy to talk to, attentive, and was patient in addressing many questions I had. I appreciated that he gave recommendations based on my personal needs rather than a boilerplate response. Will go back for follow up in a few weeks.|Dr Febin is fantastic! Highly recommend him and his practice the Spin clinic. The doctor is a good listener, kind, attentive and gave me great advice. I was nervous for the procedure but he made me feel very comfortable and it went smoothly. Dia and Jazmin at the front desk are super easy to work with. They are awesome people who truly care. I really appreciate the follow up texts and quick responses to all my questions! I'm starting PT with Derrick soon, will update this review after. The office is really well designed, super comfortable chairs and great decor/vibe. Very chic. Added bonus for sure. Don't think twice, book an appointment!|When I suddenly experienced knee pain I dreaded going to the large orthopedic practice near me, which I knew would mean multiple visits to the crowded waiting room, and a feeling of being herded through the system.  Dr. Melepura offered a very different experience.   His office is modern and calm, and his staff are great. Dr. Melepura listened to me and took time to explain his recommended course of treatment. His thoughtful and unhurried approach reminded me of how health care should be, using all the technology and tools available today without sacrificing the all-important personal doctor/patient dynamic.   I highly recommend SPIN.|Great experience. You will NOT be disappointed. Welcoming from the front desk, doctor to the Physical Therapist. Listened to understand and explained everything. I will be back. Very professional and clean office.|I had an overall positive experience at the clinic. The wait time was appropriate, and the staff and doctor were very personable, making me feel truly cared for. The doctor recommended physical therapy, an MRI, and injections, which helped alleviate my pain within 48 hours. I'm grateful for the care I received, especially since I had been in a lot of pain and unable to work. Thank you for making a difference in my recovery!|Start to finish, I had an amazing experience here! I was able to book a same day appointment for some back pain I was experiencing. The receptionist was lovely, the office was clean and modern, and Dr Melepura totally impressed me with his kind and opening approach. He listened carefully to what I was experiencing, and set me up with a clear plan to help. 10/10 would recommend!!|Dr. Melepura is one of the best doctors I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. He was able to take me as a new patient, same-day when I woke up with immense neck pain, unable to move my head. He's extremely attentive and truly listens and empathizes with whatever pain you're experiencing. We were able to set up a treatment plan and some procedures the very same day. I'm also doing my physical therapy appointments at his office as well, and their PT Derek is superb--extremely patient and encouraging! The entire staff is super lovely, and the office itself is welcoming, bright, and fresh. I cannot say enough good things about this practice! I highly recommend Dr. Melepura to anyone seeking high-quality care.|Every time I come to here, I leave thinking ""this is what care is meant to be like; this is what everyone meant when they said 'patient-centered care.'""Dr. Melepura's entire staff - from the incredible ladies at the front desk to his PT Derrek to Dr. Melepura himself - is fantastic.

When you walk in, you are greeted with warmth and offered a water. Dr. Melepura sees you on time for you appointment, is attentive and caring, and takes the time to deeply understand your pain. He also refuses to let you settle for ""okay"" and insists on making sure you get all the way better. In my last check up, when I reported that I'm not having much pain anymore, his response was ""but how much do you think about your back?"" When I admitted it's every day, he said ""then, that's not good enough - our goal is your pain is such that you don't think about it, that you don't make adjustments in your day-to-day.""

Meanwhile, the PT on staff (Derrek) is the best I have seen. I had knee surgery 6 months ago and plateau'ed in my recovery after 8 weeks. 4 months post-op, I still couldn't straighten my leg fully or go up and down stairs, and was having significant pain when walking. The prior physical therapists I was seeing kept telling me to ""just keep going"" on the same set of exercises that weren't helping. I started seeing Derrek in mid-December, and a month later I was walking again normally without pain. Now, another two weeks later, I'm back doing stairs, lunges, squats and even burpees. Derrek is highly attentive, makes physical therapy sessions fun, and, like Dr. Melepura, provides a level of care that is hard to find, and truly makes a difference. He is giving me my normal life back.

Rarely do I rave so much about a business or doctor's office, but this team is making a true difference and getting me back to full functionality and full strength again after a year of wondering if I might not return to my pre-injury state. I cannot recommend Derrek and Dr. Melepura highly enough.",2025-01-16|2025-02-04|2025-02-13|2025-02-28|2024-11-14|2024-09-30|2024-09-20|2025-02-14,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|comfortable_waiting_area|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJa51_4KZZwokRsBJ5WKG6HyY,539

She was very supportive and empathic. She asked all the necessary questions and talked to the provider, explaining our situation shortly after establishing an appointment.

Dr Tamer as well very professional. Sylvia Nunez the secretary will make sure that you get everything you need. Nifher is phenomenal I really don't like needles but she almost make me love them. As for D,  great customer service.
You won't be deceived if you choose Pain physicians NY.|Dr. Kim is very compassionate and a good listener.  He understood my situation and prescribed exactly what i needed.  i have great confidence in his knowledge and judgment and am looking forward to working with him in the future.
this past week i met with Dr. Elbaz who is the same.  Kind, compassionate and provides immediate care.  I highly recommend this practice!|I have no problem with doctors here, they are very helpful and considering. It's always the receptionist that are problem. I wanted to change the physical therapy place so I got new doctors note and got all the form ready, but the office have to send authorization code to PT place so the I would be able to get the treatment. But the lady who handles with this is not helpful and not sending out the right codes that PT place is requested. I've been contacting the office since 2 months ago and still coyld not change Physical Therapy place because they haven't solved this problem yet.
I've been trying to send out email, call the office but it's impossible to reach out to the lady who handles this|The staff here is very professional and nice. Did not have a long wait time so that's a plus. Overall great experience!

Update from 2020- 2021: I changed to a different physical therapist because I felt that I was getting worse (due to their injections. It did absolutely nothing for me and only kept the pain away for a few days) and expressing concern that I felt surgery was needed and I wasn't taken seriously. Went to St Barnabas instead, was scheduled for surgery about 2 months later and I can move without pain again.|Wonderful place to get pain treatment. Dr Elbaz and Dr. Kim and Dr ko are all so pleasant, they make me feel comfortable and laid back when I'm there. The Staff is very friendly and welcoming. They communicate well and do what they can to make sure I'm getting the treatment I need.  They do their part in contacting the insurance company and so forth which can be very troublesome in getting approvals. Again, wonderful place and amazing doctors and staff.|The doctors at Pain Physicians are absolutely amazing.  You are treated with compassion, extreme competence and care. They differ from other pain management doctors that I have been to in that they study carefully and treat your symptoms immediately. They do not make you wait for your treatment plan and treat your pain expeditiously.|I've been seeing Dr Elbaz for 11 years now. He is the best!! I don't know what I would've done without his services. His concerns for your well been & making sure your pain is at minimum level is top priority!! Thank you for being the GREAT PHYSICIAN THAT YOU ARE!!  Justin also brings a GREAT decorum & professionalism to the office. Last and not least, the ladies at the front desk are professional and dedicated, as well as the medical assistant staff who are always caring & supportive.|The doctors here are gifted, kind and talented. I work exclusively with Dr ElBaz, who is nothing short of a miracle worker.  He has really helped me survive debilitating, chronic pain and I cannot thank him enough.

But there are serious staff and office issues that caused me to remove one star.  They have retrained the one receptionist used to be very rude- and I noticed and really appreciate it. Most staff are lovely.

But the office definitely needs to be better organized!  I don't think I've ever waited for less than an hour to be seen. Often longer. That's really something that needs to be fixed!

But it's - for me - it's worth  the wait. They're that good.

Their office is extremely disorganized, and I had to call them multiple times a day just to get any kind of information about whether my injections would be covered by insurance. More often than not, I was given wrong information, only to be hit with thousands of dollars in unexpected charges when they told me insurance would cover it.

The worst part was when I was literally on the operating table, about to receive an injection, and found out that insurance wasn't going to cover it after all. I ended up spending thousands over the course of 4 injections, all because of their inability to properly communicate or manage billing.

When I tried to speak directly with the doctor, I was told an assistant would talk to me instead. This assistant had no knowledge of my case, had no idea what ingredients were in my injection, and couldn't provide me with any helpful information. It wasn't until weeks later that I finally got a call from the doctor, who phoned me on speakerphone while driving, with an extremely annoyed tone, as if it was a huge inconvenience to have to speak with me.

This place is a disaster from top to bottom. The staff was unhelpful and rude, and the physicians were even worse. There are plenty of other clinics to choose from that will actually value your time and money. Stay away from this one.|Ainsworth Institute is one of the most professional, efficient, and reliable clinical practice. Dr. Hunter is at the leading edge of the field of pain management. He provides understandable explanation of procedure, along with risks and benefits.  My patient experience was comfortable and calm before and after. The practice ensures follows up so the clinicians can measures the recovery and response.|Dr. Hunter had destroyed my life. Dr. Hunter suggested and then performed a permanent/ irreversible procedure, Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block using alcohol, to eliminate my pain in my rectum region. Dr. Hunter only mentioned one side effect/complication (semen in the urine) from this procedure to me (recorded on video confirming this), so I agreed to get this procedure done by him because I didn't have this side effect. After I got this procedure, I lost all my feeling in rectum and I was unable to have bowel movements on my own anymore (basically paralyzed in my rectum area)(never mentioned as a risk/side effect from Dr. Hunter). Dr. Hunter said not having bowel movements ""doesn't constitute an emergency"" to him, although this can create serious health complications or death. Dr. Hunter never told me about this complication or risk (not being able to ever have a bowel movement on my own), because if he did, I would had never ever in my life done this procedure at only 28 years old. I went to numerous other professionals who said this procedure should had never been performed on me for this very reason. Dr. Hunter was upset with me and yelled at me when I called him upset about my permanent complications I had. Dr. Hunter had the audacity to bill me for that phone call I had with him discussing about the complications I had. Dr. Hunter charged my insurance company 10s of thousands of dollars and he had me also pay thousands of dollar to him even though he destroyed my life. I had to take time off work and be put on anti-depressants. I plan on getting a lawyer to get justice for the permanent damage (both mentally and physically) Dr. Hunter had caused me. Afterwards, I will reach out to the New York medical board.|The staff are all awesome people. Professional and down to earth. Courteous, polite, the list is endless.

Additionally, he was able to quickly diagnose an underlying condition within moments of me describing my symptoms and offered me additional nuance into the condition that no physician has previously been able to provide. In a word - my husband and I were impressed. Very grateful for the relief Dr. Siefferman provided. His office staff is friendly and the brief glance I had of the waiting room before I was whisked into an exam room was modern and sophisticated.|The team at Manhattan Pain Medicine have been amazing! From the friendly operations and medical bill staff to the nurses and doctors. In the past, I have had horrible experiences with Rheumatology and pain management BUT my quality of life  has really transformed under the care of Dr. Nino, Dr. Seifferman, Adam and Dr. Mika. Having the wrap around services of rheum, pain management, and nutrition in one practice as a person with autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, EDS, and complex endometriosis,  it is life changing. The staff truly works as a team and the nursing staff are amazing, caring and competent. I've never been rushed and have had grace with navigating costs. I highly recommend and have referred friends and family. Lastly, they have a great network of physical and pelvic therapist to refer folks to who share the same work ethic.|Have been working with MPM for the last 2 years. Dr. SIefferman figured out a chronic issue that no other doctor had determined in the 5 years prior. They are very thorough and thoughtful in figuring out the best way to treat my chronic issue.|Dr. Siefferman, Dr. Nino, Adam, Dr. Mika, and team go above and beyond. I have been a patient of Dr. Siefferman's for over 5 years. They understand my multiple chronic pain and autoimmune conditions, and will keep searching for the root cause. I am provided with multiple treatment options to personalize my plan. They are an A+ team and keep working to improve my quality of life.|I began seeing Dr Siefferman six months ago after visiting numerous other physicians who performed procedures on me for severe pelvic pain. The procedures did not work and my condition worstened with each surgery. Dr Siefferman gave me more explanations and education about my condition during my first visit than any of the other doctors did during my previous visits. He also stressed the importance of imaging for my condition and was surprised that none had been done by any of my past physicians.
I have found Dr Siefferman extraordinary in every regard.He is warm, kind, patient and very reassuring. He has given me hope about my condition and my future. He is easy to talk to and as a female with such a personal issue, I find I can talk to him about everything related to my physical condition. The rest of the staff is wonderful; Stephanie and Ginelle are front desk dreams and Omer will help you with everything- with grace. Louisa is a darling who cares for you like you are family during procedures. This is a special team and I recommend them very highly!|I went there yesterday to find a new pain management doctor. Being so young and living with pain is very hard. Adam and Dr. Siefferman were so knowledgeable and patient. They don't rush you and really make sure all your questions are answered. Coming from NJ it was a little bit of a hike but well worth it. Dr. Siefferman diagnosed me with more things that other doctors didn't catch. I also love that Dr. Nino their Rheumatologist works hand in hand with Dr. Siefferman.  They came up with a wonderful treatment plan for me while working together to figure out what's best. I did get a procedure done in the office which the dr learned more about my case. The office is clean and the front staff and medical assistants are so sweet as well! They worked with our scheudle so that I don't have to drive in multiple times but once for 2 appointments. I highly recommend them! And am very happy that I found a new Rheumatologist and pain management doctor! Thank you Adam, Dr. Siefferman, and Dr. Nino for all your help.

Update: Dr. Siefferman, Dr. Nino, Dr. Barbiere and Adam have changed my life completely. They are helping me manage multiple chronic conditions. They are easily accessible through email and they still every time take the time out to make sure I get what I need in the office. I usually spend up to 1hr-2. I can't recommend this office enough. It's wonderful to have a team who really listens to you and understand you and not just gaslight you. Everyone's bedside manner is amazing. I love coming here not just because I'll be out of pain but also because the staff are so patient, caring, and fun to be around.|I was amazed that finally I found an office that actually cares about my health issues. Dr. Nino is awesome!  The staff will go the extra mile to make feel you feel comfortable and that you matter.|I have been a patient of this office for a few months now. I was dealing with knee problems for the longest time and was then referred to Dr. Siefferman and his practice. Off the bat, Dr Siefferman was able to identify the problem with my knees and provided me with a plan to relieve the pain in them. After a few months, I am experiencing little to no pain under Dr. Siefferman's Care. The office staff is very friendly and Dr Siefferman is a fantastic doctor.

Dr Patel listens carefully to your explanation of pain, proceeds quickly with appropriate treatment and is concerned to carefully follow up to insure results are lasting. Her personality immediately puts you at ease and she explains every step of treatment as she goes.|I have been going to the Pain Treatment specialist for the past few weeks.
I have had the most amazing experience. The staff is amazing very friendly and attentive.
Dr Patel is very Professional. She is warm and make you feel so comfortable. She tells you step by step what she is doing and answers all my concerns. She calls to make sure you are doing well after the procedure and I have nothing but praise for Dr Patel and her staff. I highly recommend her at the clinic.|Doctor Patel is the best pain doctor I've ever been to. She made me feel extremely comfortable during my visit. She talked me through each step of the trigger point injection process. Kept checking up on me to see how I was feeling during the visit and AFTER. She's really patient and truly cares about her patients well being. 10/10 experience! Works can't describe how thankful I am.|I love Dr. Patel! I could barely walk, my knee hurt so bad, and after I had an x-ray, Dr. Patel fixed it! I call it magic! No after-effects, no soreness, just total pain relief! So much so that my husband wants to see her too!! I highly recommend her, and she has a very charming manner as well! PS I'm adding to this review that my knee is still perfect and she has solved my back issues too, my husband has had fantastic results with his shoulders and back!! If you are in pain, run to see Dr. Patel!!!|I began to see Dr. Hanna on the recommendation of a friend who had gotten great relief from gel injections in her knee. I have been having trouble with  my knees for sometime. My right knee really got bad. I had x-rays showing osteoarthritis. I brought them to Dr Hanna. Unfortunately, after three injections , I was getting no relief. In fact my pain was the same.  He sent me to get an MRI. So grateful because I got to have the MRI and he read the results quickly. As it turned out, there was a lot of damage to my knee, different tears and bulges, etc. Dr. Hanna  had me come in a few days after for a Cortizone injection and put me on a course of anti-inflammatory pills. At this moment, my knee is feeling much better. He did also suggest I follow up with the orthopedic surgeon. Since there are so much damage and gel injections, won't help me. I don't know what I would've done without him. The
Attention and care I got was extraordinary and was very comforting. I'm not sure what my future holds for  my knees.  Dr Hanna  is not a surgeon, and he may be able to keep me from surgery a bit longer. He is a great physician, wonderful at pain management  and a great human being.|Dr. Patel helped me with my back pain. She took the time to explain everything she planned to do, which helped me understand what was going to happen. During the procedure, Dr. Patel and her team made sure I was comfortable and well taken care of. They were kind and professional, which made a big difference. Additionally, the front-of-the-house staff are very professional. I'd recommend Dr. Patel to anyone with back problems. She's Great!|Dr. George Hanna is very professional and knowledgeable pain management skill Doctor. He help relieve my knee pain issues. His staff is very kind and make you feel welcome. Very clean place.  I highly recommend Dr. George Hanna. He's also very friendly and kind.|I've been seeing Dr. George Hanna for pain management of a chronic spine condition for well over a year. He is the 6th pain specialist I've seen over a 15 year period and is by far the best. Dr. Hanna seems to understand my bone disorder and the misery it causes best and is tenacious about battling the insurance company to cover treatment deemed unnecessary by them. He has a wonderful bedside manner, is highly professional, and extremely knowledgeable, conscientious, and compassionate. While it has been an adjustment not to receive oral pain medication unless deemed absolutely necessary, I follow his reasoning for prudent dispensing of prescriptions and respect the decision as it's ultimately in the best interest of the patient.

Of all of the pain specialists I've been treated by, I have made the largest improvement in well-being under Dr. Hanna's care and referred my daughter for management of her herniation related pain. The office is also very clean and organized.

While the staff was friendly and the facility pleasant, the overall care felt like a ""patient mill"" with minimal individualized attention.

There was no clear treatment plan, no guidance on how often to do my exercises, rest, or signs to watch for in order to progress safely. I only received this information after I inadvertently irritated my tendon a few weeks in. Additionally, there was no oversight or assessment of my progress during sessions. The assistant who was supposed to observe wasn't paying attention to my form, even when there were no other patients.

Despite being told I was 'behind' at my last session, I hadn't received any progressive loading or more challenging exercises. I feel like I wasn't given the necessary information or oversight to ensure safe progress.

For the price and time commitment, I expected more personalized care. If you're looking for targeted guidance, I wouldn't recommend this place.|Dr. Kapadia is an exceptional physiotherapist who takes the time to truly understand his patients' concerns.

Dr. Abrakhimov treated me a couple of weeks ago and I feel so much better! My quality of life was restored in just one visit. Today was my follow-up appointment and Dr. Abrakhimov was contented with my progress. I am very grateful to the Doctor and his wonderful staff. I would definitely recommend Elite Pain Management to my family and friends. Thank you!  Excellent!!!|Arrived early for a cervical injection appointment and then not called to desk until 45 minutes after appointment time, just to collect the copay.

Took copay and then I had to wait another 10 minutes to get vitals done and sign papers. Back to waiting room, waiting again for the previous patient to be finished, the room to be cleaned.

I clearly explained that I have a pickup at 1:45pm, and all everyone can say is, ""I understand"".

No obvious delays as other patients came in, had their procedure done and left.

Did you forget about me? Or did you just ignore me, shuffling my chart to the bottom of the pile? I did observe that I was the only person of brown complexion in the waiting room on both days (initial visit and procedure visit). Maybe the reason.

No you don't care, it's all about the money, the numbers, how many bodies can you do, not the patient's time. At no time did ANYONE says, we're running behind, this or that happened. And with others coming and going you were not behind by over an hour.

I'm on time (early even) and when I'm ready to leave, now you're almost ready for me. By the time I'm in the Access A Ride car, they are calling me, asking me to come back inside that the doctor is ready for me (it's 1:27pm).

How can you even justify having a new patient waiting an ***hour and 15 minutes*** AFTER their appointment time for their procedure? And think it's okay.

No I don't recommend this practice/doctor. No I will never go back.

Take your pain elsewhere, to someone who will respect your time.

So far, I've gotten the SGB and EBOO procedures and I can't say enough about how great they're making me feel. SGB was a game-changer for me, and I consider it one of the best things I've done as a biohacker. It has made everything I do more enjoyable. And maybe part of that is placebo but for sure there's something about this that's not placebo. Because I've been in high pressure situations that would usually trigger some discomfort and my experience now is markedly different. I'm definitely calmer and any negative feedback loop that I had in my head is muted.

I just did the EBOO yesterday and I'm feeling great today. I'll update my review later. :)

No sympathy. Waited for the dr for almost 2 hours when asked where was the dr (Dr. Kogan)? They said he had a procedure when my appointment was at 1:30pm. Clearly this doctor cared for business and not the patient.  And absolutely shows no sympathy for old patients.

Am happy I met him & I trust him with my health in the future, not forgetting his beautiful team from the front desk to his assistant in the Or room, nursery Theresa is very friendly & patient
Thank you pain solutions|Dr. Kogan is a wonderful doctor. I came in with so much pain but he quickly found options to help. I recommend him to anyone with pain. The staff are wonderful and very respectful. Even help with translation in spanish.|I've seen both doctors at this location. One is very kind and great at his job. The other assaulted me, injured my already injured shoulder, and pinned me down to a table with his groin while he was injuring me and screaming at me to go to physical therapy (which I do 2-3x a week, though he never asked if I went and just decided to scream in my face out of nowhere instead). It took my PT 3 weeks to fix the damage he did.

I had a new severe injury that impaired my ability to move and breathe. Doc (the good one) scheduled me for trigger point injections. I arrive on time, do the paperwork, sit down, wait for an hour. Have to go to the bathroom (no toilet tissue) and ask how long the wait might be when I ask for toilet tissue. They say 5 procedures ahead of me after I've already waited an hour. I walked over in excruciating pain, in a severe storm and tornado warning. I'm physically unable to sit or stand long due to my conditions, and they were about to have me waiting 5+ hours for a 5min procedure. They were never going to say a word. I had to leave for work.

They asked if I wanted to be rescheduled to the following week. Why? So I can cancel another important medical appointment, unexpectedly wait 5+ hours for a 5min procedure again, and still get no treatment? I can go untreated at home, so why go through the hassle? It seemed like one of the doctors called out or something, which happens, but you inform patients. You don't just expect people to wait several hours in pain and in severe weather warnings (we're being told to stay home unless leaving for something absolutely urgent right now) without a word. They were not busy, both front desk people were just sitting there the whole time, so they absolutely could have informed us.

Added bonus was the drunk as can be patient tossing flower pots around and breaking them? That was bizarre, though ultimately not the staff's fault.

Now I'm stuck with this severe pain made worse by the wait, walking in the severe weather, etc. and I have zero options for treatment.

They do really care and want to help, if you aren't getting adequate help from the front desk, there are people in the background that are willing to assist if your case is justified. They spent alot of time with me working through the intracies of my issues and clearing it with insurance.

I recently went here for my pain management needs and this office is terrible. They make the process of booking an appointment challenging, send texts with incorrect information, and constantly have long wait times.

Ive been trying to get my prescription issue remediated for an extended period of time and the individuals using the chat system they force you through provide minimal help.|My wife is a patient at this location for the past year. She's being treated for chronic pain due to multiple years of hernia surgeries,lower back & hip pain. Unfortunately, for the past,approximately, 9 months there has been frequent delays with prior approval for her medications. My wife has been without her medications from 4 to 5 days due to issues with prior approval. The system of communication with the pain clinic is strictly through a messaging system called (Klara) and by leaving voice messages which brings you back to Klara messaging. Sometimes the response from the clinic is within acceptable waiting time and sometimes no one from the clinic responds at all. If the patient has an upcoming injection procedure and your medication is due, the prior approval for picking up your medication will be delayed until the procedure is done. In other words if you're supposed to pick up your medication,for example, on April 1 and your upcoming procedure is on April 5, you will have wait until April 5,after the procedure, in order to get the prior approval for your pills. Therefore, if you run out of medicine on April 1, you will be without meds for days and that is where the problem begins because the patient, as in my wife's case, has no medicine to manage her pain. This creates pain,suffering,stress,worry,frustration, because she can't manage her pain and when she messages the clinic, they don't answer. Another thing is that this clinic prescribes medication every 2/weeks as opposed to every month. I hope this clinic can make corrections soon so that patients can continue to receive ultimate pain management  treatment without any interruptions. Update as of 1/2025. There has been improvements with communications via phone from the pain clinic and via Klara. The prior approvals have also improved. I'm not sure what the issues were previously,however,things are running smoothly  and my wife who is the patient at this clinic so far is receiving excellent  pain management services by Dr. Do our and her PAs. Also, initial contact with front desk secretaries are cordial and customer service oriented.|I have had to call and message over ten times on one occasion and visit the practice in person to chase them up because they hadn't sent a prescription that I needed.
It was a medication which I can't abruptly stop so it was very dangerous to run out.
If you can go anywhere else, do not go here.
They are completely negligent and dangerously understaffed.|I have been a patient of Dr. Do Ouro for over 10 years. She has from day one treated me with dignity and respect. She always listens to my concerns and has always put my needs above anything else. She always looks out for the benefits of her patients and not the latest governmental or industry trends. In a world which is putting more pressure on doctors to do less Dr. Do Ouro does more.  I consider her family she truly has giving me and continues to give me a better quality of life!|My mom has been seen by Dr. Do Ouro for the past year due to chronic pain from multiple back surgeries. Although Dr. Do Ouro is a great doctor, very compassionate and understanding with her patients, the communication with her office is awful. They NEVER pick up the phone and take over a week to respond via Klara (Communication Platform)
Also, they failed to send medical reports to the attorney and insurance company which resulted in my mom's workers compensation payments to be suspended.
We will have to change her pain doctor due to this extreme lack of communication.|I can't tell you how lucky I am to have her change my life. She managed my pain so different in a way with new techniques. I am so grateful the staff is so wonderful. I recommend this pain Management before any other. She is an expert in a field that Most of Other doctors do not treat you properly. Thank you so much, Dr D!! And very much appreciate everyone that works. Her team is the best.!!!! Very professional!|After a few procedures, I was standing at the counter for hours baking bread and other items. It had been SOOOO LONG since I was able to do that!!! Now my back and neck issues, degenerative disc disease and occasional impingement, etc, are permanent. I'm not looking for a cure, I just wanted to be able to have a DECENT quality of life. They do wear off but the procedures are done right there..in office. Using to rooms in the back that looks just like an OR in a big hospital!! Anesthesia on site. Sleep for 15-20 minutes and DONE!!
Dr DoOuro has done what no other doctor has been able to. I no longer cry in my bed thinking it's just getting worse and I can't do anything......I can't say enough about her!! I must also comment on her staff. To run 2 operating rooms and keep it moving smoothly, makes her staff some of the best I've seen (I've seen A LOT). You know the saying,"" moves like a well oiled machine "", well Dr Do Ouro and her wonderful staff, keeps things moving like a well oiled machine!! In case you can't tell, I HIGHLY recommend her and staff at the 2nd Ave 42nd St office.|If it was not for Dr.DoOuro I would have not been able to continue work and provide for my family. I have been a patient of her for almost 20 years now.
I have severe spinal stenosis had surgery and nothing helped . Just do what she says follow her lead even if you do not agree with her .
They are strict with opioids and they should be because many people abuse these meds and make it hard for those who really  need them
Asya whi is her PA is just great and does a wonderful job in getting you out of pain.

Dr. Elbaz and Dr. Kim have the best bedside manner I've ever experienced. They have compassion and a genuine desire to help which comes across to the patient from the very first appointment. They make you feel safe and listened to about your pain concerns. There's nothing better than feeling like a person when trusting a doctor with your pain and life. After a serious car accident, my insurance would cover many doctor visits and potential surgeries, but after surpassing their unrealistic time limit, I wasn't able to schedule with any doctors. That was when I was referred to Dr. Elbaz and his team. He reassured me his job was to help make me feel better and we would let the lawyers deal with the money. Immediately he got to work on figuring out how best to help me. Dr. Elbaz and his team performed a discectomy on my lower back which had me in excruciating pain daily for over a year. I found myself unable to bend down to shave my legs, tie my shoes, in addition to having discomfort and difficulty standing and/or sitting. The recovery time for the discectomy performed on me took longer than anticipated, but after I fully recovered, I felt significantly less pain in my lower back and could resume shaving my legs. Although I sustained multiple injuries and experience pain all over, Dr. Elbaz and his team have helped and continue to help me feel better than days and years before.

Mount Sinai Pain Management Program

an extraordinarily gifted doctor and someone possessed of the kind of empathy that is so rare (and so great) to find in someone as young as he... Dr. Daniel Kanzer, by virtue of his thoroughness, has quite possibly saved me from life in a wheelchair...
taking over as my pain management doctor after my primary care physician of 30 years retired late year before last. we met each month and on one visit early last spring, he asked if my pain was worse and i said..""about the same, i think.."" and he said, ""well, your body language says something else, so lets get an MRI of your back, just to see... the MRI showed a problem and Dr. Kanzer insisted that i see my neurosurgeon (the same doctor who performed a laminectomy and a multi-level fusion on my lumbar spine  11 years ago) ASAP ... i did and was told that i had severe stenosis which had caused the buckling of my cauda equina nerve root,  something that would require a major operation in order to avoid the almost inevitable eventuality of becoming permanently crippled by the severing of my spinal cord... i had the operation 5 months ago and was informed by both my surgeon and the attending physician from the spine center at NYU that it would be an intense experience with a long and unavoidably painful period of rehab that might take a year or more to heal...(they inserted two 15-inch steel rods from my sacrum to my mid-thorasic spine, replacing the extant apparatus in the process).
Daniel has been with me throughout this ordeal, making certain that my pain has never been more than i can handle and , for this, i will be eternally grateful...
i spent two months at in-house rehab and am now finishing my third month of out patient sessions...we have lowered the dose of pain meds from the extremely high level, i was on, for the first couple of months, post-op...back to the maintenance dose i was taking pre-op. Dr. K has closely monitored my progress and with great compassion (and a marvelous sense of humor) helping me to  ""maintain the strain""

In Conclusion, i give Dr. Kanzer and the Mount Sinai Pain Management Program my highest, unqualified recommendation for anyone suffering from the unrelenting pain of any severe back problem...

Thanks again , Doc...I am so very happy that my current PrimaryCarePhysician (who retired into private practice after years as chief cardiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital) recommended that i apply to your program...!

sincerely...your patient (and friend),

March 2024|Dr Serben is the pain God. Had sciatica so bad in 2014. I'd rather have had a few toothaches and been in labor than that horrible pain. I couldn't even sleep in my bed  Slept in my recliner when I could sleep. Went to a few pain Dr's with no relief.   Then my pcp referred me to Dr Serben. Been b pain free. He did an epidural HE got the right spot. Excellent at his profession. Will not do or give any treatment or medication that isn't good for your issue.  The Best at Mt Sinai|Dr. Serbin does not get back to his patients. I had a family member that needed their medication. His team or him did not get back to them. They had to suffer for weeks.
He is a horrible person and doctor|Dr. Serban is a great pain doctor, dare I say the best in NYC without actually having been to each and every one of them myself. While he's prudent, he's always suggesting new approaches to deal with my pain issues. He's willing to discuss new approaches and dissuade me from any treatment if he thinks it's unsuitable for me. He cares deeply about this patient and I'm sure it's true of all his patients. Importantly to me, I haven't found a doctor in NYC who is better at treating Adhesive Arachnoiditis (AA), the source of my particularly vicious form of pain. A doctor both skilled at, and willing to even attempt to treat AA is a rare find even in a place as big as NYC. To find someone like Dr. Serban who both wants to and is very good at treating AA and is very compassionate on top of it all, is a very rare combination indeed.
As is probably the case with all Five Star doctors, getting an appointment with Dr. Serban, even rescheduling an appointment, may result in a very long wait. There is no getting around the fact that Dr. Serban is in very high demand and we all want to be treated as if we're his most important patient. This is where the Practice's scheduling person's telephone skills make or break its reputation, and to some degree the doctor's too. If a patient can't be made to feel special by getting the best appointment in the book, then shouldn't the bad news be delivered in such a way as to make that patient feel like he/she is still valued by the doctor and Practice. More often than not the message either doesn't get sent at all, or gets sent in a way that makes the patient feel even worse.|Ive been seeing Dr.Serbian for 8yrs and the only thing that im disappointed with is when I was in the hospital Dr.Serbian didnt even come and see me.|horrible wait times for everything, to be seen, get an appointment calling in HORRIBLE - people who work there DONT CARE - OUTDATED facilities worst|",2024-03-03|2023-04-25|2023-11-21|2019-03-03|2018-01-22|2022-12-05|2019-12-18,5|5|1|5|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Hello,

Dr. Allen takes a holistic approach to treatments and minimizes the use of opioids and other medication. The staff is always warm and welcoming. As someone who has suffered from chronic pain for over thirty years, and has had my share of inadequate pain treatment, I can fully recommend Dr. Allen and NEW York Pain Medicine.|I've been a pain control patient with several different doctors since 2001. While I've been happy enough with all of those doctors, after working with Dr. Allen for the last few months I actually feel like I'm getting something more out of my treatment. He asks questions and those questions have helped me to think differently about how to control my chronic pain (from Crohn's disease and multiple abdominal surgeries). He pays attention, and I don't feel like just another file on his desk. He's even helped me with other pains I've been experiencing for years but never talked about, I assumed they were the price of aging. He put me in touch with Tania, New York Pain Medicine & Physical Therapy's in-house Physical Therapist. Now, those aches and pains are being treated, without the need for more medications, on top of my chronic issues! Tania has been brilliant, I'm walking with less pain these days, and had no idea this was even a possibility. In a short few months I have learned more about how my body mechanics work and how I react to pain medication than I have learned over 20 years in and out of the hospital. Finding a new doctor is difficult and reception for new patients isn't always pleasant. However, Caroline (whom seems to run the whole show behind the scenes) has made that experience not only pleasant, she's kind, welcoming and helpful. I recently met Melesia who is new behind the desk and the same can be said of her. Even if I'm feeling terrible before my appointments I always leave smiling, thanks to the whole team Dr. Allen has built. I only wish it didn't take me 22 years to find this place!|I was referred to Dr Allen for severe back pain. I ended up needing disc surgery but I highly recommend him and Allison, his PT. He is knowledgeable and kind. Allison does one on one therapy in a private room. She is great. A small office so perfect during COVID.|Dr allen is very caring and kind . Takes his time to explain things as well . I have seen a few drs for pain management and he is the only one who has listened and made me feel comfortable which is important. He has also helped me manage my health and is always there when i have a question which is very rare. I recommended him to some of my own patients because i am a provider as well and everyone has had the same positive experience. He also has a great team for PT ,acupuncture, and front desk.|Dr. Allen has been extremely helpful to me in managing chronic back pain and deciding on treatment options. From my first visit he has helped me to understand the nature of my injury, potential options for treatment, and the pros and cons of each method. It is clear to me that Dr. Allen sees patient education as being of primary importance so that the patient can, along with the doctor, make informed decisions about treatment. His advice and feedback regarding potential treatment is generally conservative, which I appreciate. I would recommend Dr. Allen without hesitation to someone suffering from acute or chronic back or neck pain.|Dr. Allen has been my pain management doc for a little over four years and I couldn't recommend him more. He's friendly and attentive and has always managed my care professionally. If you want someone who is going to talk to you for two minutes and throw pills at you, he's not your guy. If you want someone who will actually work with you to help you and get you feeling better, there is no one better.|I was beyond impressed with my experience at this office.  Dr. Douglas Allen and The Physical therapist Aleks Setcha are all I could have hoped for with pain management.  I received the best advice and treatment during every visit. Dr. Allen is extremely knowledgeable and positive.
My pain has clearly improved with Aleks  who is so dedicated and intelligent. I can get around much more than before, changing my life for the better.I am truly grateful for both of them  I would definitely recommend this practice to anyone that values their health and wants an empowering experience.|I had an excellent visit with Dr. Allen for my back pain. He's a good doctor who doesn't talk down to you and has empathy for your problem. Plus he loves heavy metal which gives him instant credibility with me! I will continue to see Dr. Allen because he is thoughtful and helped me with my problem.",2023-07-27|2023-06-20|2021-08-11|2019-10-25|2014-11-19|2019-03-12|2016-07-07|2018-11-19,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJgacvMfxYwokRLQ5MLJS3mo8,36

In addition to being an expert in the field, he is a nice man. I felt very comfortable with him. i felt that he really listened, and that he understood and cared. I did a lot of research before deciding who to see for my treatment; I also consulted several other doctors before making my decision. Now, after having had my first appointment, I feel that i made the right decision with deciding to go to Dr. Kulick. His associate, Heather, is highly informed and lovely as well. This is a first-rate place to go for help.|Dr. Alex Kulick has been my Primary Care Physician for 21 years. He is one of the best diagnosticians practicing medicine as a curative profession.  He listens, he asks pertinent questions, he does not waffle, he respects you and the issues that brought you to him that day. He is kind. He is gentle. He gives each patient the time they require. And, most importantly, he has solutions. He is conservative about surgery, unless all other options have been exhausted. He has a responsive and friendly front office team.|Dr. Alexander Kulick is an amazing diagnostician. His experience as head of the ER at a major New York City hospital has given him the ability to get at the root cause of your concerns by actively listening to both verbal and nonverbal cues from you to arrive at a recommendation.
I was being treated for a car accident and was told by my orthopedic surgeon I would need to live with the pain in my neck and lower back for the rest of my life, after three treatments with Dr. Kulick I've been pain-free for the last 15 years.|I first saw Dr Kulick for a very painful sciatica condition. Several top surgeons said I needed to have spine surgery.

Dr. Kulick examined me and, using his utrasound machine and manual palpation, decided the problem was localized to my back and legs -- no spinal involvement. He applied injections (under ultrasound) at key points -- about 20 in all. This had the IMMEDIATE effect of relieving my sciatica by roughly 90%. A few more visits completed the treatment.

Dr. Kulick is a true miracle worker. He listens to you attentively, is curious, gracious, and warmhearted. And genuinely competent, having trained in emergency and internal medicine, acupuncture, and several other modalities.

Since that first visit, about 10 years ago, I have used him for pretty much all of my primary care needs. He is more than capable of diagnosing and treating a wide range of conditions (not just pain-related), having worked in an emergency care setting for close to two decades. When necessary he will send your blood for lab analysis and will personally follow up with you if something is amiss.

I unhesitatingly recommend Dr. Kulick. He is almost always on time for appointments, and you will never feel rushed by him once you are in his office. He is careful to space out his appointments so you will get seen within minutes of arrival. This is despite the fact that he has a loyal following of hundreds of patients. People come from around the world to see him.

A word about the office staff. They really go out of their way to be accommodating and to make you feel welcome -- this especially includes his office manager and longtime assistant Heather. The office itself, occupying the ground floor of a townhouse on East 61st Street, is totally cozy, with an assortment of comfortable armchairs.|Dr. Kulick is a savior, of sorts.

He saved me from chronic nerve pain stemming from my C6/C7 herniated disc, that I endured for a few years on and off.  Before meeting with Dr. Kulick, I met with many other health care practitioners and tried cortisone shots into my neck, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, CBD (both ingested and topical), positive thinking, learning more about Dr John Sarno's work and practicing some of his methods, etc.

Dr. Kulick was able to, after two treatments, completely eradicate my pain.  Leading up to meeting with him, my last round of nerve pain made it very difficult to function.  Not an easy time to say the least.  I was beginning to lose hope and started to look into a potential neck surgery and, finally, after years of trying to avoid surgery as an idea, even met with a cervical spine surgeon.  I decided to give Dr. Kulick a shot and I'm extremely grateful I did.  Due to his work and expertise, I pain-free and have not needed surgery.  I am fully functional again and feel like I've gained my life back.

Additionally, he is a rare breed of a person.  Very caring, very kind, funny, respectful, listens well, and is extremely competent and intelligent in pain management.  Great knowledge and practical experience in truly caring for and helping people.  A beautiful person and  I am very grateful I got to meet him.

Lastly, his team member Heather is very communicative, professional, caring, and makes you feel very welcome.  She is a great person also and a true pleasure to speak with.|Dr. Kulick is a very personable physician who employs a novel style of treatment: he focuses on the precise part of the nervous system which causes the problem and cures it in the least invasive way.  He and his staff provide very good follow-up.|Dr. Kulick has been amazing at treating my pain for many years. I see him every time I'm back in New York, and recommend him to all of my friends and family. Thank You Dr. Kulick!|I have received immediate relief from extreme pain.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Siefferman to anyone seeking the Number One New York Physician specializing in: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and Interventional Pain and Headache Medicine.|In my experience, many pain management injections with other physicians have been literally hit or miss. Dr Siefferman was quite literally on point and the injections provided  very important diagnostic information and significant but as expected, temporary relief.|I became a patient of Dr. Siefferman's six months ago after seeing multiple doctors and having multiple procedures which other physicians told me ""failed."" Of course I felt like I failed. I was in severe pelvic pain. I felt an initial first glimmer of hope after my first consultation when Dr Siefferman proposed examining different body parts he thought could be related to my pain. He seemed shocked none of my other doctors had done any imaging of any body parts either. Six months later my pain levels are much lower and I have much more hope about my future.
I have found Dr Siefferman to be very extraordinary in every regard. His calm, kind manner is always reassuring and he is very easy to talk to. He is very understanding and as a female I can speak to him about the most personal of subjects. He collaborates with my medical and mental health team and always returns emails.

He makes you laugh during procedures and makes you feel truly heard. I highly recommend him for pain management!|I am not one to generally write reviews but if you or a loved one have pain, this is the one doctor you will wish you met years earlier.

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Siefferman and every person I've encountered at his practice, Manhattan Pain Medicine. He is knowledgeable and thorough, has a wonderful bedside manner that can calm anxiety in one conversation, and has an extensive range of effective treatment options. He has taken my daughter, who had been suffering from chronic, unbearable pain, and a deterioration of her physical well-being, and begun to turn it around. There are multiple issues at play but with his broad knowledge, he was able to apply a holistic perspective that other doctors hadn't, which enabled him to begin teasing apart the various issues at play. This understanding, along with several treatment options, gave us a renewed sense of hope.

Dr. Siefferman is astute, aware, and has a gentle way of sharing challenging information so it can be received without feeling judged. His compassion and concern for every aspect of a patient and their families' well-being is palpable and this commitment feels shared by every person in his office.

That was fine, I didn't want to start new with another clinic so I coped. I then had a procedure done there which has made me worse (injections into a tendon to heal it actually damaged the tendon further and now I can't bend my knee 3mos later). I had 4 telehealth sessions scheduled to discuss this, but the doctor no-showed to all 4. I took off work and he just didn't show up, 4 times in a week, so then I just gave up on seeing them.

Then, I received my EOB from my insurance and learned that the office had charged me double what my insurance authorized. When I contacted them for a refund and provided copies of my EOB, they never replied (this was almost 2 months ago). That one is actually insurance fraud, so not a great look.|This place does not honor appointment times. My appointment was scheduled for 2pm. I ended up leaving at 345 as I still had not been seen.

She finally reffered me but I needed another mri. The next morning the office manager called me, excited, to inform me my claim for an mri was denieeeeed. I called the pre approval company & they informed me my claim was not denied. The doctors office didn't sent over my records after numerous requests.if they didn't receive my records by 12 noon, my claim would be denied. It was 8:45am. By 12 noon the doctor still did not send my records & the preapproval company faxed a denial to the doctor. After 3 pm, the doctors office finally sent my records knowing they received the denial. I was able to get a human being, who was also black & suffered from sciatica,  to put through an appeal. They approved me in a few hours. I was able to get my mri. I complained to the chair of the department but she informed me she spoke to those involved & what else did she want me to do. Medical racism at its finest. I went out of network since they went to great lengths to deny me treatment. Unfortunately, my new doctor retired & I haven't been able to get pain injections in months.

All of the staff in that area of the office was totally on point today and I really appreciate the help and care that I received today.

Don't believe the hype and her high profile appearance because she won't listen to your real causes for pain, dismissed your pertinent past medical procedures, test results, scan history, and medical records. Her staff will also lie about giving you numbness meds before steroid injection procedure is beyond immoral and unethical.
Clinic is a shamble not for pain management at all.|Dr. Alexis is very nice and compassionate. I've been to the Manhattan office and Staten island office. I prefer the Manhattan office. Everyone is nice and friendly there. The Staten island office (Victory Blvd) was not as friendly at least the front desk and the appointment person. However the staff for procedures were nice. I've been seeing Dr. Alexis for a few months and he has been very attentive and understand. He discusses procedure carefully and asks for my opinion. I recently was introduced to Dr. Chapman and he was attentive and informative as well. I would recommend both Dr. Alexis and Dr. Chapman. However locations I would stick to the Manhattan unless absolutely necessary to travel to Staten island (Victory Blvd). Can't say anything of the other locations though.

The atmosphere is totally professional and his staff exhibits a genuine caring attitude unsurpassed by any other doctors office I've ever encountered.  It takes a deep trust to allow someone to stick a needle into your spine and Dr. Chapman has earned that trust repeatedly.  As far as the unflattering reviews I have read, I am completely shocked that any patients would have a complaint. Dr
Chapman , in my experience, has always taken time to speak and address any concerns I may have no matter how big or small. Furthermore, Dr. Chapman doesn't speak down to you as some other physicians have a habit of doing. I was there today, every staff member, every nurse greeted me with a smile, asked if I was comfortable and kept me in the loop every step of the way
To Dr. Chapman and all of you wonderful RNs don't ever change. You're great the way you are. To the PA's and ladies who make my appointments and answer my emails in a flash I want to give you a shout out too, you're the best and my family and I feel you're worth your weight in gold. So, to all out there if I could give one piece of advise it would be  to put your faith in Dr. Chapman's hands.|Dr. Chapman and his staff were professional and personable. I honesty have never had a more pleasant experience with respect to service in the health care industry. I highly recommend this office and encourage  you to chose this office for pain management.

I highly recommend going to Dr. Akuamoah if you have spine, lower back, neck, knee and other arthritic issues.!!|I have been going to the office on Hylan Blvd for over two years after being referred there by the Staten Island Hospital.  My doctor is Robert Outterbeck.  After multiple ""procedure's"" I still remain in as much pain as when I went into the emergency room over two years ago.  I was never even asked if I needed anything for pain. Now he's telling me of a procedure called ""The Mild Procedure"". Before every procedure they require a medical release form from your doctors office.  MAKE SURE you do this in person since their office staff seems to be unable to get these forms via fax for whatever reasons.  In addition be prepared to go thru several hoops depending on which doctors clearance they want.  I hand delivered a completed form from my heart doctor giving clearance, that wasn't good enough.  Several days later they wanted one from my primary care doctor, then one from my kidney specialist.  Once again they were sent faxes that they said thy never received.

Dr. Hunter performed a radiofrequency ablation to the ganglion of impar and gave me my life back. I now come back to NYC every couple of years to get the procedure for pain management.

She said Dr Leung made her knee feel "" like a million bucks after a week"".
Well my husband's knee  does feel like a million bucks after a few days post arthrocentesis. Well done, Dr Leung. I would recommend you to anyone. The best there is.|I have had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Leung for more than 7 years. He has treated me in the past for everything from foot to back to knee pain.  He is always thorough and honest with his care.  Although my insurance (GHI) does not cover Acupuncture, he has always been reasonable with his fees.  I am grateful to have found a Doctor who is as talented and affordable as Dr. Leung.|I've had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Leung for a number of years now.  While some of the office policies may seem archaic, I have grown accustomed to them. This office does not take credit card. Only cash or check. It may seem like a bother to some but his rates are more than reasonable. I also know to call ahead of time if I'm running late or I will lose my place on the schedule. I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes for my scheduled appointments. I am very happy with the quality of services that they have provided me.|Dr. Leung and his staff are very professional. Office is welcoming, clean and organized. I called and was able to secure an appointment the same day at 1pm. I was greeted warmly by the office staff and was taken in immediately. (Normally at a doctors office I have to wait 30mins before getting into a room and then wait there). I saw Dr. Leung (Jonathan) about my ankle. I had a terrible sprain after playing bball and thought it might possibly be broken. Dr. Leung was great. He has a very calm and reassuring demeanor. He explained everything in detail even taking out the model ankle to provide an explanation of how my ankle and its ligaments can be affected. He made me feel better with his diagnosis, pretty much telling me it was most likely a sprain instead of a break. He provided some recommendations on how to take care of my ankle and even gave me a ace bandage to wrap my foot in. I'd highly recommend Dr. Leung and his office! A+|My husband came to visit Dr. Leung for his wrist pain problems. We have been visiting Dr. Leung for a while, he has always been patient and listened attentively to my husband's concerns and questions. My husband's's condition gets better after the visits. Dr. Leung is knowledgeable in his field and can be relied on treating pain problems.|I have been treated by Dr. Leung and his father in the past for many years. I have always found them to be professional, courteous and diligent with my care. When they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Dr. Leung is no exception to the rule.  I trust them both with the care of my family and myself.|Dr. SABIN the accupuncturist at Dr. LEUNG is fabulous and has helped my chronic sciatica and spinal stenosis.
