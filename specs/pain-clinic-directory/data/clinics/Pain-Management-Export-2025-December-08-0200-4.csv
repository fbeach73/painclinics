I've been calling to have my appt rescheduled, I will now suffer from withdrawal side effects MOST LIKELY HOSPITALIZED which you are going to be held responsible! Pretty sure my lawyer will have fun with this case.
Next time COMMUNICATE with your patient!
And slowly ween off.|Not a medical appointment at all. I have waited 2 months only to be bullied and berated by a doctor because I was honest about my pain med use. Dr Griver was so much more professional.  A 5 minute app. only to be referred elsewhere. The man is loud and a bully.|Absolutely love the Dr. that took over the practice. He's very knowledgeable, likeable, and professional. I've been seeing Kerri Orr for a few years and she is the best PA there is! I highly recommend Comprehensive pain management in Wilkes Barre!|I have always been greeted.  The staff is wonderful very pleasant.  It's easy to set up an appointment or change one.
They call with reminder appointment notices.
There's less then a 15 minute wait.
Medication refills can be called in easily.
There's always a phone after a procedure is done.
I've never had a problem. Dr.Paz and staff are the best in the county.|I went for my last visit last month in December and they did a routine urine test and I've been on Oxycodone for years now and that's all i take is my prescriptions and nothing else but what I'm prescribed, next thing i know I'm getting a certified letter in the mail telling me that i had Vicodin in my system when i can't even take that... I Love Kerri Orr and for the first time i didn't see her and all of a sudden this happened, they didn't even write on my bottle this time like they usually do they just left it sitting there, but I'm getting accused of something i didn't do... And I've never even met the Doctor yet go figure... So now I'm going to be going through withdrawals like crazy because I've been on them for so long... I MISS DR GRIVER HE WAS THE BEST DR EVER!!! And One more thing I feel bad for the person that they got my uren mixed up with that takes the Vicodin and ended up with the Oxycodone in their system instead, because that's what happened, they are the ones that messed up and we have to take the blame for it and it's not fair at all because God forbid if they do something wrong they don't do anything wrong they never make a mistake....|Absolutely horrible ! Dr Paz.   An MRI was needed but Dr Paz did nothing f to make it happen!! I had to go throu numerous phone calls to get it scheduled. Then after results were received Dr Paz office couldn't even bother to give me results!! I have a right to the results of a test that was very expensive !! Don't go there if you want communication with the Dr or don't expect to get in touch with them!! They don't return calls!!!!!!!!!!! Very disappointed in this practice !!! ! No concern for heir patients whatsoever!! Stay away!!!  Even the answering service woman told me me her husband went there and Dr never got back to him , not even the office!!!!!

There is a large sign on the window at the front desk warning patients not to knock or tap on the window.  So if there is no one behind the window, you just sit and wait?

(He isn't a doctor, he is a chiropractor) My mother has been dealing with severe back pain (ruptured disc, herniated disc, and arthritis) for over 12 years, and has tried over the counter medications, natural supplements, yoga, physical therapy, and found no relief. She FINALLY found the medicine on the dosage that works for her (everyone manages their pain differently, it is the doctor's job to analyze everyone individually) and Dr. Teller told her to take ibuprofen and try yoga. As if she hadn't tried this before. She isn't someone desperate for an opiate or trying to get her fix. She is a woman that works 12 hour days and needs to be able to get out of bed and move. She tried his recommendation, and could barely move for weeks because she was in such pain. The next time she saw him, she asked for a stomach medicine because the OTC medications were hurting her stomach. He then proceeded to YELL at her. He said, and I quote, ""Well, if it hurts your gut, why are you taking it?! That doesn't make any sense!"" She said ""Because you TOLD me to"". So unprofessional he cannot even remember what recommendations he gives to his patients. He then proceeded to go on, yelling, about how successful he is. That he can get out of bed, work out everyday, and still come to work with no pain. That's amazing, Chiropractor Teller, but you cannot tell someone else how much pain they're in. You need to listen to your patients and meet them where they're at. Disgusting. Aside from all that nonsense, she was literally taken out of the doctor's office to sit in the waiting room again, because she hadn't paid yet. Most practices accept payment after the appointment. I'm simply appalled by this place.|This service stinks they have new doctor well they cleaned them to be a doctor but their practitioner. You wait for 3 hours to be service when I call you meds in your scripts are wrong. You have to call back to get it correct and then it takes days. 69th St. office stinks that very unprofessional.  You say good morning no one responds. They even have nerve enough to put a visually impaired person through the ringer and refuse her service after two appointments.  Employees less joke around play around and do hardly any work the whole day.  They really need to be reported. Business office like that gives other business offices a poor reputation|Dr Teller and Dr Schina are committed to wellness, not just giving pain medicine. They want to ensure that we fee better long term and live a healthy and full life. I'm truly grateful for their treatment and support, recommendation, and advice on how to improve my chronic pain and symptoms from my time in the service and MVA. It's not often doctors care about helping you NOT to need them forever, and that's their goal.|The secretary was very unprofessional, she had my client sitting in the waiting are over 3 hours because he couldn't supply urine.  She knew a month ago at the last appointment that he was on dialysis again and can't produce it. I came to her at least three times to find out she never gave the doctor his paper work when we first got there, I had to get someone to cover me at my job because I was still there at that appointment. Come to find out they can do the labs by blood. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL|Don't waste your time! They schedule you for 11:20 am for injections then make you wait almost 2 hours while the whole staff "" eats their lunch"". Other more serious problems also seen that will be reported Health Department.|Timing has greatly improved, I spend no more than 1 hour in the office, I highly recommend Dr. Lorna Cheng she actually cares about your health and well-being.|ABSOLUTELY the most unprofessional doctors office I have ever been too! Do not accept Friday appointments! This is the 2nd time they have left with no way of getting a hold of anyone, that they did not phone my husbands medication to the pharmacy leaving him in pain and sick from withdrawal!

Ended up in agony all the time. Took 32 milligrams of Dilaudid and still no help. Out of desperation and no medications that help I decided to have experimental migraine surgery. The surgeon ruined every area of my head he touched. More surgeries to fix his damage. Ended up in daily agony since 2015. I finally found Dr Khan. They cannot do anything to me physically to fix my pain so I may lead a normal life.  He recommended a morphine pump. Every visit he barely spoke just kept upping my dose. After getting up to over 3mgs in my pump and still no relief. He handed me a script for Percocet.  I immediately left his unprofessional office and ended up with a new pain doctor who helped me wean off the morphine. I was down to 1/4 mg per day. Last October I had the pump removed and was so sick with opiate withdrawal from October to January.  He rarely talked to me. Made me wait in the waiting room for over two hours on one occasion.  I'd never return to see Dr Khan.|They are very incompetent when it comes to clerical work and tell you one thing and do another. They misapplied my payments and when I try to resolve the issue with them they do not do as discussed. Additionally, I requested a billing summary for my appointments to help resolve the issue and they refused. I requested a statement of my account and they provided a difficult to read report which was also not provided by date. The clerical staff require additional training. When I brought up a clerical error they made on my last appointment the supervisor Kate proceeded to say that she did not do it and after pointing it out they also refused to fix it.

She also said she would provide a better report via email and instead of providing a report she proceeded to send a me link to create an account; creating additional work for me to solve the issue.

BE SURE TO REQUEST A BILLING SUMMARY WITH THE CORRESPONDING DATES AFTER EACH APPOINTMENT.

The nurses and doctors are friendly and provide you with resources and options.|Dr Khan is hands down the best pain management Dr I have ever been to. I have had chronic pain for over 20 years and have been to alot of pain centers over those years and Dr Khan and is staff our hands down the best!!! Dr Khan truly cares about his patients he listens to you!!!! Truly cares about your health and comes up with the best way to relieve the pain. I highly recommend Dr Khan and his staff to anyone!! You will not find a better Dr who truly is compassionate and concerned about you as a person! Thanks Dr Khan and your staff for all you have done for me you have given me my life back!|Dr Khan is the best! He is so nice and very efficient. The place is very clean and getting an appointment is fast. I recommend all my family and friends to him. I've gone to other places back in the early 90s and forget it. His bedside manner puts you at ease. I would highly recommend  comprehensive pain centers  to everyone! Can't wait to get my next injection.!|I started with Comprehensive Pain Center in 2018 with neck and back issues. I received a brace for my neck and had a shot then a rhisotomy and my neck is now pain free and I can turn it freely to both sides. I am so grateful to Dr Khan he listens to you and makes a plan for you  then implements the plan. Dr Khan is highly educated and I am confident in his skills. I have a complex issue with my back and we are working on that. Right now I can walk without a cane or crutches. I feel relief and will continue to work with Dr Khan to continue treatment. I have to also say that the staff is friendly , quick to help you and they are very competent. I go to the Hazleton office, which is very quick paced and everyone stays on top of the workload. Thank you all !! If you have chronic pain this is the place to go!|Dr khan and the entire office employee staff at the comprehensive pain center seem very knowledgeable and caring in there field  of medicine. I can only  imagine the expertise it takes to judge one's pain levels, how to alleviate one's pain levels and lead them back to a normal life. For mine own personal experience it may be a long road to recovery but I know I am in good hands. Dr. Khan will guide you and talk to you in terms that are very understanding to a common person. For people seeking help with their pain management I would highly recommend Dr Khan and his team.|Overall I am very satisfied with this practice. The ladies at the front desk and in the billing dept always answer my questions in a helpful way. The nursing staff is also willing to assist you. I have not waited too long for any service. Dr. Khan will discuss my treatment options with me, and when the decision is made he completes my on-site spinal treatments efficiently.|Because of them my way of life has improved SIGNIFICANTLY. All the providers are friendly and helpfull. I have been going to them for about 5 years. Would not want to go anywhere else. I always have great conversations with Dr Khan while getting my injections. He talks to you like a normal human being and you can tell he has great personal values as well.

Dr. Bundy's knowledge, empathy, personality, attention to your needs, and treating you with dignity& respect are PARAMOUNT.He is quite an amazing doctor.

I would have given this practice 5 stars however office staff ""Sonji"" is very unwelcoming, rude, arrogant,  and conveys a very negative attitude when no other staff is around. It is very clear that she don't want to be there. This makes me very uncomfortable and when I'm finished dealing with her I feel like I never want to go back. We patients are not beneath anybody. We are going through enough pain and agony and don't need to deal with an attitude like that anywhere especially a pain control center.

In closing, I have the utmost respect for everyone that I have encountered there as they really have helped me getting relief from my excruciating back pain that I consistently experience. As far as a receptionist that is miserable, that is on her and eventually it will catch up with her.|My doctor sent me here for an epidural injection for a ruptured disc in my spine. I was so afraid of getting a shot because I've had some not-very-pleasant medical experiences in the past, but there was absolutely no reason to be (as April patiently explained, thank you!) Everyone is so friendly! They are all very highly trained, and it shows the whole time. Dr. Bundy is very kind and funny and he put me at ease immediately with a dad joke, and I could see that his eyes and face (behind the mask) were smiling. Everyone focuses on you and your needs, and you aren't rushed through prep or recovery, which is important. They really treat you very well! I look forward to seeing them when my next shot is due in a few months, as I know that I'll be well taken care of and feel better ASAP. Thank you to all of you!|Dr. Bundy and his entire staff were fantastic. He was extremely thorough despite keeping the appointment moving due to my considerable pain. The procedure was completed quickly, painlessly and professionally. I would absolutely recommend him for any pain management needs in the future.|I have been treating here for many years and am very satisfied with the care I receive. The staff is very knowledgeable, professional and caring. They are diligent in getting an understanding of and providing targeted treatment for pain issues. I have worked closely with April Palmer and Dr. Jason Bundy and am very confident in the care I receive from them. I highly recommend the Center for Pain Control.|Dr. Bundy and staff work very well to help reduce your pain to a manageable level.
Many options discussed, with your input, and their suggestions.
Friendly, personable  support staff in office, and surgical services center.
I have been a patient  for approximately  ten years, and have been able to reduce pain levels with treatment and avoid surgery(s) that may cause more limitation of mobility.
I have nothing but positive experiences with  The Center For Pain Control. They have helped me to continue living a life  with less pain, more manageable pain.
They get 5 stars from me.  I  would highly recommend  this practice.|Dr. Bundy is a caring and careful health provider. He gives generously of his time, and patiently addresses a patient's concern. The supporting staff is also very professional, and yet very pleasant. I recommend this practice strongly. My being a patient of Dr. Bundy for more than fifteen years bears testimony to my foregoing comments.|Dr. Bundy and his staff are the most diligent medical professionals I have ever met. His office staff is always welcoming and his medical assistant Brenda is wonderful.

Dr. Bundy has assisted and counselled me through some difficult post op complications....he not only understands surgical procedures he can mitigate the impact of less than optimal outcomes.

I would highly recommend Dr. Bundy for any long term chronic pain issues.

I get that the team model is common in healthcare practice, but to make an appointment with the physician and then be scheduled with the NP without any notification is disconcerting, frustrating and makes one wonder what other transparency is lacking.
It is also unsettling to have the NP then make a diagnosis and plan a treatment for the physician to perform and not be evaluated by the doctor, especially when it directly contradicts the referring physician.|Extremely friendly and competent staff.

He truly lacks compassion, his bedside manner, and women in general. Im so glad I was able to find another pain management center. They truly care about their patients and what their needs are, and what they have to say. My advice is run and never look back or even check him out as a doctor.

Dr. Garg helped me tremendously over the last few years. He has not only kept my pain in check from a botched operation in 2019 but last year he also found a problem with my heart/lungs that had nothing to do with that operation. He insisted that I had to go to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist right away. Thank goodness I did because the cardiologist told me that if I hadn't seen him, my condition would have probably killed me within 12 months! Not only is Dr. Garg a FANTASTIC physician, but his bedside manner is wonderful. He is kind, professional, VERY knowledgeable and he really cares. His wife (who runs the office) even called me once just to see how I was feeling.....she's great too! I can't say enough about Integrative Pain Clinic. They are the best!!!|I had a very positive experience working with Dr Garg this past year after developing at times crippling back and sciatic pain that interfered with all aspects of my life.

Dr Garg came highly recommended by a nurse friend of mine who knew of him through several other patients.  He was both responsive and respectful.  I appreciated his honesty and experience and his insights were extremely helpful.  I did end up with the right surgeon and had a completely successful surgery. I am now completely off all medications, but happy to recommend Integrative Pain Clinic.|I have had nothing but great experiences with Dr Garg over several years that I have been a patient. He listens with compassion and provides excellent patient care. His gentle touch when doing injections makes the process less painful and intimidating. He is very responsive to messages left for him. Thank you Dr Garg for your fantastic care!|I can't praise Dr. Garg enough for his exceptional care as my pain management specialist. From the moment I met him, his warmth and genuine concern put me at ease. Dr. Garg's expertise is unmatched, and he tailored a treatment plan that has transformed my life. His dedication to his patients is outstanding, and he and his staff create a welcoming and supportive environment. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Garg to anyone in need of a compassionate and highly skilled pain management doctor. Thank you, Dr. Garg, for making such a positive impact on my well-being!|Dr. Garg is absolutely the most kind and caring doctor. He is compassionate and takes the time to help and answer patients any time of the day. His treatment is always non judgmental. He listens and truly cares.|I have been a patient of Dr.Garg for about 10 years now and I can honestly say he is without a doubt the BEST doctor I have ever seen. The amount of care and compassion he has towards me and making sure that I have all the answers I need to get better has exceeded my expectations! There is no long wait to be seen and there is no rushing you out of the office while you are being seen. He takes his time to answer questions and to see how things are going with you and your meds. I know when I walk in that door that things are going to be ok! His wife makes the office look beautiful with decorations and makes it feel very comfortable to be there....for once a doctor that actually cares and will listen to your needs!! No assistant, nobody fake that will push you out the door just to get to the next patient...just an honest and really cool doctor and I wish there were more like him....he saved my life!|Dr Garg has been my doctor for years now.  He and his staff are nothing short of wonderful and a part of the reason I can live my life less painfully.  He has tried his absolute best to help me from having in office X-ray guided injections to referring me to surgeons when help is needed beyond his scope.  His office is not sterile looking it's fun and interesting and his waiting room and office chairs are made for people who have pain 24/7 he is a doctor who understands and does his best to help.  If I could give a hundred stars I would!  This is my first ever Google review~|I met Dr. Garg years ago when my father was his patient. He was always professional, kind, and patient in dealing with my father and whomever brought him to his visit. I became his patient years later for migraine management, and I received the same quality of care. Dr. Garg keeps up with the latest research and medical options, and is very compassionate towards his patients' struggles. Additionally, he is very timely and responsive with his communication.

They will definitely raise your blood pressure prior to your procedure. Going into a medical facility in pain and vulnerable. The Anesthesiologist that stunk of a cigarette  was complaining how she didn't need to deal with the patients today. Then when I went in to address the problem regarding my husband it became a tag team and made up stories. Very unprofessional. Doesn't matter what insurance you have.

When I say I've seen every doctor in the area... I mean every pain doctor. Dr. Bell is a God send. I've had many surgeries and multiple treatments and medications. No one has ever listened like this doctor and his staff. Wish I had found him much earlier. Full service from medication to injection therapy (nerve block, SI injections, trigger point, bursitis) and then some. I would never go anywhere else. I recommend them to anyone who is tired of pain and the treatment they are currently receiving. Not sure where the 1 star reviews are coming from...

I suffer from anxiety and they made me feel comfortable throughout my procedure,even let me look at the screen to see how my radio frequency ablation works. Explained everything before the Dr did things.|This place is a joke. I went thru the shots and ablations and all their bs to be turned away because there is nothing more they can do for me.
I was told by one doctor that I still suffer in pain because other doctors are lazy. I was so hopeful in getting help from them. They even tried talking me into thinking the ablation worked! NO it did not do anything but make me hurt more. They did not offer me one thing! No help whatsoever ever. They just said sorry and if you need anything call us. I just walked out. I been suffering with chronic pain for 20 yrs now and was on a pain med for about 9 yrs but was taken off because I got very sick with Covid so now I suffer again.
So I wrote Dr Drass a letter. Never heard a thing.
I'm glad I'm smarter than going to street drugs but I see why people do. So sad and a sad ass business. If they do not help people suffering in pain they should not be in business.
Looking still for a Doctor to even care enough to help us anymore. Don't rely on these pitiful doctors. They are needle happy! There are other things they could have offered me but did not.
I have to say the staff is great and treat you well but they do not deserve them. People are disgusted!!|I've been a patient with Allegheny Pain for many years and have the utmost respect and praise for all the staff, nurses, PA's and Dr. Drass.
Having various back issues over the years, Dr. Dress has made every attempt to get me pain relief through whatever means possible. When injections were only a short term relief for me I had to make a decision to have another surgery which Dr. Dress supported. They truly care for their patients and want only the best for them. I would highly recommend them to anyone!!!|Kim, PA, is very attentive and caring.  The staff as a whole are always friendly and professional.  I have been coming here for many, many years and highly recommended them to anyone with chronic pain issues.|I followed Dr Baber from Pittsburgh. I am driving 90 minutes to remain in his care. He's a great doctor. He listens well, doesn't treat me like a specimin, and works hard to ease the chronic pain that makes my life a struggle, which is not easy with an inflammatory disease. Many other doctors in the past have treated me like I have a psychiatric disorder or I'm exaggerating my pain. I highly recommend Dr. Baber.|First time in a year 1/2 that I've had actual care for my injury. Dr. Baber was able to answer all my questions he gave me a sense of relief that I can go about my day without pain and have control of my life again. He also made me feel vindicated that my injury is very real. The point is, he listened and actually looked at my chart. Since my injury happened I have not had that kind of care I wasn't gaslit or rushed out the door like my injury or I didn't matter. Highest of recommendations possible for Dr. Baber. The nurse that also took me back was also very kind and pleasant.|Office staff very professional and knowledgeable, also they are very pleasant!
Appointment from start to finish seems to go so fast.
Best place to come to always leave that I am in the right place!|I was referred here for neuropathy pain.  Had 2 appts.  2 copays which are very hard to get on my limited disability income.   Was told they don't treat neuropathy pain even though their website says they do after I refused an mri due to extreme claustrophobia and the presence of metal in my body.  Doctor tried to scare me with talk of painful treatments for back pain which I do not have.  If they don't treat neuropathy then why did they take my money twice and order labs for something they don't treat?   Either they discriminated against me because of my income or they assumed I'm seeking drugs.  Either way they were very rude and unprofessional.  If you don't have good insurance you may want to stay away.  Not everyone seeking help is trying to scam you.  Shame on you all.

I was a little disappointed in the fact that they did not communicate with me that they were running a bit behind so it might take longer for me to be seen.

The doctor that I saw was very patient with me i was in a great deal of pain. We discussed treatment options medication, etc... In the end I will need to try ESI as many of the meds of choice I am allergic too and the ones i am not have been 100% ineffective.
For me personally i think the exam rooms are kept a bit too cold. By the time the doc got to me i felt like i was literally freezing almost as if i had been shut in a freezer. That made my pain worse. I would have given 5 stars but these few issues made for a long day and I still had a long ride home.

While I won't know the full effects right away I can tell there is relief. I wanted to share that if anyone is Leary of injections - this doctor and staff were great. They were thorough, listeners and professional. I would have no problem repeating injections down the road ( IF ) needed.
Injections > It really sounds worse then it is.|BEWARE of this clinic's billing practices. I got a referral from my primary care physician to visit the pain clinic to explore upper back pain. For a single visit, I received three separate bills totaling $3,086. These included:

$251 for an 'office outpatient visit' to see the doctor (note: I saw a physician's assistant, PA, not a doctor)
$491 for a 'facilities charge' for entering the pain clinic
$130 for trigger point injections by the PA
$833 for a 'facilities charge' for use of the room that injections were made in
$232 for the medicine used in the injections
$1,075 for two x-rays of upper back
$74 for interpretation of the x-rays

While some of these charges are reasonable, the multiple 'facilities charges' tacked onto the bill by Mount Nittany Medical Center are simply a way to pad the billing and charge more money to patients and/or their insurance companies. The clinic warns you that there 'may be' facilities charges billed separately from provider chargers in the small print when you sign in. But if you pay out-of-pocket or have a high deductible insurance plan, you may find yourself shocked to receive a bill that not only charges you for an outpatient office visit, but that tacks on an additional 75% charge ($1,324) for the building and room that your 'office' visit occurs in. Imagine buying an airline ticket for $500 and then receiving a second bill a week later from the airport charging you an additional $375 for an airport 'facility fee'.

If you do a little research online, you'll see that medical facilities charges are a highly controversial practice in which hospital-owned outpatient clinics add charges for use of their buildings and treatment rooms. The US Congress and legislatures in numerous states are working on laws to crack down on these unethical billing practices. Until the time laws are in place to protect you, you should (a) be aware of the billing practices and use providers that don't charge facilities fees when possible; (b) report your charges to your insurance company and potentially appeal; (c) report your experience to the PA Attorney General and the Better Business Bureau to build up the number of consumer complaints required to trigger state or federal action.

(Note: Mt. Nittany posted its standard response to my review below, the same they post on every review that mentions a billing problem. But of course I contacted the billing department and got nowhere. The billing department is about as unhelpful as it gets.)|Thank you to Mt Nittany Health for the outstanding care they take for their patients.

Thank you Dr. Gilbert for all your knowledge and care to find the right injections for my condition.  She does an amazing job of finding just the perfect spot to give me pain relief.  My pain recently went from about 9 to 1.  I am so thankful.  They even call me the next day to be sure I am feeling ok or if I need anything.  Who does the anymore?  They are the best!  Kathy Greenland|You should definitely make yourself aware that this isn't a pain management clinic, it's a cancer treatment center. When my spine surgeon from Hershey tried to transition my care to here for long-term care and/or suggestions that he may not have thought of yet due to 3 spine surgeries, degenerative disc disorder and arthritis before I hit 40, they told me that they only offer pain management to cancer patients. Please change the name then. They explained that all they would ever provide would be injections, which are not FDA approved (educate yourself unless you want to end up with permanent nerve damage, or worse) and the other injections possible, I already receive from my other physician (trigger point, Botox). My surgeon was irate as I sat in the parking lot to call his office to let them know I wasted 2 months waiting for the appointment for absolutely no resolution and he has been handling my treatment from 3 hours away ever since, without hesitation, so that I don't have to give up a Ph.D. to resort to living on SSI for being unable to work normally. It's a true shame what the medical field has become. Age does not nor should it ever dictate treatment, medical diagnoses do. Pain is subjective, didn't you learn that in nursing school before you became an NP? Regardless, don't waste your time here. Mount Nittany is one of our primary providers in central Pennsylvania and residing in rural areas leaves us with very few options. It's a shame that you can't even maintain a reputable pain management clinic for patients who need it instead of having to travel 3 hours for basic care.|I went in for all the problems that I have which causes me so much pain making me not able to work or even do light house work. I have so much problems with my neck, back, and legs. A fusion & herniated disc in the neck, degenerative disc disease all through my back, bulging disc in my lower back, sciatica in my lower back & legs. and arthritis through out my whole spine, now i have to get an MRI for my knee bc it keeps locking. I have tried so many different medication which has cause some minor reactions to serious reactions. All they said was bc of my age they would not do any narcotics only injections which I was fine with but the lady doctor there did not even send in the request form to my insurance so that it would be approved and covered. When I called to find out why she argued with me saying she did when my insurance went through everything and found nothing. They are just rude and unprofessional plus I cant do injections since i have a really bad reaction to them (went to another pain management) they will not help me with the pain since i cant take anything that they can give me since they wont give me anything stronger bc of my age. If the doctors here are like the emergency room doctors I feel bad for those that are a complicated case like me bc the mount nittany ER has misdiagnosed me three times and Im sure mount nittany does not screen their doctors that well.|Dr. Gilbert and staff were wonderful. They were very nice, attentive, and answered all of my concerns from my first visit to my procedure visit. They took  time with me to explain what medical procedure they were going to do and discussed with me all the details for preoperative and postoperative of that procedure. I highly recommend them.|I've seen them all, and they've all taken the time and explained what was going on. I know Scott personally and that didn't get in the way of him being professional.

He took the time to explain every step of the process and ensured she was comfortable throughout the procedure. To our amazement, not only did the injections significantly reduce her pain, but the experience itself was far less stressful than we ever imagined, thanks to Dr. Patel's compassionate care.

He is helpful, knowlegable, and caring!
Staff is friendly  and efficient!
As a former Office Manager of a large Medical Practice..... I would have hired Dr KU's staff immediately !|Dr Ku. Is a awesome doctor and I couldn't ask for anyone better. The staff is amazing also. They are all very caring and care about your well being and Dr Ku listens to you and helps you to try to feel better 
Thanks Dr. Ku and staff your all amazing!!!|Ive been going to Dr Ku for over a year and a half now... when it comes to prior authorizations, or any other insurance matter or even just helping with other documents I've needed medical sign offs on, they're always willing to help! There is NEVER a long wait and Dr Ku ALWAYS makes a point of sitting and talking with me about whatever i need to talk about, he really takes the time to make sure you have everything you need. His staff are second to none; ..they have done some real miracles for me when it comes to dealing with insurance companies and any other issues i may have! Going to Dr Ku was one of THE BEST decisions I've ever made, and he and his staff are ALWAYS extremely professional and knowledgeable. I have recommended others to him, and will continue to do so; they're the best at what they do!|I have yet to encounter a doctor as caring and compassionate as is Dr. Ku.  This is not a ""9 minutes per patient"" office, Dr Ku has spent over 45 minutes with me on more than one occasion and always spends the time necessary to thoroughly review and discuss the situation. Your health and well-being are important to Dr Ku and this becomes obvious within the first few minutes of meeting him.  He focuses on treating the patient not the illness.  The breadth and depth of his medical knowledge is extraordinary and extends well past the parameters of his specialty.  Just as important as Dr Ku""s kindness is the attitude of the ladies that work with Dr Ku in administration and patient care.  It would be difficult to praise Dr Ku too much, he is simply an exceptional doctor and a wonderful human being.|Dr. Ku is an incredible Doctor, who truly cares about, and takes the time listen to his patients. The staff is absolutely amazing, and do whatever they can to help you. Cannot recommend this place enough.|Dr. Ku is a throw back to the old type of Doctor I remember growing up. His bedside manner is so genuine. Don't mis understand he follows the rules absolutely but when ever I had an appointment issue or any other type of life issue he has made every attempt to accommodate my schedule.  The best example is at 56 he is the only physician I see now that we discuss our families and in general have a relationship I'm not just a number. It is truly an honor to know him and his staff. he is just an all around good person.|Always a great experience with Dr Ku. By far the most compassionate and caring Dr I have ever met. I enjoy going to see him and talk to him. He doesn't just push you out the door even though another great thing is his timing. You will never wait long at all to be seen, and he does not waste any time. I have had many injections and none were like Dr Ku's. I really didn't feel any discomfort. He talked to me every second of the way, I didn't realize he had done it. He is also very accommodating. Just all around a top notch Dr and person. If you need to see him and you get an appointment, consider yourself very lucky!!!|Dr Ku has literally saved my life. He is compassionate, caring, and dedicated to his art.

They are great and truly care about a person's entire well being, not just the pain. We have seen front office staff come and go, and everyone has been friendly and professional until this past year. The heavy caucasian woman (receptionist) is a complete racist. I have witnessed her be welcoming to everyone that looks like her, and have a complete attitude when assisting my husband. She goes out of the way to make his intake difficult,  even though he has been coming to the office longer than she's been employed. She has unnecessarily rescheduled his appointments and delayed his medication paperwork. I really with the Ft Washington office would hire a new professional that can be courteous to everyone!|Dr Winas has been helping me with my never ending Spinal Cord pain in my C-spine, T-spine, Lumbar Spine, Broken R Arm, and Headaches due to a bad concussion. I have been seeing him for over 9 years now. He's my favorite Doctor. Very Professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. He has given me lots of Spinal Injections and  has never hit a nerve!  He is very qualified and a kind empathetic Doctor/Human being! I highly recommend him if you suffer from any tupe od pain.|I've been being treated by this facility, every since the gov't changed the law that your primary doctor can't write narcotic prescriptions. I went from paying $30/month to paying $125/month. I paid this change for over 3 years and a couple of times having to post date a check to keep up with the increase. I went to my scheduled appointment today to be told that we've changed our policy and no longer except post dated checks. The check was post dated for 48 hours. When I got upset about being denied service I was told that my being upset was abusive! But the fact of the matter is that if your going to change your policy then each of your clients should be notified. Not embarrassed at your office window and denied medical care. If they cared just a little about their clients and notified folks whenever they decide to change operations, things like this wouldn't happen. The doctors here are very nice but I can't say the same about the facility.|Dr. Winas is an amazing provider. Caring, patient, listens to your needs.

Rather than just treat the issue, which he said he could do, Dr Shah was more interested in finding out what caused my issue in the first place, as just treating the issue won't prevent it from happening again. Within minutes of my appointment, he recognized an underlying issue with my back that was actually the root cause of my foot pain. I've been seeing a foot doctor for months and not once did they even question what was the cause of my foot pain, it was just how do we treat it. Had I not made an appointment with Dr Shah, I would be having surgery on my feet, instead of treating the issue in my back.|From the first visit I felt at ease.

I have never met a doctor who cares so much. & as for his staff they're all wonderfully and friendly and will do everything in their power to make sure their patients are satisfied. Excellent office and staff.|I have been here for over 4 months now and I have not received any of my pain medication and I have not had any of my  Epidaurals.

The only relief in sight was medical marijuana which I registered for and paid $250 They said they are sorry but they forgot to register me for the medical marijuana program that I paid $250 for.

So now I am stuck in so much pain that I cannot go anywhere or leave the house at this point and I just found out that I will have to wait 2 or 3 more weeks now for relief so I am extremely depressed. I have been waiting the arrival of the card every day because the doc wont prescribe  my medication and the doctor will not give me any or perform epidurals.
His office just called me today to let me know they forgot about me.  How  I have been bed ridden for over a week now and have not eaten in 4 days and I am facing on emergency Room trip after being treated.|If I could have made it zero stars I would have! My husband went to him when his office was still on 447, he was looking for pain relief.  A Cortisone Shot was discussed, and he gave him one so quickly Dr didn't even bother to clean the skin or wipe with alcohol on his wrist.  The shot hit a nerve, I guess that is what happens when your in such a hurry.  On leaving the building Dr Mikhail was having a very vocal hissy fit and yelling at his staff. Very unprofessional, we never went back!!!!!!!!|It is my privilege to write this review on behalf of Dr. Mikhail Artamonov and his staff because almost a decade ago when I became a patient, my life of chronic pain finally changed for the better. I have a pain disorder that was very difficult to diagnose. I had countless exams over my life with a variety of specialists who could not pinpoint my actual disorder. Finally, thanks to Dr. Artamonov and his vast training and in-depth knowledge, I am receiving the care and treatments I never knew existed before becoming his patient. Though my condition is permanent, he attends regular training for the newest technologies available today including participating as a certified physician in the state's Medical Marijuana Program. He and his staff are equipped to perform all the latest diagnostic tests and procedures available in spine and pain management.

From healthcare related issues to scheduling, billing, and every department I have had occasion to communicate with, the staff is extraordinarily professional and makes me feel like a part of a
family. Particularly, Dina Cascioli, Medical Assistant, Cassidy C., Front Desk Receptionist, Amanda B. in the billing department, and Practice Manager, Arifa A., treat me with the dignity and respect every patient deserves.

If I could rate this Harvard-trained specialist any higher than 5 stars, I would. Advance Pain, Spine, and Sport Medicine has been a blessing. This community is extremely fortunate to have Dr. Artamonov and his practice.

I waited in his waiting room over two hours to see him. He felt an intrathecal morphine pump would be good relief for me from my chronic conditions.

My morphine dose had reached an astounding number of over 3.5 mugs every 24 hours. Then he prescribed me a bottle of Percocet.  I left his office.

Lacking any clinical trials to support any of their claims, I decided to treat elsewhere.

Anyone offering stem cell therapy in a town as small as Grove City and in a facility this small without an expensive lab is likely a scam.

First it should have been a big red flag that I had to pay up from for 10 sessions of soft wave therapy! Second when I ask the woman that was doing the soft wave about her only doing it for three minutes she rolled her eyes at me and had a very annoyed look on her face! I was just voicing my concern as I was facing another spinal cord surgery and saying that I was reading that treatment was longer than three minutes!

I finally decided this wasn't the proper place and felt strongly in my heart that I was being scammed! I was forced to pay 1,250 dollars up from, not allowing me to pay per session and they were only doing three minute treatments! I prayed for god to guide me in the right direction as I didn't want to have another spinal cord surgery and I wasn't getting any relief from my terrible pain! My prayers were answered and now I go to the guy the created the soft wave machine and he confirmed my suspicion about being scammed! He does 15 minute treatments which equals 2,200 shocks compared to 3 minute treatments equals 450 shocks! I am finally seeing results!

That being said, he was over 45 minutes late for that appointment and every subsequent appointment thereafter. Once he realized after the car insurance money ran out and I was on Medicaid, his ""bedside"" manner was horrible. He was very short and rude to me. Then they sent me a bill for $2,000 which is illegal to do when someone is on Medicaid. I would not recommend him at all.|Dr. Barry himself is wonderful up until I had a miscommunication with one of his nurses and then everything went down hill, they treated me like I was a drug addict, a liar, and totally irresponsible and I have been upset ever since they sent me to a different pain specialist guess they didn't want to be called out on something they did wrong, his staff is absolutely horrible!!|I have a HUGE review below but do not speak  up for yourself to his staff not even kindly !!! His nurses are rude and I asked that they please treat me with kindness because I wasn't rude to them I expected the same treatment so when other issues came up dr Berry said the surgery center was refusing to let me have my procedure done there because I'm a hard stick (a surgery center?) so I had to have it with a different doctor at the hospital but that doctor said no because he didn't want to do sedation so a friend was having the same thing done with that doctor that next day (I know crazy but true) so she asked him and he said he had no issue with it. Sooo I go back to doctor Berrys nurses and I ask questions I had every right to ask I still wasn't rude one just a few days ago I got a letter saying all advanced pain centers will not see me due to my treatment of the staff!

Please tell me how withholding medication from a dying patient is doing no harm!

Update: My friend switched doctors to someone who trusts her when she says she's in pain and understands what a burden trips to the doctor's office can be, especially unplanned ones.|I liked Dr Berry personally but he wants to do a nerve block on my back i told him I can't do the needles in my back I get really sick and I can't handle it. So he brought up iv sedation but said my insurance won't cover it. So he said he could give me an Ativan well I take klonopin 4 times a day I know Ativan isn't going to work. My husband said after we left the office that if I really wanted the iv sedation he would pay for it. So I called them back for a price. Now im told he can't do iv sedation! I was so excited to try this option and now im back to being sick already cause I do not do well with injections with out sedation. I've had to be sedated for just steroid injection!
Im just very unhappy that I was told it was an option and I got so excited to now it's a no! Why bring it up? Ugh!

Update Dr Berry has decided to do the iv sedation I'm so excited to try this procedure out!

I also changed my starts from 3 to 5 cause I honestly one had it lower because of the sedation situation! Other wise I thought Dr berry was great

Updates so my procedure was cancelled due to me being a hard stick so I've been waiting for an update on that in the mean time I did request dr Berry take over my tramadol but I'll tell you didn't now I've changed my stars from 2 to 5 back to a 2!!! The front seat lady and de Berry are very nice but whoever speaks to you in the emails they are so rude!!! And I'm very very nice it's one of the only things I really give myself credit for in life I have no been mean in anyway even tho I've had a right to be but every time I have interacted with these other ladies they are just nasty!!! Totally unwarranted!!! So I'm done until I am respected I refuse to have any respect! I even understand him not wanting to write my tramadol I said that before I got the rude reply about him not doing it!!! But damn let's get my procedure going!!! I just want to be on the road to less pain that's all I want! So I pray you ladies start having pain! Terrible pain that Motrin or anything else will help so you know what this is like! You honestly deserve it!!!
Just get me my procedure done so I can never speak to your office EVER AGAIN!
Yet even more BS today. Got an email saying dr mills won't do my procedure with sedation dr Berry after agreeing to sedation is now saying he won't do it unless it's Ativan that won't work on me I take klonopin 4 times a day now they are saying the surgery center won't allow my sedation like what??? A surgery center won't do sedation??? This is ridiculous so I've told them just to forget it I'll just be in pain the rest of my life also emails are still not being signed so I'm going to be going above their heads in regards to that because it's definitely not professional at all to not let a patient know who they are dealing with.

The extremely debilitating  worsening long- lasting pain every early morning after resting my head on the pillow for more two hours has recently some what subsided.  I actually woke up with about half the level of pain that I have had in the last  about 6 months.  Hopefully this willl last-we will see?!
I want to thank you Dr  Boyd for your exceptional kindness and precise navigation through the procedure and wise counsel afterwards.  Also I want to thank the attending staff and especially ""Liz"" who was so supportive and compassionate during and after the procedure.  Thanks for  the apple juice and sticking by me ""Liz "" till my dizziness subsided.  Also thank you to KaitIyn who is so wonderful to greet at check in and helpful at checking out, along with friendly and supportive Lisa!!! Dare I forget to thank P.A. Judy H. and Jen G. who encouraged me much to proceed with this nerve block. I felt very cared for all the way through and the results of the Oblation Nerve Block is quite better than expected.  So as always, I highly recommend Pennsylvania Pain and Spine Institute to anyone who wants compassionate caring guidance and relief in the relentless struggle with chronic debilitating pain.|I have been using PA Pain & Spine for pain relief for many years.

I cannot say enough about the care I have received from all the doctors and physicians assistants at the Chalfont office. Dr. Qu was the first doctor I saw many years ago, next was Dr. Bozak. I give these 2 excellent physicians 10 stars. The past year or so I have been seen by Dr. Jeffery Boyd and I cannot express the thanks I give him knowing he saved me from surgery. Dr. Boyd takes the time to listen and explains every step of the injection process during the procedures. Dr. Boyd really makes you feel comfortable, so he gets 10 stars also.  I also want to commend the front desk ladies, always very pleasant.|Dr Boyd is ver attentive, knowledgeable and a very good listener! I am so happy to have met him, despite having another scary flare up coming from my lumbar / pelvic region. He thoroughly explained and showed me the MRI photo area of concern and advised me the recommended option should I have a flare up again. Additionally, he spent more time with me yesterday than a previous Pain Management Dr. that I had 2 appointments with. Also, Dr Boyd probably spent more time with me than the Dr who performed my Lumbar Spinal Fusion & Laminectomy last July 23.|I am very pleased with my care at PP&S Inst.

I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service I received during my recent appointment. The efficiency and proficiency of both you and your staff left a lasting impression on me.

My appointment was scheduled for 9:00 am, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself out the door by 9:30 am. This timeframe included a thorough series of x-rays, which you reviewed with me. Your willingness to address all of my questions and concerns made me feel much more confident about my 12-week recovery from knee surgery.

Thank you for your dedication and expertise. I am grateful to have you as my orthopedic healthcare provider.

I travel 3 hours each way to see him every other month- it's a long haul but totally worth it- I am 35 and he is the only doctor that takes my chronic pain  seriously. He listens unlike so many other practitioners and does not dismiss me because of my age. We always catch up each time I'm in and he is genuinely interested in his patients' lives and ways he can help manage pain. He offers a wide array of options and even does injections right in the office. His staff is lovely as well! I am usually in and out of the office in 45 mins max. Only downside is the phone service, they rarely answer due to being busy and as the voicemail states they get back to you within a day or two. SO if it's a pressing matter you are stuck waiting.

The front office gave her a paper stating they tried calling her but her mailbox was full. She asked why they didn't call back and was told it was computerized and random. They then mailed a letter to her old address and told her it was ""her problem"" the address was not current. Wouldn't let her speak to the Dr. She is 73 years old with mounds of physical issues and to be shut out, without weaning off her meds, which could cause withdrawal is the most scary thing she is facing.

He has a very mild and calming voice during appointments. He was very up to date on new pain medicines. We were recently told (5 weeks ago) and then were subsequently notified by letter (this week) that his practice has closed.|The
Staff is so rude espically the front desk and this doctor does not work with you for pain control.  How dare you ask for certain medication he will label you immediately and say big brother is watching he's so unprofessional.  I found a new doctor that is wonderful and he's controlling my pain not talking to me like I'm and addict.  He is a horrible person I don't know how he's still practicing.|I have seen Dr. Upadhyay for over two years.  He knows how to treat pain.  If you go in and dictate to him what you need, he is not your doctor.  If you're open minded and listen he will find a way and method to resolve your pain issues.  I highly recommend this doctor and his practice.  I also find his staff very accommodating and helpful. The office is now closed. Dr. Upadhyay  I wanted to thank you for treating me the nine years.  You will be in my thoughts and prayers. I hope all is well or everything gets better.|Dr. Upadhyay is the best doctor I see--and I have a handful of them due to multiple health problems. He truly listens. That's not common in doctors. He respects my intelligence and takes me seriously. It's clear that he is up to date with the research and new medications. Because I have other health problems, there are some meds I can't take, and he is careful to prescribe what's safe for me. I've been seeing him for several years and my pain is reduced so much that I have my life back.
Also. Some people may hesitate to go to a doctor with a ""foreign"" name because they're afraid they won't understand him. Dr. Upadhyay has no accent whatsoever, and in fact is a US Army veteran. His name is pronounced ""you-PA-zhah""--it's easy!
I would recommend him to anyone who is suffering in pain. He will do his best for you.|READ ENTIRE REVIEW! Dr. Upadhyay and staff are wonderful.  They work hard to keep your pain at a minimum.  They also work hard to keep you safe from narcotic abuse. Being in pain is hard and you can tell they do everything they can for you. So glad I found them!
Edited: I spoke too soon!  I gave the front office staff my medical marijuana card on my first visit.  I was prescribed narcotics which I took as ordered. I even stopped taking a benzo without a problem in order to treat my pain.  Then I was kicked out of the practice for having marijuana in my system! Watch out for this trap!!!!|Called for 1 month to get an appointment.  When I was finally able to get one I gave my insurance information over the phone and they said it wouldn't be an issue. I get to my appointment and the front desk says, ""What is this?"" The office staff are rude, unprofessional,  and judgmental.  If you want respect treat your patients with respect. Don't act surprised when someone treats you the way you treat them. I have Highmark through my employer and Gateway as a secondary. God forbid you have Gateway. That's poor people insurance.  I would give a BIG ZERO if it was an option.|As a potential new patient I had to reschedule two appointments due to family emergencies. I was given a reschedule date for October, when I called to find out when as I couldn't find the paper I wrote it on, I was told that the Dr. would not be seeing me because I cancelled my first two appointments. Must be great to be so lucky on having the perfect life and family members where there are no EMERGENCIES. What happened to the Hippocratic Oath he took? Seems more like I WANT MONEY OATH.

I had a pain management Dr. for over ten years. I drove 11/2 hours to Lebanon every month. In all those years I rarely had to reschedule and he NEVER had any problems with me. Sadly he retired.|I spent a year seeing Dr.Upadhyay and what I got for my effort is a partially crippled foot because of a Dangerous operation which was caused mostly by an Incompetent Surgeon Dr. Heather Theime.
He told me I had a possible Neuropathy that had to be confirmed by a Biopsy of the foot Sural Nerve. I went to a supposedly good surgeon who turned out to be completely incompetent for this problem and my foot is now damaged after over 7 years running.(9/2016)
I found out through University of PA Neurology that you RARELY use this Biopsy method and always use basic electrical testing (EMG) or NEEDLE BIOPSY to diagnose Neuropathy. This Biopsy typically causes problems regularly and shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary. But just recently I learned it is a excellent way to diagnose Neuropathy but the problem was I didn't get a chance to really discuss the Alternative type of biopsies that were available and how this one could be so bad!
I apologize for the previous review I had making Dr Upadyaha the problem with the outcome of this Biopsy which was 100% caused by the Surgeon.
I woke up screaming after surgery from this procedure and was driven by anger and hate following 6 years of crippling foot pain from a woman who knew nothing of this procedure and blamed the Dr. for the bad outcome when he was only trying to do what he felt was the best possible diagnosis of Neuropathy.",2024-08-16|2024-07-24|2021-07-20|2023-08-02|2020-07-20|2020-10-22|2018-10-15|2019-12-04,3|1|5|5|1|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ_XaiS9yOyIkRUYVFR8pzvi4,25

In that time I've had 5 injections and have seen him multiple times. He is who I trust to help me through some really difficult times. I have 3 herniated/bulging discs at C4, C5 & C6 & 1 more at L5/S1. Before getting the injections & getting medication, I was in debilitating pain. I'm 40 years old and messed my spine up through all my years wrestling. Also, their staff at the location where they do the injections is fantastic. I believe it's his wife who is the Dr who does the injections and she is great. Knowing that I have this place to help me live as pain free as possible has meant the world to me.|The dr accepted me as a patient but refused to get pre authorization for my migraine shot. He is only interested in high dollar pain shots. His staff are great but I would not recommend him unless all you want is pain shots. I have never had a doctor that was only a business man. Thank goodness I was able to get tele med with my old pain management doctor, who actually cares about her patients. I don't think he should be allowed to be in the medical field.|I had a horrible experience! If you don't want high paying narcotics they throw you out the door even if you're paralyzed and on a stretcher needing help. Shame on them!|I was recommended to this practice by my primary. Although they rescheduled my first appointment, I was willing to give it a shot. Long wait time, but who doesn't these days. I really enjoyed the doctor and thought he listened to me. Unfortunately, what should have been a 2-5 day process to get an MRI ordered and approved by insurance took 2 months and counting. The staff members do not return calls and no one took care of their responsibilities to get the proper documentation submitted and I ended up missing my window of insurance to get my MRI completed. Still having debilitating back pain with no results or answers, in addition to no returned phone call.|I felt confidence in the doctor but no confidence in his staff. No one answered the phone no one returned my phone calls no one told me that they did not take my insurance they left me hanging waiting for an injection in pain and never mention to me that they did not take my insurance how can you have confidence in a doctor that does not have a good staff does not look well for them|Yesterday I had back injections done at this location. The staff including the doctors, as well as the Nurse Robin, were so kind and helpful in assisting me with making sure my procedure went smoothly. They displayed the utmost professionalism, and made this whole experience, a relief.

I highly recommend them, and will continue to do so! Thank you!|Dr Sanjay Midnani is very helpful and understanding! As far as office staff: the phone is rarely answered, VM box is ALWAYS full and nobody is ever available to take a call. Very frustrating. Day 3 I am waiting for my prescription to be sent to my pharmacy although they have told me it was done twice.|The pain doctors, Dr. Sanjay and Anju Madnani are absolutely phenomenal ! Dr Anju is compassionate, thorough and explains everything before , during and after the pain injection.

I then ask him if he would like to speak with the orthopedic spine doctor who took the imaging and gave me the diagnosis and to take a look at the disc of my x-rays, cat scan and mri and he tells me no that he knows whats wrong already without even examining me. The ladies who work here are very nice, but that's about it. Id rather pay hundreds out of pocket then to go here again.|I had been going to Dr. Moin Mallhi for quite a few years. Last year in January I was in a head on car accident and my car insurance policy covered $5,000 for my medical expenses. Because I had a brain tumor removed 3 years ago as well as had a back surgery 30 years ago I had to go to the ER for a CAT SCAN of my brain immediately after the accident and then that following week had to go for an MRI of my back. I was told by my PCP to go to a chiropractor for my pain. I began seeing a chiropractor 3 times a week and was in quite a bit of pain. I decided not to get Dr. Moin involved during that time due to being worried that my insurance would go over the $5,000 and I would then be responsible for paying him should that happen. Finally I started to see Dr. Moin Mallhi again once I stopped seeing the chiropractor. However he stopped prescribing one of my medications and because he prescribed so many medications I did not immediately notice. Once I noticed I called the office and spoke to Deidre and told her to ask him why. She kept telling me that I had not gotten that medication since January and that I should have asked him when I saw him in the office. After I had seen him the first couple of times in the office they started doing phone appointments due to COVID and when I'd ask then I never could get an answer either. Whenever I called and spoke to Deidre she would get really snappy at me and treat me as though I was a drug addict or something. This medications was Xanax of which I was prescribed to take twice a day but I only would take 1 a day if I didn't need 2 so I had enough left to take them on a daily basis up until a few months prior to questions of her the reason why! All I wanted was a reason because all of the other meds he prescribed for me were still being refilled. When I spoke to her and she could never get me an answer I became emphatic and spoke to her emphatically she accused me of yelling and screaming at her and told the doctor that I was being disrespectful to her. So no sooner does this happen and I get a letter in the mail from the office saying I've been discharged as a patient and I had mentioned to her that doctors should not cut people off completely from that type of medication because they'll have withdrawl symptoms. So in the letter it states that I was given a one month supply of my medications to taper off but I wasn't. I'm going to report this Dr. because patients shouldn't be treated this way! I had called that office for months in a row seeking an answer and never got one. It was right before Christmas and my mom had passed away last year and I was ready for a nervous break down and I just needed the medication even temporarily to get me through those holidays. I was crying my eyes out day after day not knowing which way to turn and I think part of it was the withdrawals from the medication on top of my deep depression. Pain management doctors should not treat people this way he's got plenty of patients going there because he takes Medicaid so I guess I'm just another number that he could throw in his garbage can. The other thing is he pushes for shots shots shots in your back and the shots don't even help the pain but he gets paid more money for giving them so he try's to talk everyone into getting shots. He could have at least gave me a valid reason! And the girls who work for him need to learn to be professional! This Deidre is very cocky and shows absolutely no empathy for people in pain! She practically insinuated that I must have been getting them off the streets because I didn't question it sooner! I told her I would never buy drugs off the street and if I had a dealer why would I be calling her! As a receptionist she shouldn't even be talking to me about my private health record!!! This place is really screwed up! Stay away!|It took 2 hrs after my appt time to be seen. Then the doctor came in, said he wouldn't give me medication but would do nerve blocks (Inn a series up entire side of my back. Never asked to look at previous MRI's, CT scans or Xrays. When I asked if he needed notes from my previous doctors he said no its not needed. He did tell me that both of my back surgeries that were done were not necessary. I said so ur telling me that Dr Joseph Maroon (the Pittsburgh Steelers Neauro surgeon) did a back surgery PRO BONO that was not needed and he told me if i did not do the surgery I would not be walking within a year. And then the doctor in Vegas who did my fusion also did the fusion PRO BONO did it for no good reason? When the insurance I had then only covered the hospital facilities? Yeah I don't think so.

With that said, before going here, like most people I read their reviews and read a lot of negative reviews about everyone from the staff, nurses and Dr. M. And me personally, I don't get it, since the day/minute I walked through their doors I've been met with kindness, Professionalism and respect. I realize that everyone's situation is different. Now I have a TON of issues that cause me insurmountable pain from 13 surgeries, most of which have been spinal surgeries including 2 to 3 failed fusions. My average pain levels are between 8-12 ( I know 10 is max, just making my point )

EVERYONE from the ladies at the front desk, scheduling, surgery center check in to the nurses in the back, especially Cory who took time out of her very busy day to talk to me in depth about one of my issues that are new which she was very Knowledgeable about, I am more grateful to her than she knows ( until now )

As far as the NP's, the 1st one I met was incredibly helpful, took the time to talk to me at length, went over my MRI's with me and discussed my concerns and options. Although she is no longer there my new one is just as nice, Knowledgeable who took the time to collaborate with me. I loved that neither of them have been in a rush. Keep in mind that, like I said, I have a TON of very, VERY painful problems which unfortunately have ruined my life and will interfere with my everyday activities ( I can barely take out the garbage and if I do I pretty much suffer for days )

In the grand old saying goes, I'm saving the best for last. In reference to Dr. M is concerned in my experience with him has been nothing but positive every time I've seen and talked to him. In the past every time I've needed injections the doctors I've seen preferred to put their patients under anesthesia so I was obviously a little bit apprehensive getting them without it, From the VERY MOMENT walk into the surgical room he makes me feel comfortable and has been personable, not in a rush and explained everything he was doing as he was doing it, he has a different approach to the infections than the others which, in my opinion works BETTER than all of the others. Now I've read too many negative reviews about his personality but every time we speak it's been nothing but positive both professionally and personally,

All I can say is that I'm glad I decided to go with them/him than the other places which are closer to home, the extra long drive is definitely worth it. People need to understand that in order to get respect you have to give respect. I would definitely recommend them/him to anyone who needs help as I know just as much as anyone what it's like to live in CONSTANT, horrible pain that leaves me in a fetal position a lot of the time, especially after any kind of activities.

This is an HONEST opinion because trust me, if I was unsatisfied with them/him or had any complaints I would let everyone know, I just don't have any.|They are serious with there rule about there meds like every other place i being here for the last at least minimum 6 years and they are not perfect but they try there's best  for me. ,, or in other case  there patients cause my Doctor she always ready to cooperate with me in a fare way always respecting the rules and professionalism..

If you  guys add a anesthesiology Team  will be the best in the valley small procedure when you are awake they feel painful. Imagine free of that discomfort,  and painful needle, we be niceeeee..
Just something to think..

Thanks you Team Valley Pain Specialist|It is my patient right to meet and discuss issues with my treating physician, yet staff gave me a flat out ""No."" when I asked to meet with the physician. Absolutely horrible office staff with VERY cocky attitude. 3 injections and $145 dollars later and I'm still in the same pain as when started. I should be able to inquire with my doctor, yet staff refuses to schedule me with him, saying they dont do that. They only schedule with PA. Changing to LVPG Pain.|Dr. M. is the absolute best. He saved me. I have been going to him for many years and would not go anywhere else. He is so knowledgeable on pain management and he and his team have always had my best interest at heart. Thank you  Dawn DeRemer|I called today and the lady was beyond rude. I have a referral that was sent in for another pain clinic, and it's been 2 weeks and still nothing so doctor asked me to call them. She was very short with me, had attitude, and hung up phone loudly. I just want to be seen and even they want all this stuff that I don't have. I guess I'll keep waiting, as even from the reviews and now my phone call they were absolutely rude.|So glad I read the reviews before scheduling. The reviews of this office have confirmed exactly what I have been trying to avoid with regard to my pain management. This place sounds bad- I know I can't speak from personal experience for this care team but as someone who struggles with a chronic life shortening illness and a lot of pain- I have seen my fair share of doctors and providers in my life and pain is nearly always an insanely touchy subject, when it does not have to be. No one should have to suffer or feel like an addict/crazy for asking to receive certain treatments or medications. Self advocacy is incredibly important. Don't settle , don't give up !|I went to valley pain specialists about 3 weeks ago it was a consultation and the thing was I didn't have my MRI because my doctor spoke to him over the phone I thought everything was set so he says I can't write any pain meds until I see an MRI and go over the disc and so I got it just 2 days ago they called me up and said come up everything's taken care of we got your results I go there this morning guess what it's not there they can't see me they told me I should stay on Suboxone I said the Suboxone makes me jittery and it doesn't do much for the pain she said okay when you come in next week we'll discuss that but once I have the disc in my hand so everything they say it's not true they back step a lot and they got me going crazy I'm done very arrogant doctor and they have no organization|I've been going to Valley pain specialist a little over a year and very comfortable with my doctor that I could communicate with effectively.

They don't do anything to help her. They just keep giving her injections that don't work or that end up, causing her pain that she has to go to the hospital to get her pain managed.
It's absolutely ridiculous and there is no reason why every single time she has to sit. Her last appointment was at 11:50. She was there at 11:35 was made to sit there until 1:15 She finally has had enough and she will no longer go there she'd rather go to Tower health Pain Management or Comprehensive Pain Management
In my opinion, giving them one star is too much there should be an option to give zero stars|My drs there are amazing!! Dr Brian Lockheart is awsome he saved me from constant pain I can't thank him enough!|I don't feel as if Dr listens to you. And office smells bad like a bunch of cats are walking around.|On my first consultation visit with Dr Eric Ratner, the waiting room was packed (during COVID-19) and I waited almost 2 hours to see him. I was on time for my appointment. I figured there must have been something odd happening to cause such a delay.      On the day of my surgery procedure, he was running 1.5 hours behind.   When I was finally wheeled into the OR, I found him on his phone playing on social media.   Then he continued to delay my procedure while chatting with the staff in the OR for another 5 minutes.    Two weeks later I go to his office for my follow up appointment & again I showed up on time.     The waiting room was packed again, I checked in, & paid my co-pay.  I was then informed that Dr. Ratner was not there, they had no idea when he would be in,  there were 3 people waiting ahead of me, & I was told he was always late.     This explains the long wait for my first visit and the day of my procedure.          I refused to see him, cancelled my appointment, and get my copay refunded.        The level of unprofessionalism and blatant lack of consideration for his patients is inexcusable.    I have never experienced this kind of behavior with a medical professional in my life.  I will not tolerate it and you should not either.   There is nothing Dr Ratner did for me that any other pain management doctor could not do.   I hope you find this review helpful in your decision for choosing against seeing Dr. Eric Ratner .|Regarding Dr. Eric Ratner only: Blatant disregard for other people's time. I was on time; he was NOT EVEN IN THE BUILDING. Not a little late, either--sauntered into the office 55 minutes after my appointment time (numerous people were scheduled before me, also waiting). Literally watched him park his car and walk in the building, his food order in hand. Props to the husband of another patient who was waiting in the parking lot. He called Dr. Ratner out on his lateness. No apology or acknowledgment of 1.5 hour wait time once I finally saw him. Staff was trying to make up for his behavior by processing people as quickly as possible. Flagrant disrespect for his patients.|I have been a patient of Dr. Ratner for years. He is the most caring and compassionate Doctor I have ever met!!! I trust him completely and although sometimes the wait to see him is longer at times for me it just shows that he listens to his patients and makes sure every question and concern is answered.|We absolutely love Dr Ratner. He helped me out for many years and now it is my husbands turn. Only the best for us|Dr. Eric Ratner is in my opinion the best that ever did this. His professionalism coupled with his down to earth, friendly pre-op manner is unmatched by any other specialist that I ever saw.

He does not listen to his patients. I moved to Pittsburgh for a job and had my records transferred from my old clinic in another state. During my first appointment he called me a liar because he did not click in the right place in the Prescription Monitoring Database. I did not want to agree to his treatment plan but felt my hands were tied so I said I would try it. My life has become a living hell. I am afraid I am going to lose my job because most days I can barely get out of bed. I told him all of this during a follow up visit and he couldn't have been less interested. Doctors take an oath to ""do no harm"" yet that is exactly what he has done to my body and my life. I have already contacted my insurance company to file a grievance, plan to contact CMS to file a complaint and am contacting a lawyer. Do NOT go to this doctor, he has harmed me in ways that have left me wanting to die.
If any other patients would like to join together to file a lawsuit against him, please reach out to me. I refuse to be treated this way. I had been on the same regimen for years and he did not care. He needs to lose his medical license, and I am going to make sure that happens.|I've been a patient at this facility now for about 15 years - If I were to rate this facility 1-2 yrs ago, I would have rated them 5stars, however, over the last 7/8 months- the overall service has severely deteriorated.

Recently the fellows that come in prior to the dr are no longer even cordial. In the past I valued my doctor, I believed he was genuinely concerned, he has always been patient, kind, and caring.

It started before I even entered the office, the call to schedule based on the referral was exactly as you could hope it would be.

When I arrived I was met by Kay, I don't want to minimize how wonderful the entire team was as they were all great but Kay was amazing! She was kind, compassionate and friendly. She has the perfect personality for working in an area where people are hurting and I cannot say enough nice things about her.

The rest of my appointment went well and I was happy with how I was treated by the entire staff I came into contact with.

I will say, I was not taken back exactly on time, but I also didn't feel rushed during my appointment, I felt listened to. While of course we all wish everything ran like clock work, I will take a delay in being seen knowing that it is because the staff is listening to others the same way they will be listening to me once they arrive in my room and that is not something you can consistently schedule accurately for.

He simply blew me off and said come back when you are ready for an epidural. This guy had zero bedside manner and exhibited no concern for my issues.

My physician was an hour and a half late, and they checked on me to make sure I was okay.

The doctor, on the other hand, a Dr. Momin, was an absolute horror. After coming in to the room, calling me the wrong name and not acknowledging his lateness, he began asking me the usual questions. Speaking to me, of course, as if I were three years old. After making my condition seem a mere side note, not really that important, I began to cry. Nothing quite brings the tears out like being degraded about something you can't control. Ignoring my crying, the physician continues talking at me, making sure to add the quip, ""I hope you're listening to me"".

Theresa, Office Manager and the entire staff are always friendly, helpful and personable!  It means a lot to me when you go into an office and see the staff with a smile on their face!  THANK YOU, Dr. Lorenzo and staff!!!|I would NOT recommend this office if you have been taking pain medication for a long time and want him to continue them. I was taking them for a long time and I had had surgery a few months ago , I had left over pain mediation . My family Dr. Retired , and I had no more pain medication so I took my old meds.  He told me it was illegal and I am not to take them and would not prescribe me anything.  It was MY OWN medication.  Then said I have to have clean urine when I came back in two weeks for my 2nd visit.  I told him it won't happen bc I'm not going without meds for my back.  I'll be in bed and not be able to move. I will continue to take my own meds.  He refused to see me bc of that.  He is awful and shouldn't be practicing.|I do not understand the negative reviews. I went to Dr. Lorenzo as a last ditch effort. I had completely given up and I had no faith that he could help me. But he gave me my life back. He has done procedures and prescribed medication that make life worth living again after over twenty years of pain. It's not perfect, but it is an improvement that allowed me to go back to work and find joy in life. He is kind, compassionate, gentle, respectful and reasonable. He always has a solution for every problem. He never once even came close to raising his voice to me. The girls in the office are also wonderful. Yes, the office gets busy and it is sometimes hard to communicate, but that happens everywhere, and you just have to be patient and respectful. This office has truly been a life saver for me. Thank you guys for taking such good care of me!|After being told my math doesn't add up, a 90 day x 2 or every eight hours 73 days later I was told I still had two days left. I was not able to come up with two days and told to go home. That was my help with pain management.|I do not understand all the negative reviews. I have been going here now for a year and my mom was going for 2 years I think. They both have taken the time to listen and help. I have had several injections in my cervical and lumbar, both have had nerves burned as well. I was nervous but they made me feel relaxed and I trust them with all my being. My pain will never go away but any relief will help to a little more quality of life so I can spend time with my kids. I have not had any problems with urine tests, getting tests done or with my medications. I appreciate all they have done and are doing to try to help me, the staff has always been very pleasant too. Im sure it helps that even though I am in so much pain I also try to be calm, pleasant and patient with them as well. I take time to listen to them as well, im sure that helps make their day easier. When I go for my procedures Dr L is always kind, joking and calm with me. As for me I feel he is better then any drs I had seen for my pain prior to them and I really dont want to see any other again. Thank you for your service!! Keep up the good work!!|I had been a patient of Dr. Lorenzo for approx. one year and completely agree with Charlotte Haines' previous review. I had had a series of injections for chronic back pain. When Dr. Lorenzo exhausted, what he felt to be, the extent of his treatments with only minor improvement that was short lived, he was professional and honest when he suggested that I be evaluated by another doctor. The status of my spinal problems was (and is) varied and complicated. Details of same will not serve a purpose in this review since the reason for the review is to emphasize the professionalism, caring, courtesy and knowledge were THE BEST OF ALL OTHER DOCTORS  I had seen for the past several years.  He took the time and effort to study all previous test results & possible treatment options in detail, in my presence. I never once found him (or his staff)to be rude, discourteous, uncaring and certainly never heard him ""yell"" or ""scream"".  Now, after I completely recover from a laminectomy and 5 fusions, I am planning to go back to Dr. Lorenzo.  I do not have false expections of being pain free but I have confidence that he will get me another step closer with periodic, targeted injections as suggested by my surgeon.|I read a review on here that's almost the exact issue I had, so it really makes me angry and upset. I've been on an opioid since 2015. I'm a registered nurse with chronic back and neck issues, and fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed with cancer a few months after starting the opioid, and chemo made everything so much worse. I'm cancer free, but I never got back to my baseline in regards to pain. My family physician then decided to farm me out to the pain clinic because he now doesn't manage opioids...sound familiar?
Dr. Lorenzo did nerve blocks to both sides of my lumbar spine...I felt no different after it was done at all. I then ended up in Kristi's care to manage the pain medication. I was first on Percocet, but after a couple years of taking it, I found it to be ineffective about an hour or 2 after taking it, if at all. She berated me because I had taken my last Percocet the night before my appt, so it wasn't in my system, like I was some addict or was selling it on the street. I had to request going on a long acting pain med instead so I don't have the issue of it not lasting, which she agreed. I really don't understand why it wasn't suggested by her to begin with...there's less of a chance of abuse for patients and it's continuous coverage, but I'm not a pain ""specialist""...
So, I've been on the lowest dose of morphine ER since then. It works well enough for me to function...of course it doesn't take the pain away completely, but it's more tolerable. Several months ago, I thought I'd try CBD oil to see if I got any relief from that too, or if it would at least help me sleep at night. I discussed it with Kristi and she was fine with it. She had even stated that if I came up positive on a urine, then we'll know why and it's already documented. There are so many different CBD products out there, so I tried one and my drug screen was negative, but it really didn't seem to help at all. I thought I'd try a different product, and although it really didn't do anything for pain, it really helped with sleep (and anxiety), so I used it for almost 3 months (my tests were random and one month fell during vacation). That's when the issues started with the drug screens. I came up with a very low positive on my drug screen on Oct 1. She told me I couldn't use the CBD anymore, so I stopped it, but I was still positive Oct. 31. She basically accused me of ""doing street drugs"", and stated she would have to discharge me if I came up positive again. I had no answers for her. I don't doubt the first positive possibly from the CBD oil- that was a mistake to try, but I  have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that has ANY potential risk for me to come up positive again for THC, and I'm talking a really conscious effort! In no way would I risk losing the one med that keeps me functional, but she told me I had a really low positive again at the next visit, and I actually demanded to see the results, which she was completely rude and condescending about. She discharged me with nothing but the 5 days of morphine ER I had left, and then tells me to wean off of it, and I shouldn't have a problem...really?!!!
I saw at least one other review like this, and it makes me wonder. On one of those visits, there were THREE other urine specimens in the little cubby when I put mine in it that day (I frequently find at least one in there, but 3?! Oh, and the waiting room was completely empty, so I can imagine how long they were there). Doesn't that allow the chance of someone tampering or switching something, or even employee error? What I CAN say is that I have never felt more like a dreg of society.
UPDATE: I switched to HMC's family practice just after this in Jan. They felt I was misdiagnosed (and how was I given a dx. of spinal spondylosis without  diagnostics? My back was fine, and my drug test was completely clean! I have an autoimmune disorder of some type (tbd), so I started Methotrexate...what a difference! I'm on Methadone 2.5mg twice daily instead of the Morphine ER 15 mg and it's the best I've been since even before cancer!|I can not understand the negative reviews. He is the BEST when it comes to problem solving and unlike other pain management Doctors, he doesn't say, there is nothing more I can do like the others I've seen. He keeps trying to problem solve!! I won't go anywhere else and I live at least 45 minutes from his office, instead of those nearer to my home in Lancaster.
I forgot to address the comments towards Dr. Lorenzo's attitude...OMG.. MEAN?!! REALLY?!! This man is soft spoken caring and has a very kind bedside manner, meaning all my visits, he is nothing but I described anove!!",2024-08-06|2024-09-13|2023-11-06|2024-07-24|2019-03-04|2018-08-10|2020-01-24|2018-07-27,5|2|5|2|5|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|multiple_locations|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJA2l6Pi0dxokR05mhblmPY3U,31

He recommended intracept procedure, yet I was told by 2 ortho surgeons and another pain mgmt doctor that I did not have Modic changes so this procedure would not benefit me. He refused other procedures recommended by my very experienced ortho surgeon. I would avoid this place if you are not stuck here by Workers Comp.|If 0 stars was an option that is the rating I would give this place. I called to schedule an EMG and was scheduled, I filled all the paperwork. When I arrived I was told there was no way I could have been scheduled for an EMG as the doctor who does them left over a year ago. They thought my appointment was to refer me to get an EMG. Which is baffling given that my primary doctor sent them a referral to do the EMG which is the whole reason I scheduled the test with them. There was no empathy or acknowledgement of inconvenience towards me for wasting time from work and traveling there for literally nothing! I am not known for leaving negative reviews but this horrendous experience cannot go silent and if you are trying to schedule an EMG I'll save you time. Go anywhere else but here.|I had been seeing Dr. Fishman for >1 yr w/no complaints. I've had 7 spinal surgeries that have left me with chronic mod-severe pain. We were waiting on my SSDI application result & the plan was for me to remain on Oxycodone until SSDI was approved, & then I could on Medicare & get a pain pump inserted.
However, I became depressed/felt hopeless b/c my pain was worsening.& I told my husband I was going to OD on Tylenol, which caused an overnight stay at LGH's behavioral dept located in the ER. I saw a Psychiatristt the next morning & he cleared me for D/C.

I went to my next pain mngmt appt & saw Dr Matz who abruptly D/C'd my pain med & anxiety med that I had been taking for about 2 yrs w/o putting me on anything for withdrawal (b/c of my suicidal ideations). And,  yep-I went into withdrawal-I was so bad that I truly couldn't get out of my house, so I called my PCP & we had a video visit; my PCP gave me something for the withdrawal-I knew better than try to call the pain mngmt doctors b/c they seemed like they didn't care at all.

ALL of my UDS's always came back negative for substances, & I have NEVER been a drug seeker. Now, because they took me off of my pain meds (Dr Kim & Dr Matz were both very dismissive-acted like they didn't even want to talk to me, & offered no other treatment of any kind, like Iovera, trigger point injections, RFA's, etc),  my pain has ramped up SOOO much!!! I sit in my recliner, reclined all the way back 24/7. I can barely get around.

It's impossible to reach the Lancaster office staff directly-their phone system is absolutely convoluted. I left a message 2 wks ago at the main switchboard b/c I need to know if they are still planning on inserting a pain pump or not if my SSDI Appeal gets approved. I STILL haven't heard from anyone. I need an SSDI recommendation letter from them, but why bother calling. They obviously don't want to be bothered with me. I could always count on Dr. Fishman...but he left their practice. IF they DO bother contacting me (which I highly doubt), I may amend this review.

I just wonder if they would treat their mothers or sisters like that.

Poor care after Dr. Fishman left, & poor follow-up.|I can't say enough about this office...I've been suffering with pain (full neck fusion, Bi-lateral Shoulder replacement (twice), lower back, my list goes on). Have done everything from pain meds to physical therapy, nothing was working...until I was told about a pain pump (from Dr Marotti across the hall). I had that put in, in 2019,!my life has changed. I was able to go back to work (PT) and got a lil chunk of my life back. I appreciate Dr Kim (I've seen Fishman & Vanetessi), he's a very patient and understanding Dr, he explains everything and has a wonderful bedside manner, which means a great deal to me. He now has a nurse come to my home to fill my pump, so I no longer need to go to the office for this procedure. As for getting ahold of anyone on the phone, I never have any problem...it just takes a little time, which requires a little patience!!|Was having a wonderful experience with Dr. Fishman, until he left recently. He was kind and he took the time to listen and understand; I am so upset over his departure, as I felt I had finally found a great doctor. I was switched to Dr. Kim and so far it has been a nightmare and traumatizing. Getting a hold of office personal is impossible. Not sure what to do at this point because I can't get any answers as far as if any of the other docs at the Lancaster office deals with pumps. I know Dr. Polin does not, I'm not sure about Dr. Vanetesse.|Would have given a lower rating were it not for the amazing staff at the office. Dr. Fishman is awesome. The staff is very respectful and polite.

However, their call center service has got to go. The good people at the office cannot account for the behavior and lack of professionalism found in the call center that is used, instead of contacting an actual person at the office.

This becomes increasingly important in cases like mine, where a lackadaisical call center employee with he attitude, creates an issues that sent me into withdrawal for three days.

Patients should have direct access to their doctors.

Sincerely,
George.|Love Dr. Vanetesse
Love the staff
Very helpful very caring....
But the phone situation is the worst !!!!!!!!!!I cannot get a hold of a human for anythIng in the world. Wait wait wait only to speak to someone who says there not sure they are not in states they are all based over seas and she is from Costa Rica. All she can do is send them a message and then she just hangs up on me  Had a few times for this. i literally cannot handle the stress just trying to get a hold of my Doctors office for days at a time. Literally sitting here crying i feel so lost . What do I do. to speak to a human AT MY DR OFFICE!!!!|Dr Tony Vanatesse has helped me manage my pain in more areas then I thought possible.

My husband's pain physician wanted him to get steroid knee injections and recommended he come here for that. I thought it was rather odd because steroid injections can be done very easily in a PCP office or in an orthopedic office.  Anyway, we had the unfortunate experience of coming to this joint.  Appt was at 10am and we were finally seen at 10:50. They would not let his wife come back (maybe I know too much?
The medical assistant tells him that the reason for visit today was to test which nerves in lumbar area of back would be marked for burning.  He questioned why that was planned because his pain doctor said specifically it would be knee injections she said well, I guess we are done then.  We would never agree to this method of treatment. All i can say is run, not walk from this hell hole and never look back. If you are not an educated person and know what is going on you may suffer some serious damage|Waiting an hour and a half for the doctor with no one telling you anything is unacceptable!  If any of them went to a restaurant and had to wait for their reservation they would be furious.  As the staff sit and knit a sweater is again unacceptable.  No regard for the people at the pain clinic sitting in pain for an hour after appointment time.  Should have been called to say the doctor was running late.  But if we show up late. They will not see you and bill you.  Wexford is the worst Cade Kessler is the office manager. He was not in.|Look, I will never claim anyone is perfect and there is no business that is either, but I question a lot of these negative reviews. I have been a patient at the Wexford office for years and I have never have had much of a problem. Occasionally there is a long wait that is uncalled for, but that isn't often. I have had a lot of procedures done here from a steroid injection to a rhizotomy and they have always been professional about it. If anyone has ever had problems with Lauren then I hate to say this but you had to have been rude yourself because she is nothing but professional, informative and kind. I have had issues with one PA there and made it known and now they refrain from scheduling me with him. The rest of the PAs have been incredible. Calling in can be an issue and scheduling can be rough sometimes, but all in all they have taken good care of me and I cannot complain about my care here. You have the ability to go somewhere else if you are not happy, that is what makes this country great.|West Mifflin location- From beginning to end of the appointments, you are treated with courtesy and respect from the front office staff.

Dr. Mitros and the PAs are extremely thorough with giving initial exams, then explains at length what the treatment plan will be moving forward.

He listens very well and cares about the needs of the patient. He will also take your input and recommendations into consideration before making any decisions. I can honestly say out of all the pain doctors I've seen in the last 20 years, he is the most patient and caring of them all and did not rush me during our visit.

Unlike other reviews i have read, they do no push procedures. Most people do not understand that procedures are beneficial and long lasting in most cases. it is the obligation of the staff to recommend something like that prior to more invasive techniques.

I am thrilled i found him because i know he will put my needs first|I like the doctors that being said the only person ever to rub me wrong who was rude and treated me like I wanted drugs was Jason F. , Even though the reason I found APM was to get off medicine.
The other issue is when making my appointments I only get to see a P.A. (even though they are nice and knowledgeable) when going to the office I saw a doctor 4 times in 18 months unless getting a procedure.
I can't say anyone was rude ever except Jason and I told the doctor and never had to see him since. It isn't unusual to wait for specialist but honestly if just seeing a P.A. I understand why so many on here have issues with that. In my opinion the results are worth it.|HORRIBLE experience with steroid injection appt. I was told to arrive 30 min before my 2:15 appt today. I walked in to a waiting rm and no receptionist (just a trainee who told me to wait) and waited 5 min. Check in was relatively easy...then the wait. They took 2 people before me and when I asked them at 2:35 (20 min after my appt time) what the estimated time would be to wait, I was told conflicting things. The receptionist then told the trainee to take me back...the hallway and rooms were disgusting.  Dirt everywhere, the ""new"" pillow case had more dried stains on it than a hotel mattress, and medical equipment (BP cuff, pulse ox) of lesser quality that what I have at home from Amazon. I waited over 5 minutes and heard from the hall that there was still a patient ahead of me, so I asked to be removed from the schedule to leave. I was then told I ""came in at the wrong time"" (despite my showing my appoint card that THEY mailed me with the time I arrived on it) and that I had to wait another HOUR in the dirty room for the possibility of a steroid injection. I wasn't even there for pain meds. The only provider (a PA named Lauren, not an MD) in the office came out and argued with me and was extremely rude, as was the receptionist. They blamed ""scheduling"" for the error even though it was the receptionist (Jill) who had called me to schedule my appt. I then asked for a co-pay refund and they charged me a SECOND TIME, giving me a receipt stating they charged my card. I will be marking it as fraud with my bank. But fair warning....this is a horrible, unprofessional office.|As another reviewer noted, I'd also give zero stars if that were an option. This may very well be the worst medical facility I've ever been to, from the insane wait times to the rude staff to the frankly unqualified physicians assistants. Some quick background - I have compression fractures of my T7 and T12 vertebrae from an accident about 9 months ago.  I waited over two hours to be seen today, in extreme pain the entire time I was in the waiting room.  Once I was eventually seen, it was only by a nurse and then by an extremely smug and incompetent physicians assistant, upon which time I was thoroughly treated like a drug addict because I am a medical cannabis patient here in PA.  So let this cautionary tale be a warning to any other MMJ patients who may need supplemental pain management:  Do not come here, as they don't think of you as a real person in severe pain.  Save your time, sanity, dignity, and money, and find a better clinic.|I just want to say that Meredith and the doctors have changed my life, they gave me a chance when nobody else would. I was in so much pain before I started seeing Meredith, Dr Mitros , Dr Hibbard and Dr Lodico and everyone have been nothing but excellent and caring the entire process. I feel so much better and owe them a lifetime of gratitude for everything they have done for me. They listen to all my corncerns and have ordered all the appropriate tests.

He takes his time with each patient and listens to them and their issues. He will order tests before he recommends any type of relief. Since he does take his time on many occasions you will wait 2-3 hours for your turn!!! On a few, I mean a few, times there was no one in the waiting room and we did not have to wait. Yeay!!! But, I will always wait. I recommend Dr Rosenthal to a lot of people. He is thoughtful, compassionate, gentle, professional and I feel the best. And the surgery center where I go, oh, everyone is wonderful.|SCOTT ROSENTHAL IS FANTASTIC. LISTENS AND KNOWS HIS JOB.

I came in for a procedure on my ear from the front desk team to the clinical staff who checks you in and evaluates you is absolutely horrible. The anesthesiologist Dr. Pope or Poe it was, whatever his name is was terrible. He came in and I told him how I was scared of needles and if he could lay me back before proceding, he ignored me, looked at the other nurse that checked me in who was named Tom and ROLLED HIS EYES at me & didnt lay me back. The nurse Tom laughed and smirked at him about me being nervous. Then, Dr. Pope walked out and said nothing. I started crying and nobody checked in on me. Absolutely DISGUSTING. If you cant be compassionate about people in the medical field you should not work in that field. PERIOD. Walked by me several times and just gave me dirty looks. Then, I complained to the other nurse who was going to take me back and all they said was ""we will look into it"" yeah sure okay. Then, after my procedure, i remember waking up and feeling very dizzy, the girl nurse next to me just stared at me & I said i dont feel good, i feel very dizzy. She didnt help me whatsoever & said ""yeah, well thats from the anesthesia."" No human compassion from anybody. & all that will happen is some robot commenting on this and just saying the same response they said to every negative review on here, nobody cares. They will get away with this behavior and its disgusting. Will never come back here and no one else should. Trust me.|I see a lot of negative reviews about this hospital but I had surgery ant this facility yesterday and I had an excellent experience. From the intake to the pre-op and recovery nurses, to my surgeon Dr. Hwa and her OR staff, everyone treated me with the highest respect and utmost care and compassion. I would highly recommend Dr. Hwa and the team at Penn Medicine Tuttleman Center to anyone looking for quality care.|If you're looking for a place where your needs are not genuinely cared for and multiple individuals handle your case without proper communication, then THIS is the place. I met with Dr. Ashburn, who barely spent 5 minutes discussing a procedure with me, failing to mention he wouldn't be performing it himself. To make matters worse, I met the performing MD on the day of the procedure, which was a new experience for me and a terrible introduction to a new physician.

After the initial visit, I was instructed to schedule a follow-up appointment for the injection three weeks later. However, when I called, the earliest available slot was six weeks away. Two weeks into the wait, I began experiencing intense pain and sought an earlier appointment. Unfortunately, my concerns were dismissed by someone other than a nurse, who suggested seeing a different provider (PA) for a quicker appointment. Reluctant to switch providers when the ordering and performing MD barely knew me, I felt ignored as my complaints of pain were brushed aside in favor of rescheduling to whoever was available.

In a further attempt to address my symptoms, I messaged again, requesting the MD to be informed. However, I received a dismissive response from the PA, solely focusing on scheduling without addressing my swelling or pain management concerns. Ending it with a real loving ""I hope you feel better soon.""

When I called the office again, the receptionist assumed my call was about scheduling. I clarified that my main concern was the lack of communication with the MD, as messages were being handled by someone named Carol, who didn't seem to be part of the clinical team and wasn't relaying my concerns to the MD.

I'm sharing this experience to warn others about a facility that neglects patient complaints and complications arising from procedures they've performed.|It would have been one star if it wasn't for the Resident, Aaron, he was so knowledgeable and kind! I appreciated his care. When the attending physician came in everything just felt different. Her demeanor, the whole vibe/scene just changed!! She definitely could've stayed where she was at and tried it another day.  im gonna rock with em for now see how it goes|Not sure if this is even the right place because there are multiple practices operating out of the same building. today 12/11/23 my fiance had a surgery scheduled for a cochlear implant. Before I continue this hospital system has on multiple occasions with held surgery/implant/symptoms and so on for this surgery. So today we arrive ( myself my fiance and 3 going to be 4 year old son) and am instantly greeted with hostility when entering the building by your so called security guards. That honestly if something was to actually happen here could not physically do anything to stop. Then am told by then that me and my son could not wait in the waiting room because he's under 4 (his birthday is Feb 2nd). And am told that she ( my fiance) has to do this check in and everything by herself. Mind you she is there for a cochlear implant surgery and can not hear nor understand people talking to her. We were told to arrive at 115. Then told the surgery does not start until 230 it is now 334 pm on the same Day and the surgery has not just started. I never received a text about the patient which I am connected to via the patient texting app. Further more was with held information by her doctor Tiffany hwa peng I believe is the ENT. About her cochlear implant. She was given some information detrimental to the choice of implant  the day before Thanksgiving and we were not informed about it until 6 days later after they have already know about this issue. On top of that as my fiance was checking in they then tell her there are more symptoms to getting this surgery done such as swelling that is supposed to get worse after 2 days. Which to me is information that should be given before the surgery is even a thought not the day of surgery. Next we had to wait literally 2 days before this surgery to get a time and place. Pre operation instructions and everything else. I have reached out to speak with supervisors administrators ever the doctors preforming the surgery or care and have been met with a we will call you back. No I have not received a call back about any of these issues. And this has been going on for over 6 months now. This entire penn medicine needs to be shut down. Pending an investigation into patient well-being and misdiagnosis of patients. My fiance would not have had to go through this surgery if this hospital system was able to diagnose a stroke. Or better yet give her the prenatal care she needed during our pregnancy which we lost in the process of them trying to determine what was wrong with her she has been to this hospital over 18 times not necessarily this location but as far as I'm concerned they are all the same location. Hospitals should not have their practices scattered all over the city so you need to find the exact place to leave a review. I would not have given them one star but I needed to in order to write a review. I will copy and paste this entire post to the other penn med sites. With hopes I get some type of response. I am also seeking legal assistance with this matter.|Just reached out looking for help. They told me that my doctor has to refer me, my doctor won't. So I guess that because my current doctor sucks and won't refer me, the expectation is I should just eat dirt and deal with it. Wow, good stuff. I always heard that teaching hospitals were good, I guess that will not be my experience.|This is an utter disappointment that after coming here since 2011 I have been treated in a manner no one should have to be. I have been trying to get Epidurals in my back since 2021 they know the Spinal Stenosis Sciatica and chronic pain that I suffer with.
They used covid as an excuse for not having a scheduler on hand amongst that no one called me to schedule my epidurals. When I kept calling it was like I was bothering them. I just left there today and the nurse practitioner did nothing for me . I took 3 buses
there now taking 3 to get back home. Once again
she claims the Scheduler will call me back to get me in for my Epidurals that I should have had last year before my Cervical Spine was fused. Okay

My dad worked at the mill for 20+ years and it destroyed him and then he worked at a golf course maintaining the grounds for another 9 years and  that finally did the damage now he's disabled and ""physicians"" refuse to do their jobs, we did and do  our jobs, do your's.|My first visit to Good Samaritan Pain Clinic was January 2,2012. I have severe ostio and rheumatoid arthritis that obviously causes constant pain. Dr Hannah began with an evaluation and from there started looking at how to control my pain so i can function as best i can. She took the time to not only look at my medical issues but get to know me as to the type of activity and work i am able to do. She has fought the insurance companies for me and followed their protocol to the best of my interest not theirs. Some things she tried did not work but she kept up and found a regiment that works for me so i can function at my job and personal life. Yes there are times when Dr Hannah cant spend a whole lot of time with me but i am not her only patient and that is understandable. When i do have a concern she pays attention and does what she can to help the issue. Not only Dr Hannah but the whole staff is genuine in their care and concern about each patient they see. They are also just a friendly group of people who can make you smile when you are in serious pain. I thank them greatly for their care and concern with my medical issues.|What a great staff!  I was pleasantly surprised with the experience.  Our experiences with Pain Clinics here in Pennsylvania have not been good until now.  The staff was pleasant and professional.  We are very pleased with Dr.  Hanna  she listened and advised, we weren't RUSHED thru the appointment and we feel that everyone was very thorough with the evaluation.  My husband and I can't stop singing their praises!|While Dr. Hanna is a good doctor, the staff is unprofessional and unreliable. Do not return phone calls, give miss information, and do not follow through. Terrible to deal with when it comes to insurance and authorizations. Have been a nightmare to deal with. Even the insurance company cannot believe the level of incompetence. Would give zero stars if google would allow it.|Received spinal injections from DR Sophie Hanna and feel that she is thorough, gentle, and very accurate.  She takes the time to explain everything.  The office staff has always been kind to me.  Will not hesitate to recommend and I will be returning in the future.|The only star I give is for the staff who were very pleasant and professional. The doctor was horrible. She opened her office at 8:30am instead of the 8:00am she advertised. She was rude. She wouldn't read the paperwork or my MRI's and X-rays that I brought. She spent less than 5min with me, then told me that she wouldn't need a follow up, bye. Don't bother waiting weeks for an appointment for her. She's a disgrace to the medical profession.|what a scam. not happy. did not tell me that you must be evaluated first. until after my appointment. they told me to bring someone with me to drive me home. then the Doctor says ""that I evaluate my patients first"" NOW I already have the script for a neck injection in my hand. and they called me 3 times to schedule me after I had already been scheduled. I told my insurance provider about this. good luck with the administrative side also.

I've met some of the other doctors over the years (Jim Hedde, Dr. Lakin and Dr. Delaporta) and they are equally as wonderful.
Her response times are quick, she's compassionate, and stays educated and up to date on new medical information and literature. I can't say enough good things about this practice -- I am so grateful that I share a family doc with my little one, as well.|Dr. Delaporta is simply amazing. She listens to us clearly at every appointment and asks intuitive questions of our kids. She is responsive and knowledgeable and so very kind. We will never leave Dr. Delaporta or Direct Doctors.

It's really great having such easy access to a doctor by email any time I have a question or not feeling well. Dr. Hedde generally gets back to my emails within a few hours. I highly recommend Direct Doctors.|A new way to approach primary care that works for both patients & providers.  Dr. Hedde is available to respond to my medical concerns in a timely fashion.  If he is not available his partners also respond quickly.  Very reassuring.  He gives you options with risks & benefits to each option explained clearly.  A distinctly different experience from the industrial medical care offered by other group practices.  He takes time to listen to his patients.  Unique!  Works well for me and my partner!  Highly recommended!|Finding Direct Doctors has been such a relief for me. I am an independent business owner, so my schedule is crazy. It's nice to be able to go onto the website and be able to find a time that works for me. There's no more waiting in stuffy waiting rooms, no more dealing with confusing health insurance companies, and no more waiting MONTHS to get in to see my doctor! Dr. Lauren Hedde has been professional, friendly, and my experience with her has been fantastic. It's like chatting with a friend when I go. I have recommended her to everybody I've spoken to who has mentioned being unhappy with their current doctor. I've never had very good luck with doctors myself! I just said this morning that I love my doctor and how nice it is that I can finally say that! I never feel pressured or judged, and the office atmosphere is comforting and inviting, as well, which is something you don't always find at a regular doctor's office. I could go on and on and on. I highly recommend Direct Doctors, 110%!|I will start with, I was not a doctor person, however now knowing there are quality doctors like Dr Hedde at Direct Doctors,  not involved with the insurance industries, that care more about their patients than making money, I can honestly say I am very happy to have the peace of mind knowing, if I need a doctor, I now have one that I can contact whenever I may need to. Dr Hedde is so awesome! She is very attentive and not pushy at all. She listened to my concerns and was super supportive. I have recommended her already to many people.

I was in a desperate search for a quality pain management specialist in an effort to provide my Dad with some relief. His pain had been at a 10 or higher for the better part of 2 years or more. The pain was so severe that Dad could no longer walk without full assistance from me or a CNA. It was adversely affecting his quality of life.

I found Dr. Keith Perry from a Google search. I called Dr. Perry's office and had the pleasure of speaking with Ilana Burns who is the Practice Manager and was absolutely wonderful to speak with!! Ms. Burns was SO helpful and kind during our phone chat and she was able to schedule my Dad for an appointment with Dr. Perry.

Dr. Perry welcomed my Dad to his practice, took X-rays of my Dad's knee and immediately assessed my Dad's level of need.

As of the writing of this review, I can confidently say that my Dad's pain level has been reduced to a consistent 2 (from a previous 10+). In my humble opinion, Dr Perry has given my Dad a quality of life that he has not known in years!

Without hesitation, I would recommend Dr. Perry to anyone who is seeking relief from chronic pain. Thank you, Dr. Perry, Ilana Burns, and Dr. Perry's assistant, Giovanna for giving my Dad relief from his pain. You all should be commended for the work that you are doing.

Kindly,
Steven Palumbo
Providence, RI|In 2010, I had under-eye surgery from Dr. Perry. I asked repeatedly to have the skin lifted, due to a section of sagging skin under my right eye. He was persistent that I should have fat injections instead. I finally gave in to his advice and got the fat injections. For about 3 months, it looked ok, but as time went on, it became worse than it was before I saw him. Now, it's just over 12 years later and my right eye looks absolutely horrible!! The fat STRETCHED the sagging skin! If I could go back in time, I never would have walked through his door! Now I am faced with having corrective surgery because of his failure. Do NOT trust this so-called doctor!!! His only concern is making sure he gets paid. I speak from experience after numerous calls about my eye, only to hear nothing. You all have been warned. As a side note, I found out AFTER I had my surgery that he had his license suspended before because of allegedly allowing non-certified people do injections in his clinic. Feel free to do a checkup on him to see for yourself. Guess that explains why he put a clause in the contract, before surgery, stating that I can not sue him. Smart move on his part because I definitely would have dragged him through court! I just wish I could rate this MINUS 5 stars!|I go here for pain management.  Ive gotten nerve blockers injected into my shoulder, back, and neck. The staff is very friendly and professional.  Dr. Perry is great at putting his patients at ease before and during the procedure.

I met with Bryant(who no longer works there for personal reasons) I think the year was 2020 or 2019. She explained everything to me gave me the injections and I got relief. The next appointment she also gave me injections for my hips. That went fine. I had an injection done by Dr. Handel in my s.i. joint. I looked this up on you-tube because I wasn't familiar with a procedure like this. The procedure did not go the way I anticipated, it felt rushed and I ended up with a terrible headache for two weeks. I chose to never have that done again. It also didn't last as long as I anticipated from based on all my research.  Bryant told us she was leaving the practice, (not happy, because she was so good and kind and professional).. My next appointment was with Michael for trigger point injections. He was a nervous wreck and I felt like I had to make him comfortable about giving me these shots. Then I knew that I was in trouble. He kept knocking on Dr. Handel's office door for help with the shots because he said he wasn't sure how to give this shot to me. This isn't what any patient wants to hear. My husband and I weren't even on 95 south yet and I was in horrible pain. I never went back again. I called and cancelled all of my appointments. There's a reason why every staff member left the practice. Do your research. Everyone that worked there at that time was a woman. Google his name and see what you find out. I just did and that is the reason for my review today. People need to know. I myself was horrified to learn this.|Excellent physician & center! Patient and kind. Every employee who works here is so nice!|The Handel Center's Michael Cobbs listened to me and did not dismiss my complaints.

Accepts Insurance and handles P-Auths faster than my PCP.  In my original visit, we developed a treatment plan with a group of Physical Therapists where after analyzing the colleague's findings from established visits the Handel Center recommended moving in the direction of occipital injections to mitigate headaches -- The headaches were so bad light would induce nausea!

I was in bad shape and he gave me back my quality of living without constant pain. It took some time I was a mess but he did it. His professionalism and compassion and attentiveness goes beyond saying for myself. I have retired in Florida  Winters but was having some serious problems and flew back in December for a cervical epidural which was successful. Thank you Dr.Handel for arresting the intense pain.

Right now they are closed. According to the sign, they will be reopening at One Eddie Dowling Hwy. (The old Walgreen's) once Dr. Hussain's office moves there.

There STILL isn't any sign of One Eddie Dowling Hwy opening! I would just expect to continue going to another Urgent Care.|This place needs to be sued,and forced to close. The pain management closed it's door then sent all patients to Pawtucket office ultimately dropping all the north Smithfield patients out in the cold no fore warning or help in finding new pain management. Place is run by clowns.|Used to be a great pain management clinic. Since this new NP it not the same at all. Used to be a kind caring Dr. that listened to you. She is a control freak if you don't want to do what she wants she gets mad at you for having a mind of your own. Changed everything and now wonders why I'm having more of a problem with my pain. She's not understanding or compassionate. Very cold and blunt. She shouldn't be working in pain management.|The website and sign on the door says they open at 8am. Wrong. They open when a provider decides to get there. I waited until 8:40 in the parking lot because they do not open the doors until a provider gets there. What's the point of hours if they don't matter. Mind you - this is the second time this has happened to me there. Previously the LPN took me in and saw me (super nice) and was able to get the meds I needed for a sinus infection.|One of the best experiences I've ever had going to see a doctor. The staff at the front desk where kind and patient. The nurse was gentle making sure to not cause any more pain than I was already in. The doctor didn't waste any time giving me a diagnosis. She seemed genuinely concerned of the swelling in my throat (I had a bad case of strep) to where she had the nurse give me a steroid shot to help me breathe as well as an antibiotic shot to get things moving.
I've gone to the ER many times in my life and I'd be lucky to get a Tylenol for any kind of relief. Plus waiting in the waiting room for hours!!
Never going to the ER (if I can help it) I will always go here. This place is the best place to get real care!|The nurse assistant was very nice but the doctor or LPN was not she was rude talked over me while I was trying to ask questions ,she showed no empathy for my situation. She seemed like she needed some meds herself  and to top it I'm still in chronic pain...|I called yesterday and was told it was a walk in clinic and they close at 4 taking last patient at 3:39. I told them I was in my way and got there at 2:50 and the doors where locked!! Tried calling and the answering machine said they were closed!! There was a young lady in there but she said she was working on the other side and said she had no idea what was going on. Wish they would of just told me they were closing, have a severe sinus infection and was light headed and dizzy and then I had to drive to Cumberland to the next walk in clinic. I was not happy!!!!|I just left this location. I will never recommend or return after the nightmare I just experienced. I understand that being a receptionist can be a difficult task at times. However, the lack of professionalism, empathy, and respect was appalling. First, I will say the main issue was verification of my health insurance. Apparently, your receptionist Jennifer could not handle being on hold with BCBS of RI because she had better things to discuss with another associate about a particular alcoholic beverage she enjoys and purchases it somewhere in Attleboro. I was not only in pain but I was disgusted by her attitude. I let her know that I had just spoken with a BCBS representative and her response was, ""well, I was just on hold with them for a half hour and this is the reference number."" I apologize for the inconvenience and politely requested the forms that I had just filled out. Since, she had written the reference number on the first page. I was driven straight to BCBS branch in Lincoln, RI to get the issue resolved which took less then ten mins. As I was limping away on a potentially broken ankle stubbed on the side of the chair. I literally thought I was going to pass out from the pain. I returned to the same walk-in which didn't even offer a wheelchair I might add. I handed the receptionist the same exact forms, license, and insurance card. Her exact response, ""Is it the same insurance card?"" I responded yes and told her everything has been taken care of, and I assured her that she can call to verify once again. She throws her hands in the air and says,  ""I am not waiting on hold again she's going to have to call me or you are going to have to pay."" I hope that this location has adequate video surveillance with clear audio to review how their employee treats new patients. Once again I collected my paperwork to take my business elsewhere. My mother knew I had to be seen and I was so distraught. she went in someone else quickly attended to her ""The original receptionist"" dropped the attitude and full of excuses as the other woman assisted my mother. My mom was provided with a phone and fax number and we had to return back to Lincoln where they personally called and was rudely placed on hold by Jennifer once she realized it was for me. BCBS provides her with the information she needed. Honestly, if it wasn't because I'm new to the area. I would have driven back to East Greenwich to receive my care. The rest of the staff members were kind, attentive, and professional and I thank you once again for your humility and compassion.

They refused to do anything for him. Other than giving him a shot for his foot. That didn't work
We went  to every appointment. We had to reschedule one because my grandfather passed away Unexpectedly and then 2 weeks later. My father ended up in the hospital on His death bed fighting for his life so he had to reschedule again. I told them That we were very sorry. And that I would call to schedule the appointment as soon as we could. Since we were in the hospital every day and night I lost my father not even a month after my grandfather. I have called them 4 times they will not answer the phone. today I called and they answered and told me to hold on and put me on. Hold for 25 minutes and then the phone hung up.

As a former substance abuse counselor, it's exactly how you would treat someone with a substance abuse disorder on court ordered probation.
It's not pain management, it's pain medication management. I was told ""you have the choice to stop taking the medications"" when I complained of the control and invasive requirements. I saw it as a gentle threat of ""do it, or suffer with pain and withdrawls"".
I have no choice. If you do, choose ""other"".|Liars and idiots. No concern for patients at all. Minimum wage staff at best and different every visit. Call you several times to change your visit time and date every month. Refuse to assist patients communicate with doctors. Better off in pain. Avoid this practice. Just insurance voltures. Put me on oxycodone while I was on clonazepam. Deadly mix! Doctor Adriana Desillier is a dangerous liar. She promised to check with my other docs to see if meds were ok at my first visit, as I refused any meds without approval from my other doctors. At my second visit I waited 3.5 hours in the office while they figured out where my records were. Doctor Desillier then assured my son and myself that she had cleared oxycodone with all my doctors and there were no side effects. I took the oxycodone. After feeling like i was drifting in and out of consciousness I immediately called doctor Desillier's office I was told to keep taking the oxycodone to get used to it. I did not. After contacting my doctors I learned that none of them had ever been contacted by Dr. Desillier or her office. My primary Dr. Had not heard anything from them after sending the referral. After demanding a visit with Dr. Desillier I was given an appointment two weeks later. When I confronted Dr. Desillier face to face her only answer was that they couldent pay staff to check every patients current meds. Complete change of story. When ""professionals"" like this are too lazy or incompetent to do their jobs and fail to request that they're employees do, people die! This is the same mix of drugs that killed Heath Ledger.

Never had a doctor make me want to kill myself before. Thank you Dr Adriana Desillier for discriminaing against me, calling me a disappointment of a human being as well as a disappointment of veteran and a Jerk.
You screamed at me I'm front of an office full of people and then called the cops on me to have me trespassed for your actions. I recorded the entire incident .  I Will  put you on the news. I've filed a complaint with the bar and I will also be suing you. I am a mental and physical trauma patient.  You victimized me and caused irreparel pain and suffering. You put me in such a dark place that I never wanted to go to. Doctors are supposed to help people not hurt them. You had my entire history and knowingly negligently hurt me and then on top of it the defamed my name. This group is disgusting, the doctors are disgusting, don't go here unless you want the same thing to also happen to you or worse. Additionally they sent me a bill for $400 dollars rather then Bill my three insurance cpanies as a form of   retribution. Or they are double dipping. Additionally, they put incorrect information in my medical file has a form of punishment. This place is not to be trusted. If anyone has had any similar experiences please file complaints. Stand up for your self and others.  Don't let someone get hurt for the disgusting, unprofessional behavior and treatment of this doctor's office.

Also I would like to add that they are double dipping for insurance billing me despite the fact that I have three insurances and this is a LOD injury that should be billed to the VA. They sent the bill under another pain company name. Complete Scum!|If I could give this center 0 stars, I would.  They mismanaged my case and I was unable to get a needed prescription due to their provision of the wrong diagnosis to my healthcare program.  You can never speak to the PA you dealt with because it is not allowed; the manager is always unavailable; and seeing a doctor is impossible unless you are receiving an injection.  In addition, I was told that I would need to resolve this myself with my pharmaceutical program....which is absolutely inaccurate since prescribers play the role of dealing with appeals and errors they've made in diagnosis.  After 2 weeks, I still don't have my needed medication and will now go to another location for assistance.  I believe this agency may have good PAs and the female doctor in the So.

I am thankful for his practice.|With the help of Dr. Handel's injections I was able to put off surgery for a decade. He's gone beyond the norm and helped me through some tough situations. He's a truly empathetic individual. I tried  many other doctors/shots before I found  him. His shots are very effective. He has my full trust. He's truly a top notch professional.|Before I went to Dr Handel, I was a mess.  I could barely get out of bed and tie my shoes, at the age of 43 then, he changed my life for the better.  I am able to work my physical job, and just enjoy the simple things in life because of him and his staff.  He's very caring as well, not just as a Doctor but as a human being.  He really saved me from going down a very dark hole, he helped me get off some pain medicine that was being handed out to me before, I was in a very bad place, but he cared enough to put the time and effort into helping me get off all of it, what a true professional Doctor should do.  A asset to the medical field and to society.  Just an all around great Doctor and human being.  The best!|If I could put 0 stars then I absolutely would! This guy is the biggest quack I've ever met! I can't believe he's a ""doctor""! He was absolutely terrible! He walked in on his high horse, questioning if I even have any of the illnesses/diagnoses that I have! Without looking at any images of my neck or any of my paperwork/records, or even evaluating me!! He treated me like a liar, for no reason at all! And he was making jokes about it all and being really rude! Meanwhile I'm in agony and desperate for help, wearing a neck brace and it's all limiting me so much in life but he didn't care to even look at my neck! What a waste of time! & So much aggravation that I didn't need! Save yourself the time and aggravation!!|I suspect Kelli Gonsalves and Dallas Gonsalves didn't have a clear understanding of what a physiatrist does.

Dr. Handel and his wonderful staff keep me walking and as pain-free as possible! I am so thoroughly grateful my primary doctor referred me to Dr. Handel's office and that they accepted me as a patient. They diagnosed and fixed a disabling problem no one else had been able to figure out. They truly keep me walking. There is nothing ""snake oil"" about his treatments. There is nothing ""patching, not fixing"" about his treatments either. Some chronic pain conditions cannot be fixed, but can be managed with various treatments like PT, massage, steroid injections, etc. I avail myself of the tools he offers and am able to continue to work full time, despite chronic pain conditions. He is one of my heroes.

No snake oil.

He expertly listened to what my goals were ( move without heart pain), and together tweaking meds, I achieved my main goal.
Then, in 2014 as a result of a car accident, I added yet another rare nerve pain condition. Over months,years and changing symptoms both Drs. Riber and Stanislaus listened to my original goal to move and keep active. I had a Spinal Cord Stimulator implanted in 2019 with pain relief. My symptoms stabilized, but with aging, added arthritis my pain signs changed again. No problem! I understood that meds needed to keep me active may not make all pain types disappear but all the doctors at this clinic made the right decisions to keep me active despite a disability.In past years (and currently in Slovenia) I have traveled through US, all of Canada, Europe, United Kingdom,Mexico and hopefully Asia and all because one new young doctor understands my pain conditions and what it takes to travel out of the US with appropriate medication coverage.

Anytime I have a procedure he is very positive and makes me feel very comfortable. I love his PA, Casey, that I see. She is so compassionate and explains my options in a way that I can understand them. I appreciate her, making me feel that I am a part of the team. The office is always kind and helpful to me. I would highly recommend Dr. Schuyler.|I have been a patient of Dr Schuylers for a few years now, with a chronic condition, and have always had great care.  At my first consult appt he reviewed everything with me, my test results, diagnosis, options, and recommended procedure. He was very kind and thorough with his explanations. I have had a few procedures done by Dr Schuyler over these past few years, he and his team were always professional, kind, gentle and caring. I would recommend Dr Schuyler to anyone needing a pain management Dr.
The reception staff are also very friendly and knowledgeable.  Very willing to help.|Dr. Schuyler is caring, empathetic, jovial, and gentle!
Willing to get my pain under control! Appointments are easy to schedule and office visits are quick & efficient. I have been a patient for over four years and I will continue with him.|I've been a patient of Dr. Schuyler for nearly 5 years and I can honestly say that he's been the best doctor in treating my chronic back pain. He's understanding and caring. His staff is always on point, precise, efficient, and very personable. They are all understanding to my pain and sincerely care.  I would recommend him to anyone and everyone who needs a conservative, caring, and amazing doctor. They are the best!|My appointment with Dr Schuyler was a very good experience, he was exceptiona at going over the procedure and completely put my mind at rest. He answered all my questions and took his time gooing over my problem.  I was fortunate to get an appointment the next day for the injection.
On both occasions the staff were lovely and very professional.  I would definitely recommend this practice and Dr Schuyler and staff.|I've been a patient for a couple years now. I'm seen once a month for pain management. I've had several injections and nerve ablation done. I've seen Dr. Schuyler several times during these couple years. He's always  friendly and caring. Most of the time I see his PA, which I absolutely love! She's amazing! Staff is always welcoming and friendly. I haven't had any problems or issues with getting appointments or being seen in a timely manor. Most times I'm in and out within 20-30 minutes. I've recommended Dr. Schuyler to numerous family members and friends over the last couple years.|I've been a patient of Dr. Schuyler's for over 5 years now. When I came to him I was in tears from being in so much pain. I had several herniations in my back and could not function, let alone work. After 2 months of seeing Dr. Schuyler I was finally able to function day to day. Eventually, I was able to go back to work, and now I'm even in the gym again.  I now see him every few months for injections, and follow up appointments.

It's hard to find a doctor who not only knows what they are doing, but is also excellent at it. Normally, in Charleston, when you do find a doctor like that, they don't have an office that can actually get you in to be seen. Anytime I find myself needing an appointment, or have a new area of pain, they get me in quickly. Even the appointments are quick and efficient.

Most people set out to review a doctor's office when they're upset. I've had nothing but good experiences from him and his staff. Most of them will laugh and joke with me when I come in for a visit, or ask me how I've been.

Southern Coast has had such an amazing impact on my life. The staff and Dr. Schuyler have been nothing but kind, and caring since I've began seeing them.

I don't know what the other reviews are about, but if you're looking for someone who cares, and can actually see you in a good time frame, this is the place.|I have had nothing but good service here. Dr Schuyler is a great dr. He's easy to talk to and he takes the time to explain things well. He answers your questions and makes sure you understand the answer. Great bedside manner. Everyone at his office are just as great. They will treat you well from the PA's on down to the front desk. They're not overcrowded, well maybe a little around 12 but isn't everyone? But definitely better than 90 percent of the doctors that overbook.

In my first visit with Dr. Tuel, not only did my husband and I leave with an understanding of what my problem was but, we also had an understanding of what could be done to help me. Dr. Tuel tailored my treatment, explained what I could expect and reassured us that there were additional things we could try and reviewed them with us. He was very caring, gentle understanding and reassuring. Not only was I seen at the appointment time but, we were not rushed and Dr. Tuel and his staff treated us like we were the most important people there. In the short time I've been seeing Dr. Tuel I have improved more than I could ever have hoped. I can't thank Dr. Tuel enough!|I would like to thank Dr.Tuel and his Nurse Crystal and his beautiful Wife, When you walk in you're greeted with a smile and by name. You never have to wait long to be seen. Dr. Tuel gave me my life back. I used to be in the bed 80% of the time because the pain was so bad. In my opinion Dr.Tuel is the BEST!!! I know God had a hand in choosing Dr.Tuel for me;) My family also thanks you! If you want your life back and a Doctor who cares this is the place for you.|I am so glad we came to Southern Pain Specialist (SPS). The name specialist fits them properly. A correct and very thorough exam and analysis was performed to identify my wife's pain. The Staff is Top Gun performance from the moment you show up to the moment you leave. We look forward to our next visit and getting on the road to long-term treatment of my wife's pain. Thank you to all at SPS|Dr. Tuel solved severe back and neck pain (muscle spasms) that 2 other specialists could not. I am grateful! The pain was horrible.|Dr. Stephen Tuel and his staff are absolutely wonderful! While I was in his office, I got sick and the extra lengths they all went to for my husband and me was exemplary! They really are top notch and I highly recommend anyone in need of a pain specialist.

Whereas many doctors' offices are decorated nicely, but are cool in regards to the atmosphere, Southern Pain Specialists is decorated beautifully and possesses both charm and warmth. I felt a sense of peace the first time I walked through the door and it has continued on every visit since. In short, this office doesn't just look nice. It is nice.

The excellent customer service begins at check-in and is consistent throughout the entire visit. Dr. Tuel's bedside manner is one that I wish everyone in the medical field had. Some people in the medical field become hardened to those suffering with discomfort and pain. However, Dr. Tuel, with compassion, patiently and thoroughly explains everything in such a way that the only way a patient can leave his office without understanding their issue and treatment plan is by simply not listening at all.

Southern Pain Specialists deserves a 5 star rating only because that's the highest number they can get. As I stated earlier, I highly recommend any and everyone in need of a pain specialist to consider coming to the best. It will definitely be one of the best health decisions you will ever make!

Addition to my review as of January 2024:

For the first time in years, at least 4, I have been been able to get back into life, thanks to Dr. Tuel listening to me and working alongside my gastro specialists! My gastro doctor ran tests that made him think he'd found the root cause of my pain. He told me to share it with Dr. Tuel. Dr. Tuel ran his own tests and agreed with the gastro doctor that we had possibly found the culprit. He treated me that very day. That was almost 3 months ago.

I am back to enjoying my family, being a
wife, mother and Gigi! I'm back to some cooking, baking, light housework and a little traveling. I am so very thankful for Dr. Stephen Tuel!!!|I started seeing Dr. Tuel a few months ago and since then all I can say is he's the most compassionate and caring doctor I've ever been fortunate to have.

It's not easy having chronic pain and finally having a doctor take the time to try and help me live a better life has truly been a God send.

He's entire staff have went out of their way to help and communicate with me. Other practices claim that they are the best and all that but talk is cheap. When I'm really in need few doctors have shown much interest in helping me.

If only medical professionals could realize just how much of an impact they could have with a patients quality of life by just trying to help and to listen to what the patient has to say. That is the one thing I'll say about Dr. Tuel is that he actually listens to what I have to say and seems to truly value my feedback.  He's extremely down to earth and easy to talk with.

If you're tired of hearing that other places will help you manage your pain but you just haven't been taken seriously then I would say you need to give Dr. Tuel and his practice a chance.  I feel completely confident in having him manage my care and would recommend him to anyone that is needing help.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to him and his entire staff.  I hope they realize just how much they have helped me and I look forward to growing our relationship.

Thank you so much for everything you've done for me.|Dr. Tuel is an amazing doctor.  I had nothing but top notch, no nonsense care from him and his staff. From check in to checkout each visit was smooth and I barely had to wait.  He really takes the time to listen to you and thoroughly explain everything.  Please don't go anywhere else for your pain management, you will be doing yourself a disservice.  Thank you Dr. Tuel and Staff!!!|He really cares and tries to help you as best he can. His staff are fast and caring. They talk to you as an individual not as a number. I just want people to know his lady at front who runs the office cares about all the patients, she tries to find the best way to get your bill paid.

Prior to coming here I never read any of the reviews and for me I think that was good. If I read some of the reviews I probably wouldn't have come, and that would have been unfortunate for me. My experience has been really great. I was extremely nervous about the prospect of having a needle inserted into my neck. And I expressed my anxiety to the front office staff lady, and she was reassuring and that helped settle me down. The medical staff that took my vitals and started my IV was also professional and supportive. At this point I was completely calm. Then they took me to the procedure room where Dr. Vranian and his team explained everything that would happen and what I might feel/experience. It wasn't painful for me as I was sedated. Sure you are aware that something is going into your neck/back but honestly a root canal was more painful than the injection (sorry orthodontists). But that was my experience. Post procedure I'm still feeling better than I had. Periodically I may experience slight numbness, but it doesn't last long. I'm not sure if perhaps they made changes as a result of some of the negative reviews, but I was extremely satisfied with what they provided for me. I also know when you're in chronic pain ordinary tasks become ten times harder. So I just try to manage my expectations and I appreciate every second of relief I get. Good luck to everyone on this chronic pain journey and thank you Pain Specialists of Charleston for providing this service.|I was in a car accident and went in for an MRI and went in recently for massage therapy. The massage therapist was the best I've had. I am glad I found her! Honestly, it has been a great experience all around.

Don't recommend as it was just a waste of time and money.|I was given multiple tests through Neuro, one of which I was told it takes 3-5 days to get the results. It has been over a month and I had my appointment last week and while I was 10mins away they called and canceled my appointment. They told me that the results weren't in. How do you not know if the results are not in at least the day before your patients appointment, and to cancel it 25min before the appointment!? Now, a week later and they will not reach out to me to reschedule, and I have called dozens of times with no answer.  I am a veteran so I am reporting them today to Patient advocacy to make sure no one else from base gets referred to them.|Helpful and friendly staff!

I have been a patient here for six years, the sole location I have seen for my back pain. I spoke with the director today, and they are refusing to help me for a Nexus letter for the VA. She refused to provide any written policy as ""its not a written standard but rather spoken."" She mentioned paying another agency to write the letter but was mute when I asked why I could not pay them. It is evident they don't care about me but rather are solely concerned with things they can bill to my insurance. If you could potentially need medical evidence for the department of Veteran Affairs in the future, I suggest utilizing another clinic within the Tricare network.",2025-02-08|2023-08-29|2024-12-11|2025-01-29|2024-11-14|2024-12-31|2024-12-18|2024-09-19,5|5|5|1|1|5|5|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",70.2|66.4|59.8,"Onsite services, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJV8Jxib1h_ogRs9WYYoZBCKA,127

Dr Koranloo is awesome!! He also has a great staff that are always friendly!!|My husband has been coming here for years with no issues until this spring and summer where Charlotte the office manager did not return his call and get him on the schedule for his back injections. When we finally got in, she complained to us about the doctor not giving her time off and how she was going to leave soon. It was very unprofessional. We finally got him scheduled after his hip surgery and he came down with Covid and had active symptoms. I called and told them he wouldn't be able to come in. She said she would call me back to reschedule. She never did. I called again and got him an appointment. When my husband called to confirm, she informed him that he has to pay $150 no show fee because he had Covid? Beware- a practice that would put its patients' health in jeopardy by forcing people to come in with communicable diseases or pay $150 is not someone who should be treating patients; especially when you consider many pain management patients are immune compromised. Charlotte also told my husband she had told me there would be a $150 fee. She did not. She lies about the patients and family members. She gossips about the office girls and the doctor. Find a more professional practice.|I have dealt with lower back pain for 8 years. I have seen multiple orthopedic surgeons, tried yoga for 6 months, did chiropractic care for 7 months, went to 2 different physical therapists and did multiple rounds with each. I had tried basically everything, not to mention other pain management doctors and using the medicines they prescribed.

I wasn't until that I started seeing Dr. Koranloo that I started to get longer term relief. I gave me a level of patient care that other health care professionals had not given. I hate it took so long to find him, but I'm glad that I did.

If you're dealing with lower back pain....he's the man.|When you walk in to the office you're automatically greeted by two wonderful caring ladies. The office is immaculate. Dr. Koranloo takes his time to listen to you before he responds with advice. I recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone. I've always been given the best  treatment solutions.|Best of the best. Got in right away after my referral. Have suffered with severe pain over two years with severe buttocks pain and lower back pain. Multiple physicians, tests, imaging, PT, chiropractor, ice, heat, TENS unit, massage, muscle relaxers, pain medication, bed rest, etc without much relief. Turns out the primary cause of my pain was overlooked by everyone except the chiropractor and here- sacroiliac joint and hip. Instead my pain was being blamed on old back injuries by others. Glad I got a second opinion. The doctor listened very closely and was the first to really do a physical assessment- actually touch my muscles, joints, reflexes, strength, gait, etc. Scheduled for a procedure right away.|I could go on forever about Dr.  Koranloo and his team with how professional and knowledgeable they are about this practice.  If you have pain anywhere and you need a pain management doctor Lake Carolina Pain and Spine is the place to go.  I highly recommend this place.  I'm a testimony.

Keep up the amazing job!!|Lake Carolina Pain and Spine offer compassionate care that you absolutely will have a hard time finding anywhere else. I've had numerous complex health problems ranging from neck, joint, and nerve pain. Dr. Koranloo (Dr. K) takes his time with you and allows you to explain your health concerns and executes a well articulated plan for you to get back to a healthier place if possible. He has great bedside manner, and listens to concerns. He also offers great feedback and is incredibly knowledgeable. In my experience, I've been offered compassionate care with every visit, a listening ear, and helpful medical advice to help me make informed decisions about my health. Great people, and amazing Doctor, I highly recommend.|From my first time, I felt at that I was in the right place. The two ladies were courteous, friendly and professional .

Sarah Hensley  is my favorite  Doctor! I have MS and if anyone understands MS it is a challenge  to find doctors. Dr. Hensley listens to me . She is very compassionate and so knowledgeable. She puts her heart into her work. Her staff ( nurses, all staff) are so special too if I went in there so sad they would not ignore me. They would try to cheer me up. A+A+A+ sincerely Lia White.....|I started having severe back pain. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Han.
He is very caring and said he could help me. For starters while waiting for a MRI results he prescribed a medication that has
Helped me.. After my MRI I will see him again..|I had an appointment with my pain management doctor today. I was supposed to see Dr. Han.  Or I was supposed to have an appointment. My second visit with this doctor was going to be back in April but I had to change it. When I called back to reschedule they gave me the date of June 4th which is today at 1:45. I called twice to confirm the appointment. Once last week and again Monday. They confirmed today's appointment time in both phone calls. I get to the office and I am told at check in there is no record of an appointment in their computer or written down. The woman at the front desk who scheduled and confirmed today's appointment talked to someone else to see if they could work me in. Nope. They wouldn't make any attempt to work me in while already at the office because I didn't have a voicemail or appointment card to prove I was supposed to be there today. Well, when you call and make an appointment by phone or answer the phone before it goes to voicemail there will be no appointment card or voicemail to show. Looking at reviews for their office online, apparently other patients have had this problem with them. I am so frustrated from not getting the help I need and from doctors not taking me seriously when I say I'm in pain and it's getting worse that I am seriously considering going online and buying pain meds from one of those websites you don't need a prescription for and whatever happens is what happens and I'm willing to take that chance even if it just gives me five minutes of relief.|Very clean and polite. Everyone there have been so nice to me. When I met Dr Loudermilk he had all my records and he and his assistant knew what and how to address my pain. Thank You, Your Assistant and Your Staff|My experience with my doctor(Dr J) has been GREAT, along with his nurses, but upon my follow up appointment, I was pulling into the parking lot, and at the time didn't not realize it was a worker of piedmont management. When I pulled in, I left my car door open to transfer my child to my mom in her vehicle. Upon doing so the lady is in her car wavering her hand up at me, because I had left my door open. I proceeded to close my door, and walk into the office. Only to be checked in by her team member in the front desk(she was great!), further more then proceeded to talk about me to her team mate, as if I was not in the office and could not hear what was being said about me, or as if it wasn't 7:45am and there wasn't a FULL parking lot with MULTIPLE spots. I urged to make a formal complaint, due to being so unprofessional, and just plain rude. I was told ""I will talk with her"".|3/5.  More thoughts on the following day. I don't want to complain without offering a solution. This is only a Suggestion... incorporate enough time to complete paperwork in the time for appointment. For example, since my appointment was at 10.30, making my appointment at 10a would've been a good idea. What you think?  Giving two appointment times on 2 different days using 2 different ways to communicate can be time consuming and confusing. What you think?

My PCP sent a referral to Piedmont Comprehensive Pain and after 2 months I got an appointment after I made several calls to make this happen. My appt was scheduled at 10.30; I arrived at 10.30. So what's the problem... right? Receptionist asked why I arrived at 10.30 because a voicemail was left for me to come in early to complete paperwork, and I would have to reschedule. This is laughable!!|I was referred to them from the VA. The doctors are really nice and are easy to talk to. My paper work for accommodations for work, was never turned in on time, but the office.
I had to have an MRI done and I had to coordinate the MRI, myself between the VA and doctor's office. For approximately three weeks I had to call between the VA and doctors office, because they did not read the packet the VA sent them when I started there, explaining what they are supposed to do. After finally having the MRI completed, I have tried multiple times to make a follow up appointment and no one will answer or return my phone call. If you are being sent here RUN!

I wish I had found this practice years ago, this is truly a first class, pain management facility, focusing on identifying the causes of pain and creating a plan for targeted pain, relief, with many many state of the art, new technologies and techniques and knowledge of how to treat the pain, They seem interested in actually treating the pain, versus just pushing pharmaceuticals. If you truly want your pain addressed, I would highly recommend making an appointment, you will not be disappointed. I am very grateful to be a patient.
UPDATE::
Well, I cannot believe how wrong I was!! They don't listen, don't care, and just want to use as much of your insurance on procedures as possible, and make you give a urine sample every time you go in, even if they aren't prescribing you any opiate!! Yesterday, December 10 was my last appointment, after arriving to my appointment with the building sign saying they have moved, no one received an email letter or anything that they were moving, and I know this because four of us arrived at the new location at the same time And no one knew that they had moved in the provider wasn't even there! I had a severe allergic reaction to a pain, patch, and not one person called to check to see how I was or if it was getting better, I had to call poison control myself. These are the sheep and wolves clothing.! After speaking with the other four patients while waiting for the provider to show up, we The exact same experiences, they don't care!! i'm sorry I was so wrong in my initial review, I was very hopeful and thoroughly frustrated and disappointed. For almost a year now, I have presented 10+ Pain, requested tests to be performed because something is definitely not right, they have no interest in helping people just making money off of their procedures, highly recommend you find an alternative, If you want doctors and nurses that will actually listen to you and address your needs. Good luck.|This was my first visit with Dr. Baksh at the Regent Park office, so I was a little uncomfortable in the unfamiliar surroundings. I was
soon put at ease by the friendliness of the staff. This office is much closer to my home than the Greenwood office where I have been going for years. Dr. Baksh is a great doctor and I would go to the Ashville office to see him if I had to!|I had a total of 3 visits with Javid. The office temperature thermometer was over 80 in the summer, so it actually felt hotter. They claimed the air conditioner was broken but that was story months ago and I have asthma. Not only does he not listen, he does not explain imaging results. My last visit ended with him being pissed off and upset, flailing his arms in the air at me because I told him my neurosurgeon preferred I go to another clinic to receive my cervical epidural. He can't control his emotions so why would I feel comfortable with you sticking a needle in my neck. They kept pressuring me to go ahead and get the injection before I left his office but I said no. They even went as far as to try and hang my pain medication over my head by saying they won't refill my medication. I was disgusted at that point and told them I don't care about that! I'm going to do what my neurosurgeon tells me to do. They even began to bad mouth her. You will never see me again and I will tell others of your behavior!|Dr Baksh is the BEST! When I met him I was in horrible shape and barely getting around with a cane and walker. The pain doctors I saw before him, just threw pills at you and didn't offer any real hope. Dr Baksh really works so hard to get you back on your feet.  While I'll always have spinal problems.  I'm doing better than I have in years. And it's so great to have an awesome doctor, that offers real solutions that get you living again. I have been with him for years.  And highly recommend him. The office staff is also amazing!|I highly recommend this medical facility for any of your pain needs.  Their staff are very knowledgeable and treats you with dignity and respect.

I came to this clinic by ref from Dr for consistent pain. They decided to give me an epidural they gave me sedation medicine to relax me which was either too soon before epidural or amount was not enough. I was in SEVERE pain I was crying. While ""recovering"" in waiting room a gentleman nurse (his name was not Hannah) went over all my discharge information. Later, I read my visit summary and a nurse Hannah wrote that at time of discharge I said I had received greater than 80% relief WHICH I DID NOT SAY NOR DID I HAVE RELIEF. I wasn't even asked if I had any relief. Even my driver said I never said that. When I called the office manager she said she would have to look into why they used that ""verbiage"" and would call me back. Here we are 5 days after I called and still have not heard back from them nor have my notes been updated. Those notes are what are submitted to insurance and primary Doctor. They lied claiming I had relief when I didn't. The Pain Dr even said it would be a few days to a week before I saw any relief so how could I possibly have had any relief immediately after the epidural. I advised my primary of all of this and he apologized for the horrible experience I had and said he would not send me or anyone else back there. I would advise to stay clear of this place. I had heard from other people how unsatisfied they were with Trident, I wish I would have listened.|I had a terrible experience with Dr Devin Antonovic. I am a breast cancer survivor and I have been left with chronic pain in both upper arms & hands from radiation. My surgeon sent me to him to test a stimulator implanted to help with pain.

I will not be going back.|Let me just start by saying that PAIN doesn't always look or feel the same to everyone..... with that being said in this photo below you see the face of myself in severe pain to the point I'm literally crying silently in front of my own husband because all I did was trim some of his hair and that's all it took for me to hurt so badly within 3-5 minutes , seems like such a simple task ,but for myself not so much.. you see i have degenerative disc's and bone spurs in the thorasic region of my spine as well as arthritis in my si joint and my lower lumbar section has something else I can't remember honestly I've been told I have so many different things going on with my back it's hard to keep up.. im only 35 and I feel just like my 58 year old mother ON A DAILY BASIS! I had a tree fall on me at age 11 it's a wonderful i came out not so harmed and alive, multiple work related accidents,  car wrecks, God only knows how many random falls ive taken for no reason whatsoever just walking.... simply walking i get a sharp sudden pain in my ""tailbone"" that causes me to immediately stop in place and be unable to move.. brain and spine doctor said this is drop foot stemming from my si joint .... I simply bend over and the thorasic region of my spine ""pops and cracks"" 10 times in 3-4 different places..I WALK AROUND SWEARING MY HIP OR TAILBONE IS FREAKING BROKE...everytime i barely move my tailbone/hip/si joint whatever pops and cracks... I struggle with pain DAILY, I can't sleep at night bc i am in pain and can't get comfortable. If I do sleep, most times I wake up crying in pain. It's not always so easy to just ""get up and just go to the e.r."" either, and they have more important things to worry about than for myself to go in there how ever many times needed bc im in pain. (Yeah I actually stop to think about that! Insane right!?) THIS IS NOT FREAKING NORMAL...... But for all these doctors to tell me what's wrong with me, then refer me to pain management and pain management basically not give a flying crap and basically REFUSE treatment bc ""you're 35 im not giving you pain meds and an ablation is too extreme for someone your age"" and then ALL BUT called a junkie and told to ""make lifestyle changes,lose weight , quit smoking and ill stop being in pain, you don't need pills, you want to be around for your kids im not giving you narcotics"" WHAT!? Are you freaking kidding me.. first off, I am quiting smoking slowly, I am losing weight*thank you ozempic* i have made lifestyle changes, i do try to excersise but it causes only more pain for DAYS, I have specifically sought after some course of treatment for quite some time now and spent years being told "" there's nothing wrong with me"" , I have specifically stated i don't want to be opioid dependent the way my mother has been forced to for over 20 years due to not being treated medically/surgically the way she was supposed to. Yes I finally through my doctor found something that works (5/325 oxycodone/tylenol ) *woohoo omg i can actually freakin function and spend time with my children happily instead of suffering in silence (bc they notice it all), omg I can actually get things done around my house and not be in complete agony* OK GREAT,FINALLY a medication IS IN FACT HELPING , bc God knows the 14 other medications I've been told to try haven't done a damned thing!* So I want to personally thank Trident Pain Center ON MCSWAIN DR. IN WEST COLUMBIA for NOT treating me the way I was told I needed treatment by lexington brain and spine (pain management,  pain medication and an ablation to kill the nerves that are affecting my pain). Thank you for NOT prescribing anything let alone what I actually need a refill on to function daily the way my 35 year old body freakin ""should.

Doctor was nice and seemed like he was going to help him but didn't. Medications never got sent in to pharmacy and my husband was seen last Thursday. I even called and left a message and still nothing. Haven't heard anything about doing PT. Haven't gotten TENS unit. Can't do injection in his back for over 2 weeks!! Very bad experience!!  Don't go if you need immediate relief because you won't get it!!|While the doctors are nice and take their time talking with you, they don't tell you about the immense pain you will be in during and after an epidural injection. The epidural helped the shooting pain down my arms but didn't touch the neuropathy. I still have neck pain which was to be expected. They prescribed me medication to alleviate my pain, however, it is currently helping no one. The P.A. won't return the pharmacist's calls for confirmation of the dosage of the prescription. The Pharmacy will not fill it without speaking to him. They have sent Trident Pain Center West Columbia 2 request for a return call and I have called once and messaged them per the Pharmacist's request. So basically my ""pain management clinic"" isn't managing my pain at all. This situation is very ironic after being told ""pain contracts are really about good communication"".
If good communication and actually having your pain managed is your goal, don't come here. They will give you the warm and fuzzies like they care but then leave you in pain (it's now been 5 days since the first request for a call back) because they refuse to pick up a phone to call a pharmacy. . Oh well, I was in pain before I came here so it's just more of same. Just keep your expectations on the floor and if you are lucky you might be pleasantly surprised or you might get exactly what you expected in the first place.|The staff is very caring, helpful and friendly.   The staff work very well together, this creates a positive office environment.
This team of wonderful people are working together to give the best possible care to their patients.

Having pain disorders issues is  a terrible disease, that is hard to treat!!!
In most cases there is no cure.

For example, some people CAN NOT take steroid medications or NSAIDs.   The use of these medications is one of the most preferred treatments for chronic pain.  For example steroid shots on nerve blockers are offered here.

It is the goal of these doctors, at the Trident Pain Management Center's to help their patient live productive lifestyles, as pain free as possible.

This can be frustrating and challenging to both the doctors and the patients, when the above mentioned medications can not be used.
The doctors and physician assistants, at this Trident Pain Center work hard at facing this challenges.   They try to reach the goals of each individual patient.

Thanks you, to the whole entire team at The Trident Pain Center in Lexington, SC.|Had an appointment today with Dr A.

I have trypanophobia. Diagnosed 30 years ago. Did therapy for it and tried hypnosis. So it is not new. Yet, I was refused an appointment because I have a severe reaction to needles and injections.

They have a tv on at the same time as music that is played so loud that you can't hear anything but the music.  Is this a Doctor's office or a night club?|I have always received excellent and compassionate care from Dr. Kline.  He's at the top of the list of the best doctors I've ever seen.  He expertly treats me on the occasions I've received interventional procedures.  His OR nurses ensure that I feel comfortable and are quick to return my call if I have a question.  I also receive excellent and informative care from his PAs, Miriam and Nick.  They both offer me active solutions and a treatment plan for specific issues.  They really listen to me and never make me feel rushed.  I can't say enough good things about their outstanding practice.|All staff is always so courteous and friendly from the front desk to the nursing staff and PA Miriam. Everyone has been awesome. They are always willing to answer any questions I have and have excellent communication skills. I'm so glad I found this office when first moving to SC.

You don't talk about a patient at any point in time. They are there to give a service NOT AN OPINION. I will never return, in fact I cancelled my follow up appointment. There are many spine centers both Conway and Myrtle Beach. No need to go to a place where the staff is so unprofessional. Talking about a patient right in front of another patient! Seriously?? Disgusting. My daughter said she over heard them talking about me after my procedure. She was going to confront the staff but decided not to.  Too many good and professional spine places to go to.

EVERYONE here is knowledgeable, super kind, and they've gone out of their way to help me.  I no longer have to take any medication.  I'm doing different injections to control the pain, and it's working well.
Dr. Z is so kind and seems truly caring about my health and comfort.  He did an ablation procedure on me today, and the appointment went great!  He explained everything as he was doing it, and it made the visit pleasurable.
The medical technician was fantastic!  Full of personality and truly caring!
Lori at the front desk was amazing and I am truly appreciative of her.  The sweet girl that checked me in was kind and considerate, too!
I'm so happy and fortunate the office is now running things as they should.
Dr. Z...please stay and don't leave!  This place is finally running accordingly, and it's a pleasure to be with you!
Thank you from the bottom of my heart guys!|My mom has been going here for 2 years. Now that Dr Patel is not there anymore and they only have 1 dr she has had to reschedule her appointment and I have been trying for two weeks to get someone to call me back. And now she is about out of her medication. The doctors have been good until recently.|Dr. Has absolutely zero empathy. swear she looked as if she was completely out of it. Never seen a Dr present herself in such a poor condition. Do not waste your time if you truly need someone who has a heart, because she does not. Would give a negative score if possible. Nurse brought in my current MRI results and she never even looked at it. Take my advice look elsewhere.|I'm gonna just put my heart in this review. Leaving a review of any kind for any place is not something I normally(if ever) do, but I feel like this is important.
I've been a patient for well over 2 yrs. and I've experienced both the good and bad within this practice. Let me simply say that I'm so glad that I hung in there with Superior. More than once I almost left for several different reasons. I do agree with the majority when they say some past employees have been unprofessional, unreliable, un-caring, etc...
I made the decision to give the last new Dr. a final chance before seeking another pain mgmt. program and now I'm glad that I did.
Dr.Z' has been great so far and has made me feel as if he really gives a d*#! about my overall health. I don't think all people realize how strict the FDA is on the pain specialist these days. Their hands are tied to a certain extent and their lively hood can easily be at stake if certain guidelines aren't met. It's not always their faults that stupid people abuse pain drugs to the point that those of us who actually depend on the relief it can give us to survive daily have to suffer because of their greed. So, try not to be so judgemental before the whole truth is known.
Also, on a more personal note I'd like to thank Lori. She has gone above and beyond her job requirements for me and I'm sure others. She's a trooper and has stayed with the office thru it all. Thank You Lori, you're the best!|I've been coming here for 6 years and I've never had any problems with the staff or doctors. They really listen to all of your needs. Lori at the front desk is always so compassionate and she helps you really understand the way things work.|1/14/25 - My visit was very pleasant! All the staff members were very professional and polite.
Tatyanna was especially friendly and helpful at my visit. She was very patient and kind.|I went for my visit almost 2 weeks ago had to take a urine specimen and so how it got lost so I had to drive back there remind u I live a hour away and work during the week to go take another one which I find crazy bc how do u lose someone's urine makes no sense but whatever I went and took it again 3 days ago hoping to have my medicine before the weekend but nope nothing and they closed at 12. All I know is dr Patel was way better and got everyone their medicine when it was due not give them the run around everytime u call them. Then the one lady was so rude to me claiming she returned all my calls which was a lie bc I have my call records where my 10+calls was only returned once!! I just don't know about this doctor then wants to change everyone medicine to these patches. Why change things especially for patients who have been on the meds that work for them. Something isn't right about this new doctor and I would love to know how  I can speak to someone over the whole place!! I know there is more people not happy about all this!! Let speak up ppl!!|I have been a patient of Dr. Patel's since 2015 now . This new doctor prescribe me a new medicine that melts in your mouth and I'm fine with trying it but I cannot afford $60 every month. I called back and asked is there anything cheaper he said no so now I'm without any medication ! He probably never had a pain in his life no more than a headache and doesn't understand what chronic pain is. I went and paid 60$ for that medication and it's mint flavored.

Unfortunately, I have gone to a number of specialists and surgeons with  degenerative back issues and chronic pain as a result. Also, my brother and sister-in-law are MD's as opposed to DO. It goes against my professional ethics to speak negatively about another professional and I know that a person can't ""make"" me feel uncomfortable unless I allow it!
Dr. Patel strolled in, sat down far, far too close in my personal space and just started drilling me with questions. It was VERY rude for him to do this - it is difficult enough to have to deal with talking about pain that has taken away almost all quality of life. He showed no empathy, he told me he would not prescribe the dosage of pain medication I have been taking unless I was a terminal patient. It is 10-15 mg of oxycodone. I was dumbfounded. I thought going to pain management was an effort to work together and find a path forward with the end result being less pain medication and more quality of life. Dr. Patel flipped through my paperwork, told me immediately that he would not take me on as a patient, then he spent a good bit of time telling me how I had to accept that I would never be pain free and pretty much (in so many words) said I had to learn to deal with it. He said there was nothing he could do for me, that I needed to speak with a surgeon AFTER I told him I was very skittish and almost phobic about further surgery due the horrific experience I had with my first surgery.
He sent me out the door with a prescription for pain medication that was less than half of what I've been taking for at least 7 years. He knew I am opioid dependent, did not care and sent me away with, in his own words...(just enough so that I didn't get sick) until I could find another Dr.
The stigma attached to opioids is awful and it is embarrassing enough to have to talk about it and deal with it regularly with any Dr., but Dr. Patel left me feeling dirty, like a criminal practically, that doesn't even include his extreme physical invasion of my personal space. I had to ask him to back away it was so nerve racking. It felt like his face was less than 8-10 inches from mine. It was a creepy and extremely derogatory experience.
I have never and I hope I never will feel obligated to leave a review like this about any other fellow professional again. I hope someone is reading these reviews about Dr. Patel.|I had the unfortunate opportunity to be refer to Doctor Patel.
He is supposed to be an advanced pain. Doctor medicine, well, he doesn't play in my injuries, I have heard he did dissolve. And does the generative disk 5 of them? And I'll draw Arthritis in the rapid.  I've been in 2 car accidents not due to full of my own. When in April 2023 and then another one in November of 2024 in which my car was told t-bone I feel like a human crash stunning, but he came in shook my hand it was like I was shaking him with the devilcame in with a snout.  And didn't want to give me any type obtain medication. He didn't want to do anything but put some type of paying patch that he was probably in with on the phone. I'm a suitable company to get a kick that what is wrong with these doctors? Some of them? I'll never go back there again. And I suggest you don't visit this place either.|I came for my first visit with "" Doctor "" Patel after suffering for two years. I've had 3 back surgeries in less than two years. I've done injections and physical therapy. This pain is debilitating. I've been an ICU RN for 24+ years. Of course my back would hurt at times. A little Tylenol and a heating pad and I would be good to go.  This excruciating pain did not start until I had a flu shot that cause an autoimmune response. I've been struggling since that time. I never knew I had any structural issues with my back until all the imagine and testing done at that time.  I still felt that the autoimmune response is what caused this to begin. Long story short .. neurologist said "" it's your back .. it's your back "". I finally see neuro surgeon. Three back surgeries later and I am still unable to do much of anything. To say my life was ruin by a flu shot sounds ridiculous. This is my reality. My primary care physician is amazing. He has been with me every step of the way. We decided to try pain management to see what they could offer. The NP I saw was wonderful. Dr Patel was horrible. Walks in the room and states "" I'll give you 2 5mg a day and nothing more."" "" you can see someone else if you don't like that ."" Not a hello. How are you? Nothing. Absolutely zero compassion. I wasn't arguing him for more meds. I didn't even say anything. He also told me if I've had this pain for two years "" it's never going to get better."" I bawled like a baby. Why is he a pain management doctor?? To treat people who need help like that?? I'd rather eat glass shards and have explosive diarrhea after than ever see that "" man"" again. I will be calling CVS cancel anything he sent in for me. I'll suffer before I'm treated like that . Why? Why would a doctor even become a doctor if they don't care?? I want to find a way for my insurance not to pay him. He doesn't deserve one red cent for that visit. Oh and I was told I need the see a psychiatrist... really? That was the "" help "" I was offered. Almost forgot the Lyrica. Lyrica is an anticonvulsant. It was created to treat seizures 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!|I had my first visit with Dr Patel today September 19, coming from Midland pain n Neurology, who I just reported to the medical board, btw, n this guy basically judges me as a  drug addict.  He doesn't prescribe the high doses of narcotics im on and would basically do nerve blocks n when I said I was looking for both treatments he said he doesn't write for pain medication.  Really?  Then why are you in pain management and why recommend someone to go back to a Dr that they reported for just st leaving the Country n letting their Pt go into partial withdrawal?   I say partial withdrawal because I should of ran out of my meds on the 8th of September, but instead of taking them 3 x a day, I took them only at night to make them stretch to not go into total withdrawal,which if I was an Addict Dr. Patel, I wouldn't be able to do that.  You shouldn't judge someone by the medication they are on, especially when you haven't even reviewed medical records or even given me an examination.  You have no idea the struggles I go thru daily to move.  Your lack of compassion n coldness you showed me today was horrible..no wonder this office has such low reviews.  I wouldn't be surprised if you've been reported to the medical board as well.|This was my worse experience l went there because  l have a rare chronic  condition  among others condition l have to take methadone, other medications.

They changed Drs before the injection, would not help get answers for the injection problems, released records that weren't properly timed stamped, ultimately kicked us out of the building on a simple follow up visit (they scheduled and confirmed), refused to release records a year later, and was ultimately told not to contact in any way without an attorney. The picture is 4 days after the injection, and they refused us help. Still currently dealing with the situation over a year later.|I have been with this practice for months now and at no time have I ever had any problems.  The office is nice and clean, the staff is polite and nice and have been very helpful! The receptionist has always been pleasant as well as the lady who makes my appointments and checks me out. There's a male nurse who was exceptionally caring after my back injections and I kept thanking him over and over. I also know that I have to be there and signed in 15 minutes prior to my appointment. That was stated to me on my first visit. So far, they have really helped me and I really appreciate them all.|A Dr was present at intake ONLY. Request to talk with a Dr were denied.

I was working with Dr. Patel to have procedures done to alleviate said pain. My Insurance had to a couple of placebo procedures in order to be covered.  After going process (which had to be spaced out 6-8 weeks) I was to receive a total of 3 injections from Dr. Patel. I had two out of the three injections performed by Dr. Patel. The office staff rudely and unprofessionally informed me I didn't reschedule ONE appointment with enough notice (which was a mistake on my end)I so I was being dropped as a patient! I had only one procedure left to relieve pain. I wasn't given a warning. I wasn't told that I had missed any other appointments and to be mindful that this could happen. Dr. Patel, the office staff not one person said a word to me until they dropped me for missing that appointment. Unless you want to be treated like a number or dollar sign I would not see Patel! What doctor that truly wants to treat you as a human being would do that with one procedure remaining. I am a professional. I travel for business and I didn't reschedule one appointment with enough notice which was an honest mistake. It felt degrading to be dropped as a patient with only one procedure left to relieve any kind of pain. What doctor that truly wants to treat you as a person not as a $ for insurance would do that.  I have children I want to play with and not have to keep telling my little kids sorry my back is hurting. I needed to get some relief. I was praying that these would help to have one left after going through the placebo and insurance approving it and getting two procedures done by this doctor. I had one left and because I had a work trip come up last minute and was not able to give 24 hours notice I was dropped from their practice. Blessing in disguise perhaps as that is not a doctor I want treating me. I want a doctor that treats me as a person not as a number on a piece of paper. Never go to Dr. Patel unless you want to be discarded and thrown away like trash and that you don't matter .|Grrr! Rude nursing staff.
Emailed appt confirmation warned not to be late but to arrive 15 minutes early or the appointment would be automatically cancelled.
I calculated the drive there and allowed for noontime traffic. 10 minutes ahead of their deadline and nurse complained that I was ""ahead of my time"" and would have to wait in the lobby (which was fine and expected).

Make up y'all's dang mind!!! But let's not be rude!|Great group of people who explain in layman's terms and get to the heart of the problem. No wasting time either. I'm usually in and out and back home in no time.|Why are you not returning calls?

Not rude but not friendly either--set the tone for what was to come. Physician introduced himself but not the person who accompanied him (lack of common courtesy). The physician was curt, and repeated at least four times that if I sought any part of my treatment elsewhere (which I never suggested I would),  they would no longer see me. Medical history review was brief as was physical exam. I was told that while federal regulations require office visits every three months in order to prescribe narcotics (which I've been taking for past 3-4 years for back pain) this practice requires monthly visits. Seems to me nothing but greed as this serves no practical purpose that I can think of. I am a retired RN and no way in hell would I go back here due to what I perceive as greed and total lack of empathy. I insist on being treated with respect and empathy.

This is ridiculous!  I called today to try to get an a sooner appointment and I waited 6 1/2 minutes on the phone with her talking to somebody else saying this lady needs an appointment. When do you think we could get around and then finally she put me back on hold and told me that she was sorry but she had nothing available that she would make a note on my file. If something I'm available she would call me.  That is very unprofessional!!|Dr Roper was called in after I saw 3 others there who didn't spend much time, didn't explain anything, hastily didn't seem to want to bother with me.  Dr Roper, by contrast, seems very understanding, very well informed and took time to explain connections and possibilities and b ordered an MRI to get a clearer picture, since jabbing a needle in my back didnt provide much relief. Prior to Dr Roper, PA Joy seemed genuinely attentive, too.
BUT .... The office personnel leave much to be desired!! They have lost my paperwork, they have sent me running in circles between them and my insurance company saying they don't hear anything from the insurance company who also tell me they don't get any response from CS&P. I took it to them handed it to the front desk worker, and weeks later they still said they don't have it. I took another copy to Dr Roper and handed it to him directly. Like I said, he was great, and ordered an MRI. I requested a sedative because I have a history of not being able to do the MRIS without. The pharmacy said they didn't get it, at first, but they had a new employee and it was back logged. CS&P eventually returned my call a few days later, after I tried to do the MRI anyway, but could not. I can't take anything for pain. I don't take drugs. I can't even use NSAIDS because of allergic reactions, so it's not like I'm one of those addicts who just want pain drugs. I don't. I would like a nerve block in my back after 40 years of crippling pain,  -- I live 25 miles away and it is hard to get there and very frustrating when it's for wasted trips.
I am known for doing my best and voluntarily giving my best and being extremely responsible in any way I can for whoever ....  I don't make money at that. It's flabbergasting that people who do make money to be professional and efficient cannot seem to be!
I am putting my hope in Dr Roper, though; he is a fellow Veteran and knows that doing and giving our best is a matter of honor with a heart of service; characteristics one is born with, not taught to be paid for.

-- and I'm sure pain, stress, frustration, et al, following a panic attack, contribute to my exasperation and hard tone.|I mean looking out watching in it would be a great idea to have AUTOMATIC DOORS for the people that are either healing or in pain.

There excuse was they have a new system and they are not sure how to use it yet!!!!!!!!!!I feel sorry for the employees working for them!|I'll  start by saying Daphne the NP is the most wonderful, kind, and compassionate provider. I also have only had good experiences with the front desk staff. However, Dr. Patel on both occasions has been condescending and incredibly rude. I am a healthcare professional and would never speak to a patient the way he did me. I've been on the same pain regimen for years with another clinic in WA state prior to moving to SC. This most recent visit Daphne spoke with him about restarting one of my pain meds for an as needed basis. He proposed a different medication (same exact thing as the first visit) but it didn't exactly sound like what I was interested in plus I know what works for me since I had the same treatment for years. Daphne was going to have him come in to just chat with me. Dr. Patel came barging in to the room, did not even address me, sat down and started going on about how he would not prescribe the medication due to my age and it being addictive. When I slightly pushed back he continued to berate me almost making me feel like a drug seeker. I simply stated I did not appreciate how he was speaking to me. He said ""that's fine."" I said no that's actually not fine. Ultimately this  ""chat"" was going no where and I said I was going to end this appointment and leave. At this point I'm in tears and telling him to never speak to a patient the way he did to me ever again. He continued to be dismissive. I was in utter shock to me treated like this at a pain clinic. Safe to say I will never return which is such a shame considering how lovely Daphne is. Dr. Patel's bio on the site needs changed as he does not listen to his patients and does not have a holistic approach. Period.|My pain Dr. Changed careers so I went to this place and saw Dr. Kieber. He was going to totally change my pain meds. To something weaker and would not give me my usual muscle relaxers, I quizzed him a bit about all of my serious conditions and he didn't  answer?! Only then did he start looking at all of the pages of my bad health!?  He made this decision without knowing anything about me!  I said this won't work  coming here. So he wrote me a two week prescription of my usual pain meds until I find a real place that treats pain.  By the way he struggled to figure how many pills it would be for two weeks.  I knew the answer right away it's 84 pills.  He finally came up with 75 pills (wrong)  I just shook my head and excepted his number.  His name is Dr. Alexander Kieber.....place is a joke|Was a wonderful experience start to finish.   From office staff to nurse practitioner to Dr Hutchinson.   My first time going.  I was nervous.  Didn't know what to expect.   Was  refreshing how great they all were.|Been very happy with this office. I first brought my
Mom for treatment and so so pleased with how she was treated by everyone I go there now as well.|I love CPM, My Dr.Hutchinson is great. Christina is the best she listens and cares. Chrisy and Ashley are very helpful at the front desk. I am constantly in pain and they are helping me all the time.|First it should not take more than 15 minutes to get demographic and health history information. I was on the phone with them for almost 40 minutes for the first call. The document I got sent to sign for new patient paperwork was all wrong.  The big things being that they had another patient's birthday, phone number, and address on my paperwork. I called the office and they had the person call me back to fix it. The next document was also wrong. I called the office a couple more times before, finally they sent me a correct document on like the 4th document that they sent me. 3 hours later they finally had my demographics and healthcare information and a correct new patient document.

Next issue, the person on the phone confirmed my appointment for 1pm. I was there for 1pm, then they told me I was 30 minutes late. Then, why not tell me the appointment time is for 12:30. I wouldn't have been able to make it for 12:30. When they called to book my appointment I stated I'm very busy with a lot of appointments and such.

Final issue is that they gave me the wrong address to go to.

This has been my worst experience with any healthcare office and I've lived all over the country.|Worst place, they state it's illegal to use personal health insurance for a motor vehicle crash which is absolutely false. You can use your personal health insurance for vehicle crashes, so don't let these uppity office managers tell you different. They wouldn't allow me to go back to the room with my wife because the room was to small which is a lie, they let another man go back with his wife but not me. When I called them out on it they doubled down saying the room was to small which was false. The nurse couldn't read a height and weight machine. So now my wife is still in pain, they refused to do nerve mapping and bill our insurance so we are back at square one.

Donna|I have been seeing these doctors for over 6 years and they are all wonderful! The assistants and office staff are so kind and helpful! I wouldn't trust anyone else with my care!|AMAZING STAFF, AMAZING DOCTORS!
My first impression was out of this world! Dr. OQuinn was highly efficient in diagnosing a painful issue I've been dealing with for 7 months! He scheduled testing and I finally felt HEARD! He knew the language and he asked me specific questions to understand!

Then when I was checking out, Krista was handling incoming patients, setting appointments for outgoing patients, speaking LOUD AND CLEAR for a hard of hearing patient, she answered my questions on paperwork and even assisted with a urine sample for a patient that had to relieve themselves before their appt.

Krista clearly is cross trained to work as an air traffic controller ANNND her tone was so friendly and bubbly, I thought she was going to offer me an Apple Pie and a rocking chair! This organization is the Chick-Fil-A of Spine and Pain management!

10/10 recommend, do not waste anymore time, go get your life back!|Was referred to this site by my doctor. He said to call to insure order. When I did so the girl who takes appointments was rude and said that's not how it works and my doctor should know better. I waited a week and called back to find out status of order. At this point it was clear the girl, same as previously, had no interest and seemed to be annoyed by my attempt for information. At the end of conversation she thought she hung up the phone but she was wrong. I listen on as she spoke to another colleague of hers about me using foul language. Bottom line ridiculous, unprofessional, and unacceptable to anyone. When my order is confirmed I will be making a move.|Staff is wonderful, everything is like clockwork. No long waits.

thought after expressing my concerns to
the office manager, i would be treated differently, but i feel lied to and discriminated against. pain management isn't worth how they treated me. stay far away.|8/23/24 I was a patient of Dr. Jonathan Gardner at the Pain Institute of Charleston in West Ashley in January 2024. During that time, I followed the required process: an initial appointment, an epidural, and a post-epidural appointment. I made sure to attend the post-epidural appointment, despite feeling great, in case I needed to see Dr. Gardner again in the future.

Unfortunately, in July, my back issues returned. I received a letter stating that Dr. Gardner had moved to the Carolina Pain Institute in Ladson. I immediately contacted the new office, only to be told that the office manager, who is the sole person responsible for transferring patients from the old system to the new one, was out for the week. I was advised to wait for her return.

I followed up after a week, only to be told that I needed to ""wait my turn."" It has now been three weeks, and I have yet to receive a callback. I am in extreme pain and am beyond frustrated with the lack of urgency and care from Carolina Pain Institute. I was a loyal patient of Dr. Gardner, willing to drive to Ladson to continue under his care, but it seems that the Carolina Pain Institute is not interested in accommodating his previous patients.

This level of unresponsiveness and lack of concern for a patient's well-being is unacceptable. I urge Carolina Pain Institute to address this issue immediately, as this experience has been nothing short of disappointing and frustrating.

10/23/24: 2 months have gone by and I still have not heard from this office. I have moved on but at this point as a new patient or existing, I would seriously consider taking your business elsewhere. I do feel justified because all of the reviews since I've written in have also been negative. Glad I didn't trek out to Ladson for this when there are many more great doctors in Charleston.|I had a terrible experience with Dr. Gardner.

I saw another patient mention on the review when she walked in the lady at the front desk said we don't do pain medication, and I totally relate. The doctor didn't even bother to examine my wrist before jumping straight to conclusions. He insisted that I was too young for pain medication and needed more surgery, despite me explaining that I've already undergone seven surgeries and am desperate to avoid any further procedures.

Then, in the midst of our conversation, he pivoted to talking about cars! I tried to express my concerns as a Black woman about how we often feel overlooked when it comes to our health and mental wellbeing. Sadly, instead of understanding, his response was dismissive: ""We're not playing the racist card here."" I can't believe he would compare me to a car!

When I first met Sir Riber he was patient and answered all of the questions I had even drawing a diagram to help explain it to me. But seeing his PA and trying to speak to someone on the phone to handle my husband's appointment and billing has been a complete nightmare!! They never answer the phone no matter how many messages you leave, nor answer web messages sent via the portal. I am still trying to understand why my husband has a bill on a date that we had paid in advance and at the time of the visit for a week now! This is insane! Oh and the 3 stars is also due to them being professional and pleasant while there. They just need to work on their back office staff a bit or hire some new staff.|Dr. Riber is hands down the best Dr in the world. He is kind, reassuring, and very understanding and knowledgeable. I literally love this man! My first initial visit I felt Dr. Ribers passion for his work. He took the time to listen to me and my concerns. He explained everything to me like no other doctor has. I left that day feeling more confident then ever that I was on my way to recovery.When my second appointment was scheduled I was scared and a little nervous but I knew I was in good hands. Dr. Riber came in the room with plenty of smiles and humor to calm my nerves. When I tell you he walked me thru my whole procedure and made sure I was comfortable and felt no pain. My God Dr.Riber is heaven sent. After my procedure I literally shed a tear because Dr. Riber is so amazing and I couldn't thank him enough.If you are ever looking for a pain management physician office don't cheat your self, treat your self to his office. 10/10 highly recommend!|I wrote a review earlier but it disappeared for some reason, so here goes try #2.  I can say without a doubt that of the 4 pain management doctors I have seen throughout my military career, Dr Riber is far and away the best.  He was kind, compassionate, and took time to listen and understand what I was telling him.  I have a condition that will never go away, but he has taken every step he could to ensure that I am as comfortable as possible, and can function on a normal basis.  His staff has been nothing friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this practice to anyone.  Thank you Dr Riber!|DR.Riber as well as the other Dr's and P.A.s nurses and staff are THE BEST in SC. I feel truly blessed to have these Drs.taking care of all my pains and doing all they can to relieving my pain to give me a better quality of life.Thank you to all of yall !!|I don't see Dr. Reiber I see the other Dr. She is very professional, appears to have compassion and understanding for those of us whose lives have been impacted by pain. I need the stimulator and honestly it isn't the Dr. But the staff that are the turn off point for me. They seem young, unorganized, and slightly dysfunctional from the one time I was there to now trying to get an appointment scheduled. Communication is weak and no one seems to really know or keep you in the loop. I was seen 4 months ago and still i don't have an appointment for the stimulator.  Its very aggravating when you pay over 500 dollars a month for insurance because I was laid off most likely due to my pain and back issues and your plea for help per say takes a back burner. I think although someone specializes in something doesn't mean they understand the real struggle we face. My life has been forever changed and living day to day at times feels hopeless. Don't forget the type of people you are dealing with, at least not the honest ones who just want help and a better quality of life.|I have Lupus, osteoarthritis in every joint(stage 3) endometriosis, fibromyalgia, tumors. I went to this pain ""Managment"" for 7 months. I was given the minimum amount of pain medication. And ended up finding out my body doesn't respond well to it. I tried EVERY medication that wasn't an opioid, and had Terrifying side effects. But when I refused to do another experimental medicine, they couldn't help me further. Because they ""don't believe in using opioids to help treat pain."" They make you feel like your a problem if you don't respond to their non opioid medicine too. You will be urine tested more than Actual drug addicts as well. When I left there, I felt helpless and more alone with my pain than Ever. Please save yourself the emotional pain.|This is my second time sitting in this office and both times have been unpleasant. Even my previous experiences by phone have been horrible and that's if they even answer or bother to return our calls. We arrive to the appointment 15 minutes early. Now here it is 40 minutes past the time of the appointment and we're still sitting here. What's the point in scheduling if we aren't going to be seen around our scheduled time? Yet you want to charge us if we reschedule too late or if we show up late. If it were up to me we would've been moved on to a different doctor. Unfortunately my client is happy with Dr. Reiber so here we may stay.|Dr Stanislause has been understanding and compassionate.  My PA is very smart and always answers my questions and always just seems to be really concerned about my wellness in general. I have been a patient for a few years now and am more than satisfied.

He listens to his patients.
I've been with him for years.
Thank you so very much for listening to my concerns and taking such good care of me
Susan Sellers Johnson|Dr Boatwright is warm, kind, caring and compassionate. He truly listens and has a genuine understanding of pain and a sincere desire to help his patients live more comfortably. All this is also reflected in all his staff who exemplify these same wonderful traits. We truly respect and appreciate Dr Boatwright and his entire team.  We highly recommend this practice.|Went for consultation with Dr Boatwright for the first time today. His staff was very friendly and welcoming. I am very pleased with the care given today. He took the time to get to know me and learn my needs. Even shared his life story with me. Literally sat and talked to me for 45 minutes. I felt a connection with him instantly. I look forward to being his patient. Thank you Dr Boatwright for caring it seriously means a lot.|Dr. Boatwright is amazing! My husband and I have been going to him for over four years.  He and his staff are the absolute best we have ever found in alleviating our pains. Dr. Boatwright is very professional, extremely passionate and a caring provider. He truly works wonders for us. You won't find a more caring doctor anywhere. We highly recommend him.|What a wonderful caring doctor with a great staff. Gives you the time you need and wants to help you as much as he could. Respect his time with you as you have to respect his time with others. Wish I was his patient years ago when I got hurt.|The are always patient and actually listen. The office is clean and the office staff is pleasant. Thank you.|This so called doctor treated me for back and neck pain. I paid my co-pay each time I visited his office. After no longer using his practice to manage my pain I received a bill for approximately $450. I called to find out what this bill was for and I was told his previous billing firm was not very good and the company I was speaking with was NEW. When I asked for a detailed invoice so I could pay the ""bill"" I was told they did not have ANY backup from the previous agency so the current recievable firm could not provide a detailed invoice. Next I find he sent my account to a collection agency. I then called again and this time told that again another NEW company was handling his billing but again no one could provide me with ANY detailed invoice - they simply said ""I OWE $450 with no backup). It is now 6+ years, my credit has gone down due to his lack of hiring a professional accounting firm and recently I find he sent my account to a new collection firm so this negative comment hurts my credit and apparently will never end (even though it should have ended a couple of years ago - it appears this bogus ""bill"" will never go away and has increased to $750 ----- EVEN THOUGH HE HAS NO BACKUP TO PROVIDE ME SO I COULD PAY THE BILL IF I FOUND IT TO BE CORRECT (I know I paid my copay each and every time I meet with Boatright.) As all can see his billing has messed my credit (not by much since I had an 800+ credit rating before his sending these made-up bills to collection.---- like anyone would do I did not and will not pay this bill since it is not something I owe!!!
As a ""pain specialist"" he rates a ""0"" in my book and I would NEVER RECOMMEND his practice - I instead have found a professional pain management firm that has now provided facite injections, ablation and epideral injections RATHER THAN ADDICTIVE PAIN MEDS!!!
Thankfully I have found appropriate physicians in the area - I personally feel Boatright is someone who found a great way to use his medical training to increase his fortune by providing addictive medications rather than find solutions to an individuals pain related problems.|I saw Dr Boatwright for the chronic pain in my lower back, right hip and leg. He gave me shots in my back but I didn't get any relief. On my last visit 8/8/19 I went in to get my prescription of 100mg daily changed to 150mg twice daily.  I called and asked the office personal if they could ask to make sure if I brought in my prescription of 100mg I could turn it in and get a prescription for 150mg twice daily and I was told yes.  I asked please could you ask again and make sure because I didn't want to drive 60 miles for nothing.  I was told no it's ok.  When I went in for my appointment 8/8/19 and saw Kerri Frey PA she said she didn't know anything about it and she couldn't do anything about it. I told her that is what I had been told 3 different times and she said I don't know why they would say that. She said I didn't write it so she couldn't do it I had to go back to my PCP.  I told her I was upset because I was expecting to get it taken care of and now  I wasted my time and hers. And, I was upset due to being in pain for more than 3 month without pain relief. The nurse came in and tried to help stating I would have to wait 3 months because the prescription had already been shipped and to come in and then they would be able to write a new one.  When I got to my appointment 10/14/19 I was told my appointment had been cancelled and I had been discharged because Kerri did not like negative comments I made about the office.  I don't think the Doctor had anything to do with it, I could be wrong.",2025-01-10|2024-08-14|2023-12-05|2023-10-12|2023-12-27|2024-12-19|2022-04-26|2019-10-15,5|5|5|5|5|5|1|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJLxdc-3xqAIkRMSUX-UiZfPg,30

They don't help for chronic pain. Dr Delorey was terrible to see. We fired each other. What I see, no one in that pain medicine facility, helps with pain. I live in miserable pain constantly. My Dr can prescribe what I was given. Gabapentin and cymbalta. Really all for nerve pain and 3 depression meds. 2 depression meds were from my primary Dr. This place isn't worth our time or effort. For no help. Looks like all Dr here I've researched, none help. In Las Vegas my pain mgmt. Helped me I had some more quality of life. Because they manage your pain. No problems, these doctors here, don't care!|My grandmother came in to see Dr Joshua Smith. Her appointment was at 10:30. She arrived at 10:29. The receptionist said that she was late because she had paperwork that she had to fill out. They let her fill it out and it took her 6 minutes. They let my grandmother wait and wait and then told her that if someone didn't show up then they would see her. They said they would even allow that person to be late. That is absurd when considering what they were putting my grandmother through. The people did show up and they sent my grandmother home without treating her. My grandmother is about to be 90, she has 3 vertebrae in her back that are completely done for, she is to fragile to undergo that surgery but was able to undergo a different surgery 2 weeks ago to repair her fractured hip. Obviously when someone has been through something like that there should be a little bit of leniency. These are supposedly medical professionals. Someone who is recovering from hip surgery amongst several other things are slow to move around and hard to get into vehicles. My grandmother has been in bed the past month in so much pain she can hardly leave her room let alone the house. Now she has to go so much longer feeling like this. I am completely disgusted with the way she was treated and hope nobody ever gets treated like this again.|My wife and I have been going to this location for over 2 years.  We would normally see Dr J. Smith.  Dr. Smith, I would consider, a perfect Dr. as he would first ask the patient how they are.
My wife has extreme pain all the time.  She cries because the pain is all encompassing for her.  Unfortunately she couldn't see Dr Smith - a busy man.  We had to settle for his associate PA Carlos Arturo Aries.  He knows my wife is in extreme pain, but he was only concerned about her falling down.
She has late stage Alzheimers, what did he except.
He did not listen to either of us about her issue.  When he did listen he became confrontational and stayed that way until we ""fired him"".  To make it worse, some of his staff was also confrontational toward us.  They must hang around Carlos too much.
When we told him we would be looking for a new Pain Practice, all he said was, ""That's your right"".
If you must go to this practice, ONLY see Dr. Smith.  He has the 'bed side manner' of what you'd expect from a caring DR.  DO NOT GO TO HIS PA.  If you think I'm making this up, give PA Aries a try but don't expect too much.  (just some friendly advice and this is only my opinion)|Terrible place. My Dr sent a referral. They never called. When I called them they transferred me to another location but told me they were waiting on prior authorization. I left a message and nobody returned my call. My insurance company told me they did not have any pending authorizations. Called back a week later and left another message. What an incompetent place. My dr even called over and they got same run around. Clearly they don't want business. I see a whole lot of people here had same terrible service. I wish they would get shutdown. I received a referral to another dr and they called me same day and got me scheduled. Bye bye Felicia.|Horrible experience. I have a nerve disease and lived in pain for 2 years. Dr wants to give me meds that do not even effect nerve pain. Staff is very rude and will be searching for a different Dr who cares and can actually help me. Do not go here.|Very unprofessional in their tone and how they deal with people who actually are in need of their help. Requested a conversation for the MD to speak to me about my upcoming surgery and was told he doesn't have time ever to take a quick phone call that I need to schedule an in-house appointment to give him this information so I could spend more money on a specialist Visit. The nurse was very short and acted as if I was bothering them to update them on my condition that they sent me out to get looked at by another physician. It's all a money/insurance game and the art of customer service is far beyond reach.|The assistant ""Carlos"" Told me that the reason I couldn't find pain relief was because it was all in my head! I have never been so furious before! No One has ever said that to me as all my diagnoses obviously are what I suffer with.
I tried to give myself time to breathe from how mad and hurt his words at my appointment made me. But I can't get over the fact that he falsely and rudely decided that my pain is in my head, as he said 4 times in the appointment. I have suffered extremely horribly and cruelly for 15 years with constant and severe pain most of my life. I have been to therapists who all said I handle my pain incredibly and with good cheer and that is to be commended because it is VERY hard to stay positive when anyone has level 10 pain for 6 years.

ANY sane person would be cracking now no thanks to the 0 help I have gotten with this whole medical area! Everything I brought up to them they said wouldn't be a problem but it was. And the medicine they thought wouldn't help me DID
I have lost out on lots of good things these past 4 months with no real help and HUGE bills from appointments and this pain medicine they put me on with no other option. All I want is to get better but since it isn't in my head i can't since this facility doesn't seem to want to try to help me manage my pain as is THEIR job calling.|I did not feel heard at all, and was treated like another customer being sold goods instead of a person coming for compassionate health care.
I was rescheduled for my first appointment because I was 15 minutes early instead of 30 minutes early. The gps routed us to the wrong location. We called as soon as we knew the error which was 35 minutes before the appointment time, and we gave eta and new routing information to the receptionist. Instead of telling us over the phone to reschedule, they waited till we arrived. For a pain prevention care facility, seems like consideration, and compassionate decision making would be paramount. However, filling out paperwork is essential to treatment with them even though most of the questions asked in the paperwork was asked by the nurse and doctor.
Dr. Math was cold and insensitive. My mother was with me, and agreed that she made her feel uncomfortable.
It is very apparent to us that there is a money grab.
My family has not had great service from GHS as a whole, sadly to say.
I really hate to give bad reviews, but I think this place should be avoided.",2024-03-28|2023-04-21|2023-10-03|2023-09-07|2024-05-29|2023-03-14|2022-06-10|2018-08-10,1|1|1|1|1|2|1|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|2 p.m.",66.2|64.2|54.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|physical_therapy|rude_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJcYxoWOkuWIgRz5hfMUyOraE,35

This went on for 30 minutes when finally the PA told me and the one other waiting patient that they could not find keys to the medical equipment room where EMG machine was located. 30 minutes later same PA offered to reschedule both of us; we both declined. Waiting room is uncomfortable, especially for those with spine problems and probably other conditions. Bathroom is yuuuuuck. When I finally saw Dr. Stickler he was kind and professional. He thanked me for my patience. I couldn't help but feel the test was done in haste, but he is supposed to be the best so I am telling myself he is able to work quickly and competently. He told me my results would be sent to my physician's office in a week. Today, January 13, 2025, it has been 19 days and results are not ready. Subtracting weekend days and one holiday it has still been 12 days since my EMG was performed. I was told my ordering physician would receive the EMG results in about a week. Previously, at university hospital Augusta and at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville FLA , results were available within a day. I am ready to call my insurance company to see if test can be performed locally so that I may get results that are timely and accurate.|I would give this clinic a lower rating if at all possible. I called them weeks ago to try and get medication issues resolved but was unable to recieve a call back or hear anything from the providers there. That was until today over a full month later. This is after having tricare cancel the referral do to insufficient level of care, and having a whole new referral set in place. What an absolute terrible practice they run here and I'm sorry for anyone they treat.|People in these reviews are completely opposite of my experiences. They work well, quick. Deal with all my questions.
People have to give some slack because you're working two offices all week.
I 100% would recommend|I have been coming to this clinic for years and have always received great care. Dr. Drakeley and his staff are the best!|If I could give them zero stars I would. For starters they never answer their phones. They don't send out appointment reminders nor emails. Overall I shouldn't have to go to a hospital for treatments for my migraines if I have a whole doctor for that but unfortunately they again don't answer the phones. You can leave messages voicemails and emails, unfortunately whoever is in that office doesn't care about patients nor the practice. With their Botox treatments they don't use any type of lidocaine or numbing cream which you would think would be considered maltreatment due to purposely inflicting pain on your patient when they have other alternatives to make it a slightly more comfortable process. During my first session I was told I did better than most due to her being kicked and or cussed out during the procedure. Why as a pain specialist/neurologist office do you all not offer an easier treatment for your patients. Overall this is one of the worst places to go too for any type of medical needs that I have ever went to in my life. Hopefully this office gets new management or something because the way this establishment has been running the past year I have been a patient is atrocious. The only reason it took me so long to transfer doctors is because the hoops I've had to jump through just to get approved for Botox since again the office sucks at any type of communication or corresponding. Why did the Botox company I was receiving vials from call me trying to reach the office for months to establish why they haven't received the appropriate documents they needed from the office . I should not miss work for a whole week if again I've been going to a specialist for almost two years to try and find some type of relief from persistent migraines. Please rethink getting seen or serviced at this office if you're actually trying to find some relief.|I have had several run ins with this office. First the office is horrible with answering the phone! It doesn't matter if it's two offices or not handling the calls they should pick up. It was one time I called 22x for them to answer as I was out of town for longer than expected and out of medicine. Second I'm  the first patient with this doctor to get the VNS surgery and can't get my device turned on because of insurance issues. It's unbelievable that I have a device in my body with no way to turn it on. There should be someway this could be worked out. But again no one will pick up the phone. The only way to get a response is to leave the negative reviews I guess. But then again all the negative reviews have the same response.|This practice is horrible. I've been a patient for almost 2 years and have had several issues. The only reason I haven't left yet is because there are not many other Neurologist in the Columbia sc area.  I waited several months to receive my medication (copaxon) and after calling them weekly they finally sent the pharmacist what they requested to fill the order. Also, AOPI sent them a letter of medical necessity in order for me to order a brace for my foot drop but they can't give it to me until the PA has the dr to complete the form and send it back to them. Ive been waiting almost 2 weeks now. The biggest issue ive had out of them is Social Security requested medical records and they were the only practice out of 3 that have not sent the records. The records were requested 3 months ago. They didn't send them until I called and complain. They never answer the phone in the Columbia location. I always have to call Charleston to get them to give them my messages. I can tell its not just patients that have a problem with them. I think the staff has issues because every time I visit i see new staff. Do not use these people!!!!|If possible, I'd leave these folks a negative star rating. Any Star Wars fans out there? ""You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy,"" comes to mind. If you want a doctor's office that's pockets are lined with big corporations money to help protect them, instead of actually caring or attempting to help their clients, then you've found the right place. A close family friend has been having to fight with these ""doctors"" for about a year now, and in spite of his clear and present issues (as indicated by several MRI's, and other actual medical professionals), as well as verbally explaining the amount of pain he's in, they have yet to offer him ANY viable form of pain management.",2025-01-07|2024-05-30|2024-04-02|2024-10-14|2024-01-24|2023-08-10|2023-03-06|2023-08-15,2|1|4|5|1|1|1|1,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|10 a.m.",42.6|42.4|38.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJKV8D_-mv-IgRwfEmCuLsgYk,52

Referred a several days ago. I have continuously been in touch with the referring office. When I tried to be proactive the first date, ""Melissa"", the coordinator, gave me a ""courtesy call"" so she can say she called me back, but just to tell me the referral hasn't been received yet, and ""as her voicemail recording states, SHE will call once it is received"" basically. I gave it 48 hours, followed up again and now she claims to not have received the referral at all. I have done my part to follow up, even offered to send the referral myself so I don't have to keep communicating back and forth between offices. She wouldn't accept it. I tried to ask for the Fax number directly to make sure that it was sent to the right place. She refused to give it to me also. She wanted me to call the referring office and have them call her directly. The patient has been in pain this entire time while we are waiting to be scheduled. I cannot wait any longer, We will just go somewhere else if it is this hard to advocate to get an appointment. Extremely Rude every single interaction.|It's difficult to assign a rating to this practice. The doctors seem attentive and effectively deal with most of my issues. I'm 80+ and have had a pretty good amount of experience dealing with medical services, that said I've never come across a group with less attention to communication than here. Countless messages that have never been addressed, and no, I'm not pestering them for pain refills. Emails never acknowledged. There is no patient portal that I can find and I've been trying to access my medical records to no avail, they screen all calls and direct them to mailboxes that apparently are never accessed  by doctors or PAs. I guarantee they will drive you crazy.|My experience here has been great over the 10+ years I've been a patient.  People tend to be angry when they arrive at the place because they're in pain.  I have a bulging disc for which I've been getting epidural injections for years. The treatments allow me to live a normal productive life.  The staff have always been professional and helpful.  Like most medical offices they are busy managing the ridiculous amount of paperwork required by the frigging insurance industry who are the true villains our society .  I've had a great experience.|I didn't even become a patient here and it was the worst experience I've ever encountered. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and moved to SC. I was seeing pain management for years in WA state for CRPS, HEDS, a spinal cord stimulator & multiple rib surgeries. I received paperwork from this office to request records from my previous pain clinic and mailed them back. I called the office 2-3 weeks later just to follow up & ensure they received those for a new patient appointment. I spoke with Melinda and upon answering the she went into a monologue about how many documents could be received, what cannot be reviewed, the doctors are very busy and can't look at too much. Literally was not why I was calling. When I clarified why I was calling she gave a very heavy sigh and went into how that wasn't her job and reiterated how busy they are. I'm a nurse, I work closely with our referrals department at times and appreciate how busy they are, as am I as a nurse. However, I have NEVER treated a patient like this before. I told her I could sense some frustration and how I understand but it was not ok to speak to me like this. I eventually hung up the call as I do not HAVE to be a patient at their facility. She tried calling back two times but never left a VM. I guess if this office is so busy then she's doing a great job deterring new patients.|Was referred to this pain management through the VA. The doctor I was seeing was nice. I was sent to have an MRI done, it took me from Oct 9-Nov 11 to get the MRI approved, because this office did not read the packet the VA sent. I had to call the pain management group to tell them how to do their job. From Nov 11- present no one will return my call or answer the phone. Once I called they said the individual was on the phone and to leave a message, so I did, still no call back. If you are referred to them, RUN.|Was referred due to having RA @ 34 multiple cervical fusions and lower back pain and needed medication management and second opinion. Was never called and told nothing else could be done for me I guess when trying to find someone to help you and have a second opinion pain Management denies you if your young and not within there papered notes so Instead of investigating looking at the patient you turn them away and don't even respond to them then when they call tirelessly then your Melinda lady is nasty when you ask a simple question and she responds it's his office he can chose who he wants and who he doesn't it he reads your chart notes from the prior pain clinic..... that's the clinic me and surgeon wanted a second opinion from. Well he can't do and feel he can't help you anymore than what's been done. Really there's been no imaging of my lower back no nerve testing of my lower back no pain control medication adjustment or anything after my surgery except from my surgeon. So he could he chooses not to. I honestly don't even want medications I want a treatment plan that works and one doctors that has control of all my medications like it's supposed to be. I get Melinda but your nasty attitude towards kind people you should really feel ashamed when you go home at night to talk to people that way that are in pain left in the dark and thrown around like a freaking ping pong ball. And all they want is 5 min and someone to help them and if they can't at least be kind. I'm glad I bit the bullet on this Office understand the hesitancy behind Pain Management, especially with the current pandemic and opioids but you're also doctors who took the oats to help patient in pain at your job, quit looking at a chart and papers that other doctors wrote on bring patients in and look at them for yourself listen to them see what's wrong with them. That's what a second opinion is not going based on what a chart says. Then, if you feel they are not a good fit for your office dismiss them explain to them I cannot help you, but if you go back to this doctor, he will or let me point you in this direction but doing it in this manner is just wrong that's why we have a problem that we have. Well, Melinda, I hope you have a wonderful day and I truly mean that because I do know how stressful your job is, but I truly hope you're nicer to the next person than you were to me.|My name is Patty Patty Arnold. I've been going to Dr. Lower milk for over 15 years. He and his staff are very kind and professional to me. Dr Loudermilk does not give pain medication unless it is absolutely necessary. He is a brilliant Doctor and Anesthesiologist. I have been reading his reviews there not very kind  I don't understand because there have never been unkind to me. Sometimes we need to understand our Dood stress and pressure and sometimes maybe they can't be 100 percent the way we want to be.

The first thing I noticed was the office was filthy. Dust on the floors and furniture. There was a wad of gum on the floor that looked ancient. No one weighed me or checked my vital signs. A man, who I assumed was the doctor, led me to a room where he began telling me how he ""planned to treat me"". I had many questions- have you reviewed my medications? Do you know my diagnosis? He became frustrated and spat out, ""I can see you're going to be a problem!"". He then told me ""if you act like this- the doctor will end this. It will be OVER!"".
I thought this guy WAS the doctor. A moment later the actual doctor arrived. He expressed his disapproval of how I questioned his ""X-ray tech"" and then said, ""I'm not doing this. Find someone else to treat your pain"".
What? My wife was there with me. Neither of us could believe what had just happened. Before the doctor stormed out of the room I asked him if I would be charged for this ""visit"". He bluntly said ""yes you are"". I wonder how Medicare would react to these clowns charging for nothing? I would report these unprofessional children but then I will have to pay out of pocket.
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go here. Drive to Columbia or Charleston and see a real professional group. I suggest Midland Orthopedics. Nice office- good people and outstanding treatment.|I came in as a new patient today. The Dr walked in and DEMANDED I take my Trump hat off because he was offended. When I refused, he didn't even examine me and told me he wouldn't help me and I need to go somewhere else. Now I'm still in massive pain because he wants to play politics with my health.|This place is horrible. The doctor is obnoxious and rude. I scheduled appointment only to get shots in my knees. The doctor came in and was not prepared to do any shots, but rather try and address my medicines that I'm on. I got up and told him I'm not here for medicines, I'm here for shots in my knees and I walked out.|Avoid this place at all costs. After seeing them for almost a year they have done nothing except violate my hippa rights then when I called them out on it they tried to make me leave saying I obviously think they are doing a bad job (they were never once in an 8 month stretch did they call in the meds.correctly or on time) when I didn't leave I was dismissed with an 8 day notice to my next appointment. They provided no referral to another doctor or adequate time to find another doctor which is against the law when they have you on opioids. So if you want your private information shared with strangers online and want nothing more then a pill pusher this is the place for you. I will be filing a complaint to medical board  and seeing an attorney about the 8 day notice of the dismissal too.

And I am well aware you can not confirm or deny I am a patient because that would be another Hippa violation and I am sure one per patient is your limit.|Our appointment was for 1:40 it's now 3:40 and we still haven't seen the doctor. This is ridiculous!|They say when first coming here their plan is for No meds & no pain. Didn't realize they meant that they would not call in meds every single month, with repeat unanswered phone calls and not submitting documents on time with the insurance company for pre authorization. Causing weeks with no pain medication at all and you can not get the nurses to answer the line or call back. Do not recommend if you are in chronic pain and can not go without medication for weeks every single visit. When they do what they are supposed to, the clinic works smoothly, but that has only happened once or twice in a year.|This is a very busy and crowded facility, but they do their best to get  you in and out. The doctors are awesome .Just go in sign in, don't leave because if you are not in their they will replace your spot. They don't have  time to call your  name over and over.

I met with Dr. Hewan-lowe and her first question to me was, ""what makes you think these are migraines?"" Well after 100's of doctors visit from the past 25 years for migraines pretty much let's me know, I have 2 types of migraines- cluster and tension. I was referred to PM for treatment for SC spine due to my ongoing pain.
My appt was at 1230, she walked in 5 after 1 and (HAD NOT READ ANY OF MY MEDICAL HISTORY NOTES TO PREPARE FOR MY APPTS)  to even begin to familiarize herself with my extensive documented medical records.
SHE MESSED UP MY PRESCRIPTIONS by forgetting to send one over and the other one was an entirely different muscle relaxer that makes me drowsy. Dr Hewan-low would not let me finish a sentence when asking me medical history questions, claiming she has ""other patients"" that deserve their time as well.
An absolute disgrace and waste of 2 months waiting for her to treat you like a piece of paper she can simply write off. I would not recommend this place to anyone I cared about. She even told me she wasn't doing my normal Botox injections for migraines when everyone was hyping the Self regional Pain management up like yeah they can do a ALL the injections but THAT WAS FALSE, ANDERSON IS THE NEXT CLOSET PLACE FOR HELP, don't waste your time waiting on Dr Huwan-lowe|The place sucks. They need to close the doors. Been going here over a year now and still have not received any help. You can't get anyone to answer the phone and when you do you can't get an appointment for at least another month or two.

They must make a lot of money from the injections because they try to force that on you as your only option. The doctor (LaTourette) has no bedside manner or personality and doesn't seem to care about proper patient care. Will be filing a complaint with the medical board and definitely NEVER going back.|My experience with pain management  is a good working relationship. You have to put in the work, follow advice, etc.

Update: After going to pain management for a year, getting injections, pain medication,  I was told I could no longer get pain meds due to an ""anxiety medication"" I had been taking for years, and was on my chart.

They, in turn, prescribed liquid cough suppressant for me, a person with COPD.

Thank you guys for continuing to be the best!!!|The Providers and Staff are professional, thorough and understanding, in all aspects. Most imperative, they genuinely care. I definitely recommend them, for they go above and beyond for the quality of ones healthcare.|Had a good doctor who understood my pain at 1st then she moved to another practice and all of a sudden I was discharged because I was out of town with my father for his surgery to remove his kidney because of cancer when they wanted me to come in for a random count! Waist of time! Please look for another practice! This one will waist your time!!|I have lifelong chronic conditions and don't agree with opioid use until I've exhausted ALL options. I had a reaction to one medicine and then I was unknowingly prescribed an opioid. When I expressed being uncomfortable with taking an opiod 2x a day EVERY day the doctor refused to see me after I came to my appt. She did say I wasn't charged but I was off the schedule until I talked to my therapist about taking the opioid. The MA (medical assistant) advised that what i was prescribed is a ""baby opiod"" opioid is opioid. Period. The MA also said that they are a pain management office so their job is to push pills. Uh no. I'm lucky to have found another pain management physician who is offering pain management that does not involve risk of addiction with long term use since I have LIFELONG conditions. I can never support someone who refuses to listen to their patients and pushes pills such as opioids and refuses to care for a patient because they want alternatives to opioids.|Updated 02/04/2025 Dr Lisa and her staff left the office, now they're new doctors and new staff. Let's just say It is no longer a 5 star experience. This office cannot keep good doctors.

Dr. Lisa and her team are such great people. They are friendly, kind and well educated. They ask that you arrive 15 mins before your appointment. I have always been inside the exam room before my scheduled time (even during this pandemic). Dr. Lisa has always took the time to listen me. She has done everything possible to manage my pain, which has included sending me to other doctors. My appointments have never taken longer than an hour, normally it takes longer for me to get to her office than to see her and be headed home.|I absolutely love this place. My doctor is the best. She listens and she cares! Everyone at this practice are amazing! From the front to the back.

They listen and work with me on treatment plans, and test ,xray,mri what ever they recommend. Coming here they help me have a better quality of life.

She is very polite, professional, and extremely helpful.

Her service is much appreciated.

Thank you for your kindness & flexibility, Katie 

I recommend a raise to her upper management because she's a major asset to Trident, and she's on the front lines for the company.

Katie makes patients feel appreciated and loved on a consistent basis because she sincerely cares.

Respectfully,
Noah Denton|It's fine to sign up here, but be aware you will be treated like a criminal, not a patient. In 6 months, I had two false positive tests. The first they said ""don't do it again"" to which I asked ""how?"" and the second they kicked me out via phone call. Unfortunately, clinics like this mistreat those legitimately suffering from chronic pain. Rather than serving their patients, they directly create demand for black market alternatives. After a year here, I can tell you they will guaranteed do the same to you and with a smile on their face.

I have no criminal history or past with drugs. Just a guy who legitimately needs pain medicine and is now guaranteed not to get it. Be aware that signing up here will have consequences, false positives will eventually happen, and there will be no re-test or reprimand of any kind. There is no pain treatment in 2024.|Wonderful Doctor's and PA'S. I had to go to a different pain management because of insurance reasons, and after a year I switched insurance so I could go back to them. Trident Pain is by far the best for Pain management. You will not be disappointed if you choose them to assist with your care. They actually listen and educate you as needed, promotes natural medicine and prescription, do research and stay educated on current health information, and most of all they actually care.|We were seen on 8/23 and had a horrible visit as a new patient just left for 45 minutes sitting in the room waiting to be seen and when I said something I was told that new patients could take an hour or more, ok but not an hour sitting in a room waiting to be seen!!!  Then we were told that the treatment we were looking into had to have prior authorization and that it could take up to 7 business days, well its now been 11 business days so I call the office only to find out that the doctor never made or sent a note for the prior authorization to be processed!  I do not have time to waste with doctors offices that cannot follow through and will never be back to this office, or any other location for that matter, it just is unacceptable to treat new patients in pain this way when there are so many other options out there.|The Doctors and their staff are amazing! I was very scared when I first moved to the area, thinking I wouldn't find anyone to help me and continuing my care when I left the North East.  I was very pleasantly put at ease when I made my first appointment.  They are caring, compassionate, and thorough! I am so happy that I found this group, and I thank them for all they do.|Had an appointment here for 2:30. I was told to get there a half hour early. Get there at 1:50 and wasn't seen until 2:45. I was in a car accident, and it is hard for me to sit long periods of time. So I wasn't very happy sitting there for an hour and have 2 MRIs done, back to back. So I was in a lot of pain, and honestly, no one at the counter cared at all. I know people have bad days, but some compassion goes a Long way!|HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! I should have taken past reviews more seriously. From the first appointment Trident definitely had their own agenda. It was impossible to get in touch with anyone in the office directly and they haven't responded to voicemail or messages in a month.|Dr. Nolan and his staff work together so well to give each patient the best care possible. They are so helpful and will answer any question you have.  Dr. Nolan explains that pain management is just not medicines but physical therapy and injections.  Over July 4th I got an extreme exacerbation to my pain level and had to go to the ER three times but they just could not get the situation under control.  Going to the clinic this morning has helped so much.  With the spinal infusions of the meds in my spine done by Dr. Nolan I can say tonight I am better.  I really do not know what I would do without Dr. Nolan and his wonderful staff at Trident.  They are all trained so well to take care of each patient with kindness and the right help I need.  This clinic is my life saver and if you are in need of truly wonderful pain management I can tell you this is the place to go.  There are other locations in this clinic but this is the one I have chosen and GOD led me to them.

Upon entering which I did early, I had to answer all the verbal questions as usual. Insurance, ID, credit card, name again, address again, phone# again (I say again because I just handed her all that information on my drivers license)
And was told to have a seat and fill out the new patient questionnaire. (A LOT of pages many of which asked for the same info as page 1)
My hands are very arthritic so it's very hard to write. Especially as much as they were asking.
Anyway it took about 15 minutes to fill out their questionnaire. A lady called me to the back to take my vitals then led me to what I guess is an examination room where I was asked to wait. After waiting for over an hour in a room with the door closed. I walked back to the front desk and asked the nice lady what was going on. She just looked at me like a deer in the headlights and couldn't, I guess, comprehend the question so I stated that after all the questions both written and verbal they had stuck me in what was apparently an isolation ward for an hour. She still couldn't comprehend what the problem was.
1:45 minutes of my life gone $30 copay gone. I told the nice lady to enjoy that copay and take a good look at my back because they would NEVER see it again and walked out. On a side note there was not a single car in their parking lot except mine so they shouldn't have been soooo busy that they just couldn't see me.

Since becoming a patient I have had physical therapy order through this medical practice.  At this time my symptoms were so severe if I didn't knobetter I would have thought I had suffered a stroke on my left side. With continuous on going treatment I've hade a MRI on the area that is causing debilitating pain while compounding with another condition.

Between Carolina Spine and Pain Centers specifically Dr.J.O'QUINN and those the work him and the lexington Medical Center Network. I am more mobile now than I have been in 3 years.|I've had two injections so far with Dr. Hamilton. The first one didn't really do much for relief. Dr. Hamilton asked more questions and I told him I had PCOS as well. He said he thinks I actually have sacroiliac joint disfunction which he thought was the cause of my pain. So the second injection he did in a different location for that. And that was the most pain relief I have had since I had back problems since 2006. No other doctor has ever suggested it was sacroiliac joint disfunction. I'm so thankful for him and figuring out that that is where the pain is from. Also him and the tech that administer the shpts are so kind to me when they do it as they know I have severe anxiety issues.|The doctor told me he would not prescribe much needed pain medication for my back, because I was taking prescribed chlonazapam for dystonia blepherospasm seizures. I take 4 mg per day and it is not uncommon for patients with my symptoms to take up to 20mg per day. Do some research, Doc. I was having seizures when I was speaking with him. I think he prejudiced me or didn't like me and decided he wasn't working with me. I waited 3 months for the appointment, after having a heart attack.
I know chlonazapam is prescribed with pain medications, as I've had these issues for 20 years, and my doctors have always prescribed them. He was very short and very obviously did not want to work with me.|I have been going here since Dr. Herlong left Sandhills, 3 years ago? maybe more... I have had multiple injections with Dr. Hamilton, who is great, and appointments with Savannah, and Dr. O'Quinn, who are also great.

The phone number that is available that people are complaining about I have never had an issue with. The nurse's line will call back within 24 hours like promised when message is left, and appointment line most of the time answers, and gives more information than most appointment centers by far. After four back surgeries, a brain surgery, cubital and carpal tunnel, and now SCS implant, I would never even dream of having a different group of people manage my pain. Thanks.

That is thanks in part of Dr John and Liz! Both are so sweet and so professional. Dr John knows his stuff and what is so amazing is he doesn't push the breathe out of me. I've only been to one other chiropractor in the Spartanburg area and I'll never go back there. But there is one that has me walking but he is 3 hours away.

They were supposed to call me and let me know ahead of time.  I've had an appt scheduled since 7/17 for 8/28. DR is out of town for my appt so I was asked to come in sooner. I filled my paperwork out and immediately sent it back to them with my insurance info on 7/17. I arrived at 9 am as requested. I was greated & asked if i had filled out my paperwork. I exclaimed that i had on the 17th & sent back to them immediately,  she found that she did have a chart created for me.  I gave them copies of my ins and DL cards. I waited over 1/2 hr to be called back. Got into room and was told that my Blue Essentials BCBS OF SC plan hasn't been paying so I needed to be prepared to pay $250 for today's visit.  ""They pay some claims but they've not been paying so they collect the $250 when you leave & ""she's"" been calling patients and telling them."" At no point was I told this.  Unfortunately I don't have $250 to spend at this time.  My OOP ins obligations have been met so I expected this appt to be covered. I was looking so forward to this visit to hopefully finally get it of pain.  I'm so angry now & disappointed. What an unorganized disaster of a front office.

3 months later I'm needing it again. This time there office and my insurance company couldn't get things going unless I intervened.

So after a hour they tell me it's good to go, great!! I called the office and they said, yes your on. Come in that day, great!!

It's 2am and I'm laying here in more pain than one can imagine and nothing, they just want to give shots that deteriorate your body quicker and reek more havoc than pain pills ever thought about. And the thing is they will tell you these shots will work for a day or two. DONT DO IT ITS NOT WORTH BEING IN WORSE SHAPE.....THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG EPIDEMIC IS OVER THESE NEW RULES ARE ONLY HURTING THE REAL PEOPLE IN PAIN.|I brought my aunt for her appointment with Dr Sullivan. Diane the front desk lady has little to no idea how to talk to people. It seemed like we were an inconvenience for her as she yelled at us for needing masks upon arrival. The male nurse we worked with was great as well as Lauren Justen the PA. Dr Sullivan was arrogant and demeaning. Offered no real solutions and was generally rude. Made my aunt feel like her pain was to be expected and really wasn't interested in helping her. Thankfully we got a referral for rehabilitation for her back and her primary doctor will manage her meds. We will never see him again as my Aunt would rather be in pain than deal with him.

Tried to call the number that the owner responded with but you can't get a hold of anybody. Nice. Just another reason I wouldn't recommend these folks to anybody.|I love this place I know that a lot of people say that it's unprofessional and that they have no bed size manner. One thing I love is that not only does the doctor talk you through every inch of what he's doing he makes jokes to take your mind off of the pain and of the procedure. People that have a problem with the practice are people that are not looking for a long life of no pain they're more chasing pain medicine. Which makes it hard for people like me that needs help with all the pain that they're in. I would advise anybody that's trying to better their life and manage the pain to visit|DO NOT GO TO PIEDMONT MEDICAL ANYTHING!! Trust the reviews! They are a nightmare! From the moment you make an appointment, see the doctor, give them your copay, your insurance card and get a wrong bill tjat they will refuse to fix EVEN if your insurance is telling them what needs to be fixed. WORST, WORST HEALTHCARE PLACE EVER!|I have been a patient at Southeast Pain and Spine Care for many years now and have always been very grateful for the help, care and support I received there. I was a patient of Dr. Pociask for several years and was very happy with his care. Now I see Dr. Sullivan and always feel well treated and confident in his care. The staff has become like family and are also very knowledgeable. I could not recommend a better place for pain care!|I 10000% would steer people away from this practice. I went to Dr. Pociask in January 2020 for injections... and am STILL dealing with billing issues to this date, November 2022.

As a Doctor, he's fine enough. His bedside manner isn't great, but it's tolerable. Unfortunately, the practice is a mess. They warned me that I'd get a bill from him, and a bill from the hospital. I actually got three bills, and the external billing service they use is even more of a mess than they are.

Seeing him wasn't worth the headache of getting the billing sorted, frankly.|I am a patient at Southeast Pain and Spine. Dr. Sullivan, the PAs and staff have taken care of my back and body pain for 10+ years with respect and care. The medication and procedures are gauged to keep me active within the limits of my body.

I have degenerative scoliosis and sciatica. My condition has worsened to the point that many days I am in so much pain I can't even walk.  My husband bought me a power wheelchair so I can at least get around in the house. I called the office in desperation begging to come in and get some help. I explained to the receptionist my situation and was told they  could see me in a month.  She never bothered to check with anyone else.  Totally unconcerned and without any empathy.  It doesn't matter how good the doctors may or may not be if you have to wait a month or more to see someone when you're already dealing with debilitating pain.

UPDATE:  The office scheduled me for an appointment on Jan. 20.  I have called to cancel as I am seeking a second opinion .  I've left a voicemail and a message on your portal.  Does a live person ever answer the phone or even respond to a message?|I was seen in office July 3rd and was supposed to be referred for an MRI. My MRI referral was never put in, so I've called for 2 weeks straight with no call back.. Finally the order was sent but faxed to the wrong place, so now back to calling with no call back. I would love to know who office manager because I would love to speak to them. MRI finally got scheduled for August 26th and this office never sent the pre authorization from my insurance company so the appointment had to be rescheduled, so now I have to wait another month.|I've been a patient since March 2021 with no prior infractions & in one day I was discharged from the program, without any warning, without a re-test of any kind. I was given my regular drug test in January 2024, I went to the doctor a month later on February 27th, 24 and was told by PA- Turner that I failed my drug test in January. That my test showed I had no medication in my system. I tried to explain to him, that there was no way possible because I had just had a knee replacement surgery on January 8th, 24 & that my pre-op medication was Percocet 5mg I was taking along with my normal 10 mg Lortab.  Then he told me that my pill count was short in September 2023, I told him that's when I was in the hospital for 4 days, my medication was at home and I had no supervision over it. PA-Turner told me that there was nothing else he could do and that he would not write my prescription for my pain medication anymore. I feel this was so unfair because he could have re-tested me, gave me a verbal warning. But no he choose to kick me out of the program. I know of previous patients of Carolina Spine & Pain who have failed drug test with street drugs in their system whose been retested, medication lowered, given warnings before being kicked outta the program. Then on Wednesday, I called and left a message for the office manager or Dr. O'Quinn to call me back so I could discuss this with them and to this day, Saturday, February 2nd, 24 neither of them has even returned my call. So unprofessional. I was prescribed narcotics by this facility and have been on them well.over 2years and I was kicked outta the program without the opportunity to find a new doctor, without a refill of my medication to carry me for the next month while I search for another doctor. All PA- Turner gave me was a 14 day supply that I can't pick up because the drug store is out of the medication. All the money this office has made from me being a patient, to just be thrown away like I'm nothing, is so unprofessional. I don't advise anyone to see PA-Turner and if you are his patient switch to someone else. He's rude and has no bedside manner. I should have stopped seeing him in September 2023 when he said my medication count was short. His actions have even left me without a doctor to treat my back issues. Living with daily chronic pain is hell and has diminished my quality of life, my daily medication helped me get outta bed every day to try to go on. Now I left without medication, without a pain doctor or a doctor for my back pain.|I never had a problem until they started making me see this one PA and I complained on two different occasions and they're still making me see him and will not allow me to see any other one that I have seen when I first started coming there, my husband doesn't want me going because they want let me see any other PA and it's not far or right. Then the lady at the front desk that checks you in never told me I had a copay for the whole four months 5 months I was coming so now I have an outstanding bill I explain this to the billing department and nothing was done. I don't understand never been treated like this before from any practice I've ever been|Dr Leche is the best.  Mom loves him.  He's always so kind, patient and empathetic of her pain. His assistant is awesome as well.  Equally as kind, patient and emphatic.  We would follow them anywhere.  Very nice clean facility conveniently located on 290 in Duncan just a few minutes off of I-85.|Just pill pushers who don't answer the phone or return calls.
They also will wait for a year to tell you that you owe money on a bill, that you can't prove that you owe it. It's just a scam that a regular doctor should be prescribing pain medication!
All they do is prescribe medication And they don't know you or your medical history!
But they charge as though they were a real specialist!
Their specialty nothing more than a scam.
Going to talk to senators and congressmen about getting pain medication put back in the hands of the family physicians. Not an extra clinic and expense!
Especially unprofessional people like these who don't bother with the phone!|The dr was very nice but way to many people were scheduled for the same time. Not enough parking at all & so many people that some people signed in & had to go back outside to wait because there was nowhere to sit. They have got so much better about scheduling & I couldn't be happier about that. The people have been very nice & professional & I appreciate that so much. The lady that I see is so sweet & really cares about my health & if I need anything I can call her, I really appreciate that they stay on top of my health needs, everybody that I have dealt with is so nice & that means alot to me. I go to their office in Duncan, I know they have a couple of more locations. They are taking New patients so if you need good dr's I highly recommend them.

I have been seeing Mr. Brant since Loren left & he is very nice too, everybody that I have delt with there has been very nice & understanding & I really appreciate that.|My boyfriend has had constant headaches for years and he has tried everything from therapy to medicines and shots.

It's very upsetting to drive one hour to his office only to be turned away bc you were 3 min later (after being told no worries!) than ""policy"", but YOU can sit there and wait on him for hours and it's OK because your time means nothing.

He basically  in so many words that I'm faking until he seen my scar from the surgery. The surgeon from LMC said my back it to severe to operate  on because it could harm me more.

He was great in the beginning but I started noticing uneasy things. For one I always seen men coming in and going up to the desk for prescriptions. Not once did I see a woman. Second he started to rush through the procedure and I was not getting any relief. The last visit was the final as I received a cervical injection and I almost didn't make it to my vehicle. I could not move my neck and by the time I got home I had a full blown migraine. All he said was wait it out or come back to the office for oxygen.There must have been an air bubble somewhere. You don't check this before injecting!! Really? I couldn't see to drive or move my head. I contacted my family physician and she prescribed me the migraine medication. I gave 1 star because other than him the other staff are great. The front desk are awesome and Ryan the radiologist and Jane that deals with insurance are spot on!! Would not recommend Warrick to no one|I am heard here.  My pain is taken seriously. We've tried some of everything and they didn't work (well the injections worked for 3 days). Unfortunately I'm not a candidate for surgery and I can't take most pain meds for my back pain because it'll interfere with medication I'm on.  But they found something.  And it's working|I've been with Dr Warrick and his staff for years, which is always a sign of a great physician & staff. I've found him to be helpful & knowledgeable. He & his staff stay extremely busy & it can interfere some in the personality department. I've never felt rushed or pressured. The call backs are wonderful, fast, & usually the same day. Even with all the State & Federal Regulations I've never had a problem with changing or getting my much needed medications. Dr Warrick has always shown
""There may not be a cure but there still can be  Sunshine and Relief.""!|It is with great pleasure that I write this review for Dr. Michael Todd Warrick, MD and his dependable RN; Laurie, as well as his medical assistants and all of his wonderful staff. Dr. Warrick's office personnel always greet you with a smile, which makes knowing them such a delightful experience!  I had major low back (L-5 Lumbar surgery) with Dr. DeHoll, MD two years ago and I was thoroughly impressed by how well Dr. Warrick interacted with my surgeon, Dr. DeHoll in Columbia.  Furthermore, my husband and I cannot compliment Dr. Warrick and his staff enough because he does not overprescribe any pain medication whatsoever.  Senator and Mrs. John Edward Courson and I recommend Dr. Warrick and his caring staff highly and without any reservations.|After being with this self important narcissist for years we have finally made the breakaway from this rote individual that will tell you point blank to your face that he doesn't care about you or your pain beyond an aspirin a day and that he is the doctor, not you. He is more interested in his theater and new girlfriend, apparently. The only compassionate person that can speak with kindness in that office is Whitney. Well, contrary to Warrick's belief, there ARE other physicians out there with compassion for those that are unfortunate to have chronic pain. Both my wife and I urge you to find that one and leave this one to play with his numbers on the computer.

Run!|My mom was sent to Dr. Warrick after her regular pain management doctor relocated.  She never complained about the pain of an injection until her first visit with him when she said it hurt very bad.  The injection was not effective and she waited 3 months, in pain from 4 lumbar disc issues, to go back again.  On the second visit, Dr. Warrick apparently missed the spot and she lost feeling in her legs for 3 days and was unable to walk.  That's on top of the much more severe pain she had after that injection.  Dr. Warrick basically dismissed her at the visit when she informed him she couldn't feel her legs.  His response was that ""it wasn't unusual and that everything would be fine in a couple hours.""  That was the only time I had to bring her out of an appointment for an injection in a wheelchair.  Needless to say he was completely wrong and after 3 days she was able to walk again but still in severe pain.  She called her Primary Doctor who arranged for her to go to see Dr. Van Damm in Chapin after that and for over a year, she had no issues and never felt pain during or after an injection.  She finally after nearly 40 years of dealing with the pain, got a referral to Dr DeHol who performed a successful surgery to repair her back and now she is pain free and active again after all those years because she was scared to have surgery.  I now have a major back issue and I received a referral to see the doctor who hurt my mother so bad and probably got lucky he didn't do even more damage than he did.  I have not even heard back from my referral which was over a month ago which doesn't matter because I wouldn't let him take my temperature.  Too put people in pain and then show no regard or explanation as to why is the reason this butcher will never see me.  Dr. DeHol and Dr. Van Damm both couldn't even say one good word about Dr. Warrick.  I have made my own appointment with Dr. Lamotta in Irmo.  He has taken incredible care of my aunt who has has already had two back surgeries and both knees replaced.  She is pain free now as well.  He actually has a 5 star rating and I can't find one negative comment about the level of care he delivers and is not about putting people on pain medication or injections if at all possible.  I wish I could see DeeHol but he doesn't accept my insurance so I've now made an NHC on my own with Dr. Lamata. It's been a long journey up to today when I scheduled my own appointment with someone other than Dr.Warrick and although it's a much longer distance, it was the only clear choice to make.  I take no pain medication and don't want any.  I just want the root problem resolved so hopefully I can get my life back after 7 months of pain.  Don't let anyone you care at all about be treated by this doctor.  Seems like all the positive reviews are coming from women much younger than my mother.  Pattern?  .  I'm relieved in knowing I'm going to finally see someone who can help me and cares.|Awesome bedside manner, very caring and gets the job done. My other doctor left and left alot of patients high and dry.He took the chance and took a stand. Very impressed with entire staff.
I think all the ones who gave bad reviews had either not seen him yet or just want something to complain about. These doctors who deal with all the pain meds and stuff are under such restrict rules bc of those who abuse and sell the medicine. Honestly the doctors i have or have had dont compare to the compassionate the care he gives. Yes took a few weeks to get an appointment but he also had to review my records. Im sorry people it would be a waist of your time if he cant help your situation. What ive learned over the past year is you have to be your own advocate for your healthcare. These family doctors see so many patients they dont have the time to deal with pity party people. I have a pain pump and was dropped by a pain management practice bc they let the doctor and team go and Dr Warrick made some phone calls. I dont care what bad reviews people on here want to give
But you wont be sorry when he becomes your doctor. Call everyday till appointment. Its up to you to be your own advocate.|I've seen Dr Warrick for many years now. I moved from Sumter to the Charleston area and love Dr Warrick AND STAFF sooo much that i make the 2 hour drive monthly. He's cool, calm and collected at ALL times. He's honest about all treatment options and ALWAYS has time to perform injections to anyone with an appointment. I will continue to make this drive to his office as long as he's here!

My mother, Susie English, was under Dr. Sloan's care for pain management. Tragically, she passed away a year ago today (at the young age of 52 years old) from sepsis secondary to epidural abscess.

Following her spinal injection treatment on Thursday, May 18, 2023, my mother's health deteriorated rapidly following her last treatment, culminating in her untimely and unexpected death on May 24, 2023.

Our family is devastated by this loss and we hope that sharing our story will help prevent similar tragedies from happening to others; ultimately, we urge anyone seeking pain management to consider this experience before entrusting your care to this establishment.|When I came to this practice I thought I was going to have to have surgery as the next step. That was several years ago. Dr. Sloan uses a fluoroscope to position the injections exactly where they will do the most good. I currently receive neck and lower back injections which allow me to have a quality of life I cannot have without them. He monitors my pain meds to keep them at just the right level so that I am not feeling drugged all the time but have the pain relief I need between injection visits.
He also puts me under light sedation for the procedure. That is very important to me.
The most important thing about going to this clinic is the people who support Dr. Sloan. I have found some very good friends who care about me and not just as a medical number. I highly recommend this practice.|Dr Allan Sloan and CSTA Pain Management are incredible. This office has allowed me to work comfortably again. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

I Highly recommend CSRA Pain Management for anyone needing a caring Doctor and staff.|Dr. Sloan has no patience with people who have panic attacks and ADHD. Husband just needed his regular pain meds to function. He was told he was not going to get his regular dose and if he didn't take the shots he would get nothing. He tried the shots again, they still don't work. Now he has no medication because the good Dr. Sloan isn't interested in helping just taking your money.|Been going to CSRA for many years. I have always gotten great service. If you need help he will give it to you. His staff is great. Always treats me nice.

The office was dirty and run down.

You would think that a pain specialist would have a gentle touch.

I have been to several doctors, several specialists, tried several medications all to help with one specific problem that is increasingly getting worse. I am now at the point that it is pretty much debilitating due to the amount of pain I suffer from. I went to my first appointment today and the doctor sat down and looked me in my face and told me there was nothing she could do for me. Then proceeded to message my psychiatrist to inform him of how I felt so much ""hopelessness"", those words never came out of my mouth. She also said she was sending records to my family doctor and told me, with zero empathy, that they probably wouldn't help me either.
If I could give this business a -100, I seriously would. No wonder they're not accredited with the Better Business Bureau.|In my opinion this is not the place to go ! When I told them I wanted to come off Morphin the Dr said ""You can't stop taking your Morphin"" I said I understood about tapering off and that's what I wanted to do ! She said ""No You can't stop taking the Morphin"" I said Excuse me ! I will stop taking it and she said fine then got up and walked out and stopped my Morphin right then ! I went through Bad withdrawals which nearly killed me ! But I got off of it ! The reason I quit was because it was shutting down my gut ! I have terrible IBS now and I think years of Morphin did it at the hands of this office ! I don't recommend going here !|I would give you minus 5 review at least.
This place is the worst Dr office I have ever been to.
First:
They sent me bunch of paper to fill it before my App I did and gave it to the front desk. They let me wait in office until a lady came in and start ask me about all my info again, I told her I wrote every thing down and she said sorry I did not have time to enter it in, I said it is okay after she is done she told me the Dr will be with you shortly.
Second:
After sometime a Man come to the office start the same thing about the history, I told him I wrote everything down and the lady before you got it and entered in the system too, he said I'm PA, I start again for the third time and he said I will inform the Dr and she will be with you.
Third:
The PA came back and ask me what I want to feel better I told him I need trigger point in my lower back. He said we do not give injection in this office you need to come to Columbia office is about hour and half from here.
I told him when I made the app no one told me that, how come?? he said sorry I ask him how about some medication he refused. I asked  about the Dr he said she is going in meeting.
Really... I told him why you or the office let me come here and there is no medication, no injection no doctors you think I am coming for fun?
Really I was very upset how come a Dr office do something like that. I will inform the Insurance company and I will let my family Dr to never send any one to this office and I will not recommend it to any one.
If they know the Dr not available that time why they did not call me to cancel and reschedule me other time.
What I went through really NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ANY ONE AT ALL.|Zero due diligence on their part. I was forced to stop my low dose of Xanax 2 weeks before they would make a decision... I went through the withdrawals because I need the help so badly. I was then denied for taking Xanax even though I never got it filled. They never checked any hospital records and seem to be completely incompetent. I was told that you can't quantify kidney pain... Do not recommend.|The best Doctors and Staff anyone could ask for.

Karma is a bizitch|This review tells a story that speaks for itself and does not necessarily apply to any particular Spartanburg physicians or centers-
CHRONOLOGY
Douglass Allen suffered a left leg, upper calf sports training injury on August 24. Within a week, the upper calf symptoms were almost gone, but mild  lower back pain radiating down the left thigh was occurring, especially in the morning. I took two weeks off before preparing for a sports tournament.
I visited my physicians at Family Group of the Carolinas, Landrum, September 23, before driving to the three day tournament and was prescribed pain medicine which I didn't start taking until after the tournament despite mild pain.
Following that  September 25-27 tournament,  my lower back, and especially  left thigh pain became much worse and debilitating.
I again visited my physicians at Family Group of the Carolinas, Landrum, October 2, and had x-rays of the lumbar region and was given additional  pain and prednisolone prescriptions.  An MRI was scheduled for 10/6.
The 10/2 X-ray results follow-
LUMBAR SPINE SERIES
INDICATION: Left-sided low back pain and sciatica.  Pain severity rated 7/10.
COMPARISON:5/4/2017
Bony density is within normal limits, with no fracture or suspicious legion. The posterior elements are intact. The paraspinous soft tissues are unremarkable for age.
Disc degenerative changes and posterior facet arthropathy findings remain evident ... prominent at L5-S1 and L4-L5.
IMPRESSION:  SIMILAR APPEARANCE TO BEFORE OF DJD FINDINGS MOST PRONOUNCED AT L4-L5 AND L5-S1.

10/6, MRI results-
""The MRI shows multiple levels of moderate degenerative disc disease and narrowing.  At L3-4 there is compression of the exiting left L3 nerve root as well as the L4 nerve root on the left.""

October 9- I was referred to Dr. Sonny Gill

October 12, 16, and 19-  I called Dr. Gill's office to see if they had received referral, to tell them that I was an athlete and had suffered complications of an athletic injury, and to tell them that I was debilitated despite two rounds of prednisolone and weeks of pain medicine.

October 19- Late afternoon I received a call that I had been referred to the nearby Pain Center.

October 20 and 23  I left messages at the Pain Center asking if they had received my referral and scheduled an appointment.

October 25- As of today I have not been contacted by the Pain Center.
My comments-  Apparently Dr. Gill's office and the Pain Center do not use the Spartanburg Regional ""My Chart"" or reply to messages left on their phone system.  I was referred, first to Dr. Gill, and then 11 days later by his office to a nearby Pain Center, I don't know which one.  Now 6 days later, there's been no contact from the Pain Center.

I've wondered for over 3 weeks if perhaps an epidural steroid injection might be indicted and prescribed.  Also, I wonder if the sciatica diagnosis is correct since my symptoms are different. Unlike sciatica, sitting, even driving a car, is my most comfortable position, but lying down and standing or walking is extremely painful.  I get little sleep because lying down is so painful. I hate taking pain pills, but have been taking prescribed acetaminophen-COD, hydrocodon, and gabapentin which help reduce pain only a little.  The gabapentin (or combination of drugs?) has given me dizziness and vertigo, so I recently stopped taking it.

I have been debilitated by pain now for over a month and seem to be no closer to resolution here in Spartanburg County than I was a month ago, so I have successfully made an appointment with the St. Luke  Hospital Pain Center, Columbus, NC, for tomorrow Monday, October 26.  What I think I probably actually need is evaluation by a specialist.                           In 5 weeks, I've gone from being a national class age group athlete to being so debilitated by pain (and some times dizziness) that I have trouble walking and sleeping.|Don't really care.

The nurse practitioner refused to listen to anything I had to say and prescribed some bogus medication that you could tell was brand new(which means expensive) and being pushed by a sales rep, as it came in a brochure with a voucher attached stating ""up to $0 cost"". I informed her after reading the fine print that I would not be eligible since I'm a Medicaid patient and Medicaid doesn't work with prescription coupons.

They took care of him and kept him from going into withdrawals.|I have been a patient of this practice since they opened and in my opinion Dr. Snoderly and Nurse Practitioner Jammie Emerson and their entire staff are the most professional, caring, thoughtful, kind, and friendly pain management team I've ever been a part of.
Dr. Snoderly and Jammie Emerson research and find the latest and best course of treatment to help with my problems which are not the kind of problems a normal person has.

(Jamie and Christie) to the office manager (Denise) to Dr. Snoderly and everyone else THIS FACILITY is
WONDERFUL!!!!!!  They are always concerned and certainly take every moment to hear your issues and come up with a great plan of action.  Dr Snoderly... well I can't say enough about her!  She gets her job done while being extremely caring as well.
I just love this group!
I would highly recommend them to anyone!!|The customer service of the front desk staff is ""HORRIBLE!!!!"" I understand we are still dealing with COVID, but to SIT at the computer and constantly yell at the patients is utterly unprofessional!!!!! I watched several elderly patients attempt to check in and the woman who sits to the right as you enter the building (long black hair) is absolutely rude beyond measure. This has happened on a few occasions when I have  come for appointments. Instead of her getting up off of her behind and talking to the patients like human beings, she just sits and yells at them. The elderly woman she was checking in was trying to explain something to her and all she continued to do was sit and yell ""I cant hear you"". Well dah... get up and acknowledge her. One patient was making her credit card payment and instead of the woman behind the counter taking the card from the patient to charge, she made the patient lay her card up against the sliding glass door so she could type in the card number. Are you serious? You do not treat people this way. When she handed her paperwork, again she did not bother to slide the glass door at all. Instead she slipped the paper between the cracks in the window. Again, inhumane treatment of human beings. Do you think people are here because they have nothing better to do???
During the same visit she was in an argument with another patient. Again because of her unprofessional behavior. She has a nasty attitude, she is completely unprofessional and she should not be working the reception of a doctors office. My surgeon recommended this practice to me. The nurses and doctors are amazing!!!! Getting past that front desk staff person is a real game changer. I will make sure I mention this to my surgeon team and hopefully they can recommend another office.|I was first referred to Dr. Snoderly six year ago by my back surgeon physician  in hopes she may help me avoid surgery. Dr. Snoderly (and basically the same staff from my first visit) have provided significant professional care several times each year since then.

Recently, I inadvertently re- injured my spine late Friday. In need of attention for severe back/leg pain over the weekend , I arrived at the United Physicians  Office at 7:30 a.m. Monday. The technicians saw me sitting in the rain as the only car in their parking lot and immediately took me inside by wheelchair as I could not walk.The front office personnel (Destiny)  found a brief period in their hectic schedule for an assessment.

I was told it's because my cardiac stents (previous malpractice patient). I've had plenty of MRI's, with the stents..lol..  When I returned to Dr Willoughby's office. He couldn't even see me. Sent Catherine Gallier to see me, she stated there was a special cat scan, but it is very painful. Why lie to me, I can handle the truth and pain.  When I questioned her lying, I was released from the practice so I could have the Medtronic Neuro stimulation removed so I can get a MRI of my brain to check on my brain tumor, and MRI for my ruptured discs and pinched nerve. I hope Tidelands Health can find better physician's who care about fixing the pain instead of ripping off patients insurance company and the hospital's.

He accused me of taking my dying husabands phentanl, No questions ask the bimbo accused me told me to sighn a piece paper and find another Doctor  I went to my primary care doct that day for I was concerned how his medication showed up in my urine test . Come to find  he was on such a high does it was coming through his pores and when we sleep snuggle that's how  I was being exposed .all the years I saw thus Doctor you would think he would had known me better or at least face me himself not his flunkie, be concerned for my health my wellbeing .
I truly I was hurt more then angry .Reading the post i now wonder if he was suffering from mental break ,since I wasn't the only person he accused of taking drugs not thiers . after years as his patient I was hurt he asked no questions
The phentanol in my system was low he should had known it was from contact exposure
His flunkey Said I cannot get contact exposure.
I  truly hope the chubby little receptionist went back to school to  learn somthing other then to be rude

Everyone is so friendly and caring.  They go above and beyond to make you comfortable and to ensure that all of your needs are met.  They always take time to answer all of your questions.  I always see Katie Hodges when I come in and I couldn't be more impressed. I highly recommend this practice to everyone!|I have nothing but great things to say about this practice. All of the staff are just all around good people.i get treated like I'm family here. I been well taken care of since I started coming here almost 2 years ago|Dr. Brandy Mountcastle is one of the first Drs I've had that genuinely cares about her patients and it really feels like we are working together as a team to get my health on track. The staff is all friendly and very helpful. I am not the easiest medical case but this team has yet to make me feel like a burden. If you are looking for a new medical team this is the place to go. I cannot say enough good things.|I actually hate to leave this review because I like the physicians but I will not be returning due to mismanagement of my case on the part of the ""nurses"" and office staff. I have only been a patient since August and since then have had two separate situations happen where ""nurses"" and office staff are not forwarding messages to the physicians but instead are sending generic ""make an apt"" responses when follow ups are not actually needed. I was actually told per Brandy I didn't need a follow up that she would chat with me about results and next steps through the portal. Well my CT was on 4/26 and I still haven't heard from anyone. I emailed on 5/1 and again on 5/3 to get the same reply each time, ""make an apt."" It took 10 days to get a reply after my last text through the portal. In the fall the nurse instructed me to ""continue medication"" when I was wanting an apt for labs to be rechecked after concerning symptoms. It took 3 months and 3 phone calls to get labs scheduled because ""they don't draw thyroid labs any sooner than every 3 months."" In January when labs came back elevated for me, I called again and was told the exact same thing ""continue medication your labs are normal."" I finally followed up with a specialist who agreed I was not being managed properly and with the medication changes I knew I needed I am feeling much better. As much as I like the physicians at the bedside, I can't go to a practice that has untrained ""nurses"" on staff giving bad medical advice to patients and that can not be bothered to even speak to the physician on the patients behalf. It should never take weeks to get a reply from your physicians office. I am a registered nurse and know first hand this is not how communication should be handled between patients and their physicians. So disappointing.......|I meant to do this a long time ago. To say I'm ecstatic about Brandy opening her own office is an understatement. She is the most caring doctor I've ever been to. Most doctors treat you like you are nothing but a number on a chart. She has had me take care of very important health matters that I probably would've never taken care of. Having kids you forget to take care of yourself. She makes sure you take care of yourself completely. I've recommended her to everyone who's ever asked me about a good doctor to see. Including most of my family go here now as well. Thank you for everything y'all do. Front desk staff and nurses are awesome too!!|I started seeing Brandy Mountcastle in late spring last year. Since then I have lost 50 lbs in about 7 months, have more energy, less pain in my knees, taking the right meds that help me, and feeling better than I have in 20 years. Brandy listens, helps you make a plan, holds you accountable, and does all the extras like Cortisone shots right in the office instead of sending me somewhere else. I finally feel like I have a relationship with my doctor and not just someone I see when I get sick. If you are looking for a new family doctor or want to make a change in your life to be healthier, try Brandy.|Brandy is very knowledgeable. She explains things and takes her time so the patient understands exactly what they need to know concerning their health.  She is compassionate and caring. This area is very fortunate to have her. The staff are very professional and friendly.|Brandy Mountcastle is one of the most knowledgeable and compassionate providers I have ever seen.

I had many eventful experiences and many uneventful ones. I am leaving a very honest review here.

I left crying and smiling, idk if it's b/c of how nervous he made me later on that made the ones where I left crying worse. He is a good Dr he does listen and tries to help but some of what he said confused me, ie, came in 1 pill short and he cut me that mo - he had told me ""it's ok as long as I let him know"" well when it happened a couple months later (1-2 pills short)  I came in I was honest with him and he told me ""being honest is telling him before I did it not after.."" there was a time I cut pills in half only taking the half when I felt like I needed it and he cut me for that b/c ""he is the dr and he doesn't write for one half he writes for a whole pill"" I told him I was sorry I didn't understand and told him I'd do anything he asks if he needs to know before hand I'd call before but when it happened it was over night or on the weekend but that I'd call, they wouldn't call me back or it would be days before I talked to them. I went to the ER ONE time during the 5 yrs I was a patient there and I was belittled for it b/c I have a panic disorder and I was having chest pains over 2 days ""what made u think this time it would be different"" (indicating it was panic). If you change your appt he will cut you (or change your meds altogether) I didn't do it often but I did a couple of times and both times at the end he either cut my mg or count. There were things he said that were contradictory, bad moods seemed to come out in his appts (again that couldve been me/my nerves), he yelled at me and slammed the door on me before, over asking about a lidocaine injection from another Dr (my daughter was in the room the day he did this). He did prescribe me fentanyl at the end of my treatment with him and I have young kids, I went to sleep, woke up, and my son was in the bed with me and it had peeled off. My son 11 at the time could be dead today - after the previous conversations I'd had with him about this medicine I felt like he wouldn't listen to me and/or change my prescription again so I left. The last prescription he gave me was never filled.

That being said - he did help me, he filled out my pa's when I needed it, he did listen to me (most of the time), there were times he'd cut jokes and I didn't get it (again could be nerves), he however did seem kinder to the men than he did me or a couple other women I met in the office, but when I left I can honestly say that the drs I met afterward weren't great either, there have been times I thought maybe I'd be better off going back. I was never able to fully let down my guard with him, I never knew what I was going to walk into but there is some kindness in his heart or soul. if your  nervous he will pick up on nerves and his mood will change if he senses it.
Overall I'd say everyone's experience is similar in some ways but different in others, some mesh well with him, while others may not, especially someone who has nerves or has ""white coat syndrome""
Dr Gupta if u read this thank you for taking care of me over the years I do realize how much better I had it then.|After moving back to SC I had to find a primary care physician as well as pain management. I opted to have Dr Gupta be both . After being in the hospital for 7 days and having to reschedule my appt Dr Gupta then proceeded to not refill my prescriptions that I have been on for 10 plus years. I have a laundry list of different Diagnoses that Dr Gupta chose not to prescribe my medication's therefore throwing my entire health at risk . Today I'm the office instead of refilling my normal medications he offered to give me Fentanyl as opposed to hydrocodone I refused then he wanted to put me on Dilaudid what kind of Dr tries to put you on these medications? When I told him I was going to do this review he stormed out of the room saying if I gave him a bad review he would give me a bad review I asked if he was threatening me as he went into the office across the hall and he slammed the door. I would not recommend this Dr as he does not have a patients health history first and foremost. I have never in my 55 years been treated so badly by a physician. I will be filing a formal complaint with the SC Medical Board and I highly suggest that any other patients that have been treated this way by this so called Physician to do the same.|I was a new patient who was hesitant after reading the reviews about even going to my appointment and I'm happy I did!! The doctor was really nice he talked to me asked me questions to determine the best treatment for me!! I'm not sure what doctor you'll are referring to with some of these reviews but it's definitely NOT Dr Gupta!!! His staff was amazing also if I could give him 10 stars I absolutely would have!!!|Worst Dr I've ever had to see and the rudest one too he hates patients to ask him any questions he's always in a bad mood I went to him for 5 years and I one day I had to reschedule my appointment and when I go back to him he changed my medication I asked why he was doing it and all he said was because I'm the Dr very unprofessional I will not be going back to Dr Gupta and I hope nobody else has to ever see this Dr I will be calling the sc medical board and I hope every patient he has does the same|He listened to me but didn't hear what I was saying. Made his diagnosis without looking at my X-rays or MRI. Treated me like I was there to get drugs which I wasn't. I never asked him for any medicines. Lectured me on getting my stress level under control which I told him I was doing. I hope I never have to go back to him.|Dr. Gupta is a great Doctor. I Have been seeing him for 4 yrs. now and truley feel he's one of the best at what he does, I give him a 5 star rating!|Unprofessional behavior is his standard. Always let his bad mood out on innocent and friendly patients, even when in pain, they keep keep it together, staying friendly to him.

We had tried the traditional gel and cortisone injections to control the pain but they were no longer helping. After a seriies of treatments at QC Kinetix she is walking without pain in her knees and it is such a relief. We were at the end of our rope with how to help her as knee surgery was not going to be an option.  I am so grateful we found QC Kintex and would highly recommend their services. I only wish we had found them years earlier!|I've been very physically active all of my life, so no surprise when in my 50's my knees started complaining. I heard the QC Kinetix commercials on the radio and knew that was the route for me. I could tell a difference when I walked out of their office after the first injection. The procedure is quick and relatively painless. My flexibility returned, and the stiffness vanished. A few weeks after my second injection I had an accident and injured my right meniscus. The pain was excruciating for about 4 days, and the swelling was such that bending my knee next to impossible. Luckily the day for my third injection was a week after the injury. I arrived at the office using a walker. They were able to drain the excess fluid from my knee, and I almost skipped back to my car.  The doctors and staff are a bonus! They are so personable, funny, and knowledgeable. The body is an amazing machine that strives to thrive, and regenerative medicine enhances its ability to heal itself.|I have two treatments left. One in two weeks and the other in three months. These procedures have been amazing for me. I could barely walk in August. Started my treatments and now I can walk with no pain. I can actually get up on my own power now a few months ago I had to have help getting up. It may not work as fast for some but I would definitely say try it and give it a chance to work.|Thank you, QC Kinetix, I had an amazing experience all around. The staff and Dr. Wang are a pleasure to go in and see, each and every visit was welcoming and informative. I feel that I made the better choice going with QC Kinetix vs going through surgery. I would recommend to anyone out there take the time to see if you are a good candidate for this type of medical help.

Greg was excellent and knowledgeable. Thank you QC Kinetix for a great experience.|I will start out by saying this is not an instant fix for whatever your problem is, that is why I waited before I wrote a review.  If you are expecting overnight results it most likely will not happen.  At least that was my experience.  I had my last shot in October of 2022.  I am just now starting to really feel the benefits.  It has reduced my pain and swelling by about 75 percent.  I also began a regimen of turmeric and Osteo Bi-Flex daily.  If you are patient and do not get discouraged, this is worth the money.  Just keep your expectations where they need to be.  The commercials have accounts of folks being completely healed in 3 months.  That was not my experience, but it has helped tremendously over about a 9 month period.  I also highly recommend getting the stem cells instead of just PRP shots.  I gave a 4 because it didn't work as quickly as I had hoped, but it does eventually show results.|The staff was great and the treatment helped a great deal, without my needing to do surgery.

His nurses are so efficient, kind and funny. I am grateful for the staff who work here. They are truly caring and compassionate.|Dr Frost was very thorough with explaining in detail of what the procedure was going to consist of. During the procedure both his assistants and himself kept me aware of what to expect during the whole ordeal. I was very impressed and pleased.|They are fine doctors and staff except for the general policy (presented as ""it's federal law"") that they will not prescribe opioid pain medication if someone is on another prescribed narcotic, such as benzodiazepines. I have managed my pain the last 20 years with 10-15 50mg tramadol. Tramadol is nearly impossible to abuse, and at that dosage, even if one cared to abuse them, it would last perhaps two or three days maximum. And tramadol does not work if injected. Meanwhile, after seeing my therapist today, she told me she has multiple patients on benzos in combination with opioids, and even medical cannabis. She expressed her disbelief in my story because she has so many clients who fit that profile. I get it; I am still in disbelief. Personally, I have met few doctors in South Dakota who don't treat me like a junkie simply because I lived the last 15 years in Mexico, and reported I managed my pain with tramadol. I should have just lied like an addict would have. This whole situation explains why there is such a drug problem here as compared to when I moved to Mexico. When people are suffering, it is only natural for them to seek relief wherever they can when doctors let them down.|Dr. Harper and his team are TOP NOTCH!!! Dr. Harper & his staff go out of their way, and above and beyond for their patients. He is so thorough and takes time to explain what is happening to you. They NEVER make you feel rushed or uncomfortable. Their beside manners are one of a kind. Highly recommended and appreciate his staff.|Dr. Huot was friendly, professional and knowledgeable!

<p><p>If you've never considered physical therapy as a SOLUTION, it's time to discover just how good you can feel. Many patients come to us after trying numerous other treatments without success, only to find that targeted physical therapy addresses the root cause of their discomfort rather than just masking symptoms. Our evidence-based techniques combine hands-on manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and education to empower you throughout your recovery journey.</p></p>

<p><h3>Early Intervention Makes a Difference</h3></p>

<p><p>Have a sprain, strain or nagging pain? Let us take the first look. Research consistently shows that addressing injuries early leads to faster recovery times and better outcomes. As direct access providers, we can evaluate and treat many conditions without requiring a physician referral first, saving you time and money while getting you on the path to recovery sooner.</p></p>

<p><h3>Why Choose Physical Therapy First</h3></p>

<p><p>Choosing physical therapy first over other healthcare options is the right path to recovery. Our non-invasive approach focuses on natural healing, improved function, and prevention of future injuries. Many patients find they can avoid surgery, reduce or eliminate pain medication use, and return to activities they love faster through consistent physical therapy treatment.</p></p>

I am a 59-year-old widowed disabled lady who has to have her oxygen everywhere she goes and that has become a shut-in since 2020. I am trying to address many medical issues that I have. This entails many appointments, many tests and many different doctors at many different locations. Some would say I am easily confused at this point! On Friday, April 19th I had an appointment at 9:00 a.m. for a consultation for carpel tunnel surgery at the Spine Center (4141 5th St.). I had already been to that location for a nerve test on my arms and it was a delightful visit (well, as delightful as a nerve test appointment can be). Everyone involved with that appointment was kind, friendly, efficient and thorough.
I am at the mercy of others for rides, and others refers to my one neighbor and my son. So for this appointment my neighbor dropped me off on her way to Hill City for work. I arrived safely and go inside and wait in line for just a couple minutes and I get up to the receptionists, there's three of them, and I say my name and my appointment time and I am told that I am at the wrong location! I wasn't even aware there was a second location (I had been given the address of the other location 7220 Mt. Rushmore Rd. but obviously that went in one ear and out the other) and was immediately distraught because I had no other way to get to the other location by my appointment time. So all three receptionist are speaking to me about the mix-up and I said ""Well I'm going to have to call and reschedule because I'm not going to have enough oxygen to wait and go there"" and so on. I didn't get the names of all three  of them but the one name I did get was Donna. I had lost most of my faith in humanity with the way the world has become but Donna restored some of that! She went above and beyond and then some to make sure I got to my appointment on time, she is definitely an angel among Us ( and I am not quite sure that she knows that, but I did tell her)!",2025-02-26|2025-02-20|2025-02-18|2025-02-21|2024-07-23|2025-02-25|2024-05-14|2024-04-22,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",88.6|85.6|81.6,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ2zRR_f9CfYcRghSclY6P8gE,76

I went in to see him for a bulging disk which was a previous work injury. He kept making comments on my weight and that I couldn't have surgery. Yes, I know I'm fat but surgery would be the last option I would choose for me.

When I returned for my epidural, I was lying on the table knowing a needle was going to go in my spine having to listen to him making sexist comments about women and maternity leave. Boetel's RN was due soon and her husband was getting paternity leave. He thought that was the most ridiculous thing. The women in the room got quiet. I did tell him the US is leaps and bounds behind other countries in this department- that Sweden parents get a year. Then he finally stopped. After receiving this epidural, it flared sciatica up on both sides worse than anything before - one thing I will not blame him for because this stuff happens and I do not think/hope it was not on purpose. I was in so much pain I couldn't walk more than 3 minutes at a time because of the burning, searing pain down both of my legs.

But WORST of all is the NEGLECT I received after that epidural. I called Sanford and they said he was on vacation until the next week and they didn't have a covering provider. He went one vacation and NO ONE covered him and I couldn't see anyone else ""because dr boetel did not sign off on it."" I sat in the worst pain of my life. I could only get up to use the bathroom. All I could do was cry, my husband made me go to the ER. I'm an RN in my 30s I don't go to the ER. That's when I decided I would move to Avera.

During the time where I could not move without being in pain and having been neglected, it made me think about all of his patients that live with chronic pain and wondering if he treated them like me. I should have said something sooner to advocate for these people. I am saying it now because one of my friends asked me who she should see because she didn't want to see the same arrogant provider I saw. She got set up with him...thankfully intercepted that.

So if you want sexist, fat-phobic, neglectful man who thinks too highly of himself he is your choice.

If you want better, go to avera spine! Dr Faryna and Tim his CNP were AMAZING!|I was very happy with in my dealings with Dr. Boetel. I had a back issue and he began a sensible diagnostic approach (physical therapy, MRI, Cortisone, wait a little longer, and finally fusion surgery). It would have been great shorten the diagnostic process but in my case I feel he took the right approach.|The following opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.
I allowed myself a second visit to Dr. Tom Boetel before writing a review since I developed a poor view of the Physician and thought he was just having an off day. However, after coming back for a second appointment, I now know his true character and approach to medicine, and I would like the opportunity to share my experience and opinion of my interaction.
I want to start by saying that the mixed to poor reviews of the physicians on Google and Healthgrades do not reflect Sanford as an organization that provides some of the best services in the region. Nor do the nursing or X-ray staff, who are incredible and some of the best at what they do. They were the highlights of my interactions with Dr. Boetel and shouldn't be penalized as a reflection of the Physician's performance.
I am sure that Dr. Boetel is quite knowledgeable in his specialty and probably pretty good at what he does. However, one of the critical components of medicine is caring, which he is undoubtedly missing. Theodore Roosevelt said, "" Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care."" I think that Dr. Boetel would be served well to learn this quote and relate it to the patients he sees.
Dr. Boetel's bedside manner with me was poor. He was dismissive of my complaints, failed to listen to me, and dismissed my ongoing pain. I came into the office seeking relief from my pain and answers on how this could be improved, but instead, I was left feeling dismissed, unworthy of care, confused, and angry.
I thought the care was poorly handled and that he was pretty rude. I hope that my review is helpful when choosing a provider for your spine issues.|Don't bother, Dr. Tom Botel, has no time for your issues and has very limited knowledge of Spine rehabilitation, associated pain or potential spine related medical problems. Further more he has interest in taking time with you or running further testing, to eliminate  potential conditions. He is basically  a pump you out collect his money, Doctor.  It's an Extreme waste of time to even visit with him. It's really sad so many Doctors are now this way. You'll  spend more time checking in, filling out unnecessary paperwork,  that he doesn't read anyhow, than actual time , visiting with him. Suggest you look elsewhere for someone to even try to help you with your Spine issues as of 02/12/2024|Starting with the courteous receptionist when first walking in that day, each staff member Nurse's, x-ray technician, doctor's assistant, and others) presented themselves in a positive, professional manner. I also appreciated the cleanliness of the waiting room and examination rooms. You all did a thorough job, and although I felt lousy at the time, it was apparent you all worked well together. A special thanks to the doctor for taking extra time to methodically and accurately diagnose the problems and what he was doing step by step. The Nursing Staff and Support was amazing I cannot express enough the compassion and Care . Take Care all of you. Top Notch Staff

God Bless each and everyone of you!|I have fibromyalgia. But I have always had spine issues. He didn't bother considering that it may actually be my a spine issue that's causing my pain. He stuck dry needles in my neck muscles, even when i told him it really hurt. I had a huge bump on my neck were he had stuck a dry needle. This made my pain much worse. I feel like he really just does not care! I also had an MRI before seeing him. It showed a herniated disk. I don't feel like he read my chart.|Not a very good Dr. didnt care about how much pain I am in. Told me to consider a different job if I cant handle my job I have due to pain & didnt even touch my back to figure out where the pain was coming from or see how i did with pain. Only saw the xrays & went by those. Wouldnt recommend him at all. You cant tell patients to deal with pain like they have for years. Just because I have had pain for 8 years doesnt mean I should have to deal with it for life.|Pleasant, very thorough, he listens to me and takes the time to answer my questions.

I would say I felt about 50% relief on the spot from his adjustment alone, and this was the turning point for the issue. My symptoms improved daily from that point on and I am now ready to train again. Dr. Wade has also been very accommodating to get me in on short notice when needed and he is always trying to fix the issue in as short of an amount of time as possible. Would recommend to anyone!|Dr. Wade is the best Chiropractor I've been to. He doesn't just crack and tell you to keep coming back, he understands that muscles need to release the tension as well. I won't see anyone else but him!|Dr. Wade,  has been an exceptional help to both my family and me. His attentive approach ensures personalized care for every visit. Unlike many others, his treatments are effective and often don't require frequent follow-ups. Highly recommend him for anyone seeking reliable chiropractic care!|I started going to Dr. Wade around 2014. I saw him several times at the start and I currently only go for maintenance treatments. His combination of deep tissue muscle work and chiropractic adjustment resolved the issues I was having.I've recommended him to several people who have become his patients. He is a professional that cares about people, not just his profession.  As much as I appreciate how much his treatments have helped me, I admire his care for people even more. He is a class act.|Dr. Wade is the best chiropractor to go to and get adjusted.  Dr. Wade listens to and genuinely cares about you and your health.  He will give you recommendations about going back for another adjustment but always says see how your feeling.

I was glad and even blessed that they got me in right away when I came back to the state;
However, it wasn't all good news. Understand this, my practitioner was the younger Andrew Keller. First thing he did was look at what I was on and say no you can't have this, this was after my Washington doctor and I have worked so hard to find what is workable for my spinal issues. I guess I should've taken mediate Relief and then jump shipped to another practitioner, but I didn't realize I was being set up to fail. I did tell the man it would not work with all of my heart, depression, and all the other little issues I got going on that are spurred on by the extreme levels of pain.
Seems to me that I was set up to fail because today when I went in for my regular appointment, he already had his mind made up. It didn't matter how much pain I was in even though it was worse than it's been since I've been in the state for the last six months.
I was simply told you received no medication. I can't help you because you use more than what I gave you.
Riddle me this Batman; ""if you reduced my daily allowance beyond my daily need and then give me more than what my 28 day allowance is, Is it justice to expect me to not eat those other four while I am in terrible pain and not able to sleep, shower or dress.
Really ?!!  ( sadly, Set up to fail I believe).
All I can say, my friends is consumer beware, and be guarded as you go forward.
Didn't bring in his little computer to our meet either, so I told him I would like to remind him of how that first meeting went.  Was not interested in the least. Already had the mind made up as to how things would go.
Not compassionate care. But ""C.Y.A as we do the minimal so as to keep cash flow happening"".
My fault, should have known better, as soon as care from previous practitioner was disregarded and cut back.|Dr. Mark Jones and his staff are wonderful.  He is a very a intelligent man and always explains things in a way that I fully understand.  He pretty much saved me from a miserable life of pain  so that I can function.

Even though I verified when I made the apt weeks ago.

ETA. Yes the day of the appointment the facility called 4 items in 2 hours while I was asleep. Presumably to tell me THE DAY OF they couldn't take my meds. When I answered the last call I was told it was an insurance question. So the person calling me relentlessly didn't even know what for. Your staff verified you took my medication the day Inmade the apt. Three weeks prior. Which was false information because you dont take it. Then your staff didn't know why they were calling me 4 times in 2 hours. Your staff is the issue. 1 of 5 star rating stands. I'd give less for only giving half the story in your reply.|I've been going here for several years, outlasting more than one FNP, and have been reasonably happy.  However, the most recent change, was a bridge too far.  The person they stuck me with, is a jerk!  My first visit with him, he ignored what came out of my mouth - in response to HIS questions.  I was shocked, as I've mostly been treated well there.  It was so bad, and uncomfortable, I chose not to return... EVER!

I  cannot understand how Tony got this job, he has zero people skills, and his conversation/language skills, have no place in a professional setting, yet alone a Dr.'s office.  I'm well aware he went to College, as he managed to become a Family Nurse Practitioner, but he spoke like a thug.  I am not exaggerating here, and was appalled.  It is a shame really, since I had few complaints before this, not zero complaints, but only a few.  My last visit, literally, my LAST visit... was a train wreck in Tony's hands.  It was so bad, I vowed then and there not to return, and I haven't, nor will I ever again.

My single star rating, is aimed squarely at Tony, the rest of the  STAFF was wonderful.  Not unlike other reviews here, the dealings with the Owner's husband, were hit and miss, and often pretty difficult to tolerate.  But I cannot say enough good things about the staff itself, and regret that they are unable to keep their FNP's happy enough for them to stay, since their turnover rate is pretty high.

This is an honest review of my own experience at this pain clinic, it has nothing to do with my medication, and up until two months ago, I had no intention of leaving, but a single visit with their newest FNP Tony, soured me on ever returning.  ONE VISIT!

ETA: The recently posted review, was written several years ago, when Tony DID work there.  I'm uncertain why this review was just recently publishe, and it certainly isn't in response to Michael and Debbie's recent legal issues.

However, I do indeed have the correct establishment and expect the DOJ to fully prosecute the Cox's for their deceptive business practices.|I have been coming to CPI for quite some time and I will continue to do so! They are awesome !! From the front desk and all the way back, everyone is very kind and considerate. Always smiling and friendly. I have never had to wait very long to be seen and they listen to me!! I have never had a bad experience with them and I would highly recommend them to anyone who has pain issues. I LOVE YOU GUYS, YOU'RE THE BEST!!!|This business is very professional.  We have access to the owners if there is ever a situation, which I think is a very good trait. . The office manager and staff handle the business part very professionally as well.  Out of the pain mgts I've attended, I rate this one five stars!  The office is very clean and comfortable for the patients.   Thank you so much Michael and Debbie Cox for providing an excellent service in Clarksville, TN and surrounding areas! They also make it easy to get your prescription filled by having a pharmacy right next door.  They thought about us, the patients.  

Thank you again. .  You all do a GREAT JOB!|My husband hates writing reviews, am writing his with my touch. In 2018, I chose to come to this place, heard they were strict yet also cared about the clients.
My first appointment I was assigned to Megan, to us in our book, a hero! Megan literally saved my life, a botched surgery, with a deadly rare blood infection, had no clue at the time in my spine it was growing worse,  I was dying. Megan wasn't happy, highly concerned it wasn't good, a few more hours of not rushing to the ER., I wouldn't be here,  my husband & I will always see her as my hero.
Ok:
The second reason, a place we could trust to treat my many complexed health pain problems, we needed someone knowledgeable, not once has it disappointed us throughout the years.

The front office, to the  back office & technicians who wear many hats, all special to my heart, each treat me with respect even though I can be annoying at times, there is not one mean person whom works here, makes it easier dealing on my worst painful days.

Dr.Brandon Tolman, he is the first doctor since I became chronically sick after 46 surgeries, gave us full attention of listening to our concerns, actually evaluated my X-rays and shared his extensive knowledge and options, really took his time to answer ALL my husbands questions not rushing us out the door, we really never had a doctor who explained my condition and options, really impressed he knew my case & upcoming surgeries.

I'm looking forward to my first epidural here for pain. We highly  recommend coming here, a straight forward doctor who is kind, knowledgeable, and treated us like human beings.

We thank each whom works here, can not say enough great words of work ethics!!! Empathetic, caring, you won't find anywhere else.
If you truly need help, this is the place! 10 stars in our book!!!|I was just dismissed from this clinic. So why 5 stars? It wasn't their fault. I think this has to be the best clinic. Very clean, everyone I encountered was so super nice to me. I have seen both nurses, they are both so nice it would be hard to say one I like the best. Very professional as well. Truly an honor to have been seen there. Oh, and i thought the waiting room chairs were comfortable! lol.|After a very harrowing experience with another local pain clinic, I diligently searched for another. After reading the great reviews for the Pain Institute of Clarksville, I chose to go to them. It was a decision that I will never regret. The atmosphere is very comforting and pleasant. All employees are kind and caring. They get to know you and are knowledgeable about your case. There are strict guidelines, as there should be. I, myself, appreciate it. Times are very hard for true chronic pain patients. I highly recommend coming here if you are. A special thank you for Ashley.|I've been a patient here for several years. I've never encountered or had a bad experience here. The staff are helpful, remember and greet current patients by name, something you don't see very often these days. Most healthcare clinics don't bother to try and remember patients. We are simply numbers to most of them. The rules of this clinic are strictly enforced and made clear to every patient. As a patient, the staff and my provider listen to my issues and I feel respected. Respect is something that chronic pain patients rarely encounter. The provider I have now is hands down the best I've ever had. She addresses needs as they arise, and makes sure that I have access to all non-narcotic and alternative therapies offered at the clinic. This clinic provides many alternative therapies, from trigger point injections to a new, and very effective, neuragenex therapy. A pain clinic is the last place I ever thought I would end up in, but when general providers refuse to listen to or even attempt to address chronic pain, there aren't many other options. Years later, I could not have come to a better place. I would recommend this clinic to anyone without reservation.",2024-09-04|2018-07-25|2022-04-16|2019-07-29|2022-06-02|2019-12-05|2020-10-27|2022-02-26,1|1|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|1 p.m.",77.25|76.5|70,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do u need a referral ?","Yes and is the best in Clarksville",pain_management_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ1xRqB0rZZIgRL3yGW3_hTbw,120

Its a small (6th)floor of a hospital that uses actual hospital rooms. The atmosphere was unsettling. I arrived on time however, it took me 8 mins to find a parking spot and to actually get to the 6th floor. The nurse was so rude to me, smirking a making rude comments about me being late that they probably wont see me but i could wait if i wanted to be worked in. The 3 women that do the paperwork and reception were all ugly and rude to me. Im there to get an epidural in my neck. Thats it.  But, they treated me like i was garbage. After 2 hours of patiently waiting i calmly got up and left. I hope noone else gets treated so poorly by so called professionals.|Great spine doctor I have gotten cortisone shots , epidural and Rf ablations have had amazing results and been 100% better than my back condition before and has worked mabye as 10 yr of visits.

Doctor Dreskin Is really nice and remembers everything about his patience. They're willing to help and listen to any concerns whether this is new to you like it is for me or for people who have been dealing with this for a long time.

Dr. Bajwa Is very kind and also very knowledgeable. Truly feels like they care and want what's best for you.

The 2 lady's at the front are very kind and helpful. Danielle and the rest of the staff are all wonderful, kind, and helpful as well. I highly recommend this practice.|Carley is so very compassionate. She takes time with you to listen to your concerns and tries to accommodate all reasonable requests. She is professional with a very loving bedside manner. We love Carley.|Was there today after a long absence due to medical issues.  Carly is my contact and she is a very good counselor and sweet person.

I read a comment about a unhappy customer online.  My experience has been nothing but excellent for four years off and on that I have been going.  No place better in my years of 84 years of doctors.|I really like Dr. Dreskin but the medical assistants and other staff members do not care about the patients. I needed a pre-authorization for a prescription. The first time, it was filled out incorrectly. I called and specifically told them what the insurance company needed. Second time, it isn't completely filled out again. Now either they aren't very smart or just don't care!!!! Either way, it's ridiculous that a place dealing with chronic pain patients can't make sure they can get their meds. Just a warning!
I will be finding another pain managment facility to help me. The receptionists aren't friendly at all and the guy who counts your meds, if he grunts at you, you're lucky. Not a welcoming place at all. If Dr. Dreskin had a new staff, I'd stay with him.|Stay away from TN Valley Pain Management - go see a real doctor! My father had an epidural in his lumbar spine here and they wanted to do twilight anesthesia and ask he not drive to or from the procedure. Well, I have had three of the same procedures and know that is not required. The proper procedure is a local anesthetic and can be done in an office setting. This place is a scam and only enables patients, but not to get better.|This place is great the receptionist are very nice. Carley Mccloskey is an awesome practitioner I can't say enough good things about all the staff highly recommend.|I had my referral sent to Amanda. I tried calling 3 times. Then she called asking for another person. I said no, but I was looking to talk to her. She gave me baloney that I was the next person on her list to call. Yeah, okay. She then said she didn't get the referral. I called my old pain clinic again, and waited on the phone until they got the fax confirmation back, which they did. I asked about the first referral, and the clerk confirmed that, yes, they had the first confirmation, as well. I called Amanda back. Waited two more days for her to say she didn't have it. Oh, but she checked everywhere for it. Uh-huh. This place is unprofessional, and Amanda is incompetent! If you're looking for a pain clinic, I'd suggest you try another one. Obviously, these people are so busy, and lose your referrals to boot, they don't want new business. I'm granting their wish and will find another place that actually  will do their job!|My sister was referred to this clinic by our PCP to see Dr. Dreskin. She has chronic pain, that includes but not limited to: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Blounts disease (bone disease), Diabetic Neuropathy, CKD and is on dialysis. The doctor walked in and immediately explained that they don't prescribe opioids (we didn't ask for opioids). He exclaimed ""if I broke every bone in my body, I wouldn't touch opioids."" He didn't offer any other options and said if she was already taking hydrocodone, then the clinic policy was not to prescribe and that he'd have to refer her to another clinic in Cleveland TN. They didn't even TRY to talk alternative options. In and out in less than 3 minutes. The little blonde haired nurse was no better. I'm flummoxed.

We also heard from other patients that this same clinic prescribed hydrocodone and oxycodone so why they'd lie to us is beyond me. I'm assuming he looked at a trio of black women and assumed she was looking for pills like a junkie. WRONG. My sister hates taking pills but she's in pain all day everyday, her pain threshold never goes below a 4. Pain Management is not just about opioids and that he didn't even discuss alternatives is very disappointing. Do NOT come to this clinic. This doctor Dreskin is offering treatment based off his personal opinions without consideration for individual patients.

It was not successful and has been a very long journey.  Someone recommended Dr. Newton and after just 2 visits, I am already having positive results.   I feel very comfortable with him, he explains everything clearly and makes sure I understand what the objective is for my treatment.  I highly recommend him.  He's very knowledgeable, helpful and understanding.  He and his staff are great!!|My referring orthopedic doctor sent my referral to your office 12/29. I never got a call so a week later I called the office and left a voicemail.  A few more days passed and I never got a call so I called again but got the voicemail.  Finally,  2 weeks after my referral was sent over, on my 3rd call in I got someone on the phone and asked to make my appointment for the cervical injection I needed. I spoke to a receptionist who was less than friendly with borderline rude phone etiquette.  So, a couple weeks later here's how my appointment went.
I arrived today at 8:55. My appointment was at 9:00. I was greeted by a sign at the window that states, Be advised: ""Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.""  Along with a sign saying New Patients must arrive 30 minutes early and existing patients must arrive 15 minutes early. I had no clue of this policy. I gave the front desk lady my name and was given the 5th degree by the receptionist.  She stated to me that her manager told me to arrive 30 minutes early.  I have no memory of being told that whatsoever and whoever answered the phone when I made my appointment was not the manager. The lady at the window then asked me if I wanted her to ask Dr. Newton IF he still wanted to see me. Like, what???!!!??? A couple minutes later she returned and asked me if I'd like to ""wait and just be worked in."" I asked her what the reason was why I needed to be here 30 minutes early when I had already filled out ALL my new patient forms online and had even uploaded my ID and insurance card. The only answer she provided was that it is Dr. Newton's policy. No logical or reasonable response.
I sat down and began to wait and wait...and wait. At 9:25  a woman walked in for her 9:30 appointment.  I asked the woman if she liked Dr. Newton and she said it was her first visit. The lady at the front desk said ZERO words to her. At 9:51 she was called back and I was still waiting.  I walked out. I will never return.  I wasted an hour of MY because of your ridiculous, unfriendly and unwelcoming policy. Absolutely stupid practice. Referrals by word of mouth go ask long way. I'll be spreading the word to warn others about this Dr. and his silly little practice...|Very unprofessional and lacking in moral integrity. The lab they use has really bad reviews and several lawsuits as well. My husband came here for chronic pain management and got nothing but a very hard time. Defamation of character on my husband's name. All is being looked into with the lab and office staff!

First, I would like to thank you for responding to my review; however for me to even leave a bad review something is wrong. My husband was targeted and he will not speak up for himself. I however will; The test was an oral swab and he also was given a urinalysis. Now I spoke to Aegis myself and they confirmed that the drug that my chronic pain husband was positive for a substance; and there has been up to a 10% fail rate. Not all of your patients is given an oral swab it has to be requested. Now I know and your office staff do to my husband and along with a few others were targeted and if you just wanted to discharge him that is fine but to lie on his character is another. Not to be brutally honest he was short a few meds 1 time not twice but he had confided in one of the providers about break through pain meds! He never got a chance to discuss it again. The office staff is rude; well most! I thought the provider would be a good fit for my husband's pain control. Whom by the way never took an aspirin until he got sick. So yes; I will defend him and others like him and have this looked into. Maybe a better system with office staff needs to be put in place. Have a great day!|The office staff was amazing the nurse in the office was kind and patient she listened to all my health concerns.
The staff at the hospital before during and after my injection were wonderful,  very professional and personal also.
Julie the procedure room nurse is amazing with good music playing and very personal as is the surgical tech working the x-ray with DR. Newton. Well done.
DR. Newton was amazing telling me exactly what he was doing, it was very relaxing to me hearing these 3 professionals working together.  I hope I don't have to see them again soon but I do know when I have to have another injection it is done with the same professionalism and pride as the 1st.
Thanks again,
Dan|If you have a bad review here. Then you are the problem. In and out within 10 minutes each time. Pre registration online.

He does a super job of explaining my medical issues and always treat me like I'm his most important patient. Always a great experience.|I feel my husbands pain was not taken seriously when he was not able to get his prescription filled bc of needing insurance pre authorization and the pharmacy saying they would have to order it. We went back to speak with the doctor about getting something else that was available without jumping through hoops and he was pretty much dismissed with no concern for his pain. When someone has chronic pain that is debilitating it also affects their mind and thoughts and attitude. He was so distraught about not getting his prescription, after waiting months for this appointment, I feel like more time could have been taken to understand what he was going through the dr could have taken a few minutes of his time to speak with us again and figure out a different plan. Instead his nurse came out and completely dismissed him and what he is going through. I had high hopes and am very disappointed that now we have to start over again to try to get him help|Everyone are so nice & helpful, and I am grateful that Dr Dodus is my doctor.

The entire staff is very friendly, as well! Overall, this is a great physician's office!|I have several issues with deterioration of the spine and am not a candidate for extensive surgery. My Specialist recommended ablations of the nerves in both upper and lower spine. He agreed to let me get those treatments locally and referred me to this facility. Dr. Black and his staff have been super  in providing my treatments from thorough explanations to kind and attentive treatment and service.

He has a way of making my fears go away and I feel that he will help me in anyway he can to ease the pain. I can't begin to say how kind everyone has been. If anyone is getting ready to go to Rhea Medical Pain Management, you can rest easy that you will be treated with the utmost respect, kindness and professionalism.|I feel like this man is very unprofessional. Sort of a legal scam. He tells you a shots going to make you feel better. What he doesn't tell you other than it could cause an infection. Is the shot will cause scar tissue. And then you have to have a procedure done for that. And the shot he gives you is very temporary so then you got to have another one and they tell you all your insurance will cover it it's affordable is are not affordable these procedures cost and why I had to have two to three visits in his office before even getting one shot with no medicine being written made no sense they racked me up in bills. And he was willing to give me injections in me and neck as well not telling me what would happen after those I'm sure more stuff that would need in minor surgeries just seems very unprofessional I hope this is not a legal scam|I  highly recommend Chelsea she's GREAT!

I'm so blessed  Chelsea is helping me with my health issues.|It took more than a month to get in for a follow up appointment. Once there, I spent three and a half hours waiting to be called back, with my feral two year old son, just to wait nearly another hour for the doctor to come in. He spent five minutes in the room with me, did not listen to any of my concerns or complaints, and sent me home with a prescription that did more harm than good! My next appointment, another month after I needed to be in, was worse. He wanted to put me on a medication similar to the one that gave me problems just to see if that one would work. He refused to prescribe me a medication that I already had been on and knew worked. He was (and is) more interested in using his patients as test subjects and making money off of them and their insurance than providing proper medical care to decrease or end chronic pain! I marked one star out of five because I couldn't submit my review without a rating.

When I called them about what was going on when I cancel the appointment they said that's find just call back when he gets feeling better to reschedule his appointment then I get that letter today. I really think that was so unprofessional of them not even call me to come in and talk to them or nothing they have treated me like I am a not even person just another number to them to collect from my insurance because they just wanted to do shots on me and I did due some of the shots in my back and it didn't even help.

The first time they didn't even give the pharmacy the basic info needed to fill it. When it was about to run out, they wanted to change dosage. It was to be done a week ago but they have still to do it. No biggie, who needs something to relieve the pain anyway.
Secondly, they don't listen to the patient. I've had numerous steroid shots and none have worked. Their answer?Lets do more of what we know won't work.
I asked them to get records from previous doctors. Not a chance. Why would they when they can ignore me and schedule more procedures so they can make more money?
If you want a place where they care about the patients, this is not the place. They're only interested in keeping you coming back to make more money.
If the lady would spend as much time getting my prescriptions correct as she does praying, I might not be in as much pain.
Will they apologize for their incompetence and greed? Of course not. No money to be made there. Will I hear from them to remove this review? Probably, but it's not happening.|As a Christian woman to have such a caring and positive and professional expertise from the staff as well as compassion for each patient is a rare thing.

I now look forward to bettering my life with less pain and a healthier lifestyle. I would definitely recommend friends,  family and anyone who needs help to relieve their pain to contact them. I came away encouraged, hopeful, and ready to change my path!|Connie was so helpful, getting my records transferred. Dr. Baker and Cammie are a great team.  During my new patient visit, Dr. Baker listened and provided education regarding my medications. He spent the time needed and was very thorough. I am so happy to have found this practice, office staff are friendly!|Dr Baker and his staff have always been extremely understanding.  In the event you need a procedure they take time to explain everything to you including any other options available.
I have been a patient going on eight years nothing but positive experiences.  Dr Baker is the only surgeon I trust with a needle around my spine
I would highly recommend anyone|I've been going to Tennessee Physical Therapy and Pain Management for about ten years now. I've read thru some of the reviews posted here and I can't believe there are negative comments. I have never experienced anything but friendliness & professionalism by their staff. Dr. Baker is an outstanding Physician. He takes his time, actually listens and then gives recommendations. Every PA I have been assigned to has been/is top notch. The nurses are the same. I have zero complaints.

I have come across people who have told me they didn't like going there. Unfortunately, it was their fault they had negative experiences. Dr. Baker and crew do not play when it comes to following the rules and expectations of being a patient at that office. If I had gone to Medical School and spent years of my time and energy to help people, I'd be damned if I'd put my livelihood on the line for a patient that refuses to take meds as prescribed, caught selling, can't pass random urine tests, etc...but that's just me!  (sorry for that run on sentence)

I appreciate their efforts!!|I have been a patient of Dr Baker for about a year and have found him and his staff to be very helpful and accommodating with my chronic pain issues! They have proved to be very caring and helpful in managing my pain. I've been to a few other Doctors but his treatment is the best so far!|The folks at Tennessee pain management are a great group of folks.  Dr. Joy has a lovely spirit and attitude at every visit.  They never make you wait for too long and the front staff is super friendly as well! I highly recommend!|My wife and I Have been patients of Dr Baker on & off for 26+ years. Usually a very positive experience. We have loved this man. Office staff is horrible especially financial secretary. They repeat untruths to Baker. This past week I was having chest pains (I am a heart patient) while in the lobby. My wife told the office staff and Dr Baker that I was having chest pains. Neither staff nor Dr Baker asked ""is he ok, do you need an ambulance""? Not even offer to take bp. Comment was made ""care and co-pay is due at time of service""! We left going to ER!

Our co-pay should always be $45 and that's fine. Some months office staff will say ""your balance is $5 or, your balance is $50""! We have  even gone months with credits. We have NEVER owed this Dr anything. We pay whatever they say. We learned a long time ago if you question why the balance is different each month the financial secretary considers this a personal attack. They have become increasingly aggressive and offensive. This visit,  the office staff shouts through the glass windows, (with at least 7 patients in lobby) our history of financial information. We were shook and in shock that office staff could be so unprofessional and uncaring. She should have called us in the back to say what she needed to say. Dr Baker took the untrue words of office staff without respecting us enough to speak with us. After 26 years of patient/doctor relationship. We are so very disappointed with the integrity of not only a man, but a Dr. A Dr that took an oath to ""do no harm""! Me having chest pains in his lobby was of ZERO concern!!
Doctors are a dime a dozen and of course we can choose another. It's the RELATIONSHIP that we will miss.|Great team of folks who listen and care for pain management patients!

The ablations I have had [one side in December and one side in January] - I have pain relief! I still have to take oral medication but gosh - I feel so much better with Dr. Baker's team. Folks answer questions and explains things to me in a manner I can understand.

The staff was very caring to the patient needs. The doctor that cared for me always  took the time to talk to me before the procedure took place. I think that is very important to be known by all the patients. I was very satisfied with the service. Thank you|If you are young, do not go to this place. They treat everyone like drug seekers and will withhold findings from scans in order to not treat you. After asking for copies of my reports from the radiologist, the looks on their faces showed that they did not want to give them to me really. My report included a NEW finding of multiple degenerative spinal nodes that have never been noted before. While these types of nodes are common, combined with my chronic degenerative disease, that's pretty significant and yields at least some discussion. They just weren't going to tell me about the nodes and send me on my way with nothing but a surgical option that I will not do. I can't trust you to even tell the truth. Why would I want a procedure? Dr. Smith judged my issues with needles (a strong trauma-based phobia combined with sensory issues due to autism)  and nearly rolled her eyes at my husband when he asked if there was a way to knock me out for the procedure before inserting an IV. She said no, but there are ways: gas and anti-anxiety meds among others, which have been offered to me at other places before.

They also neglected to tell me that I needed to bring a copy of my scans from the imaging center to my appointment with them (what place doesn't just send those anyway - I have been getting scans for 15 years now and have never had to bring my own copy) so they made all of these decisions to treat me horribly without even seeing my scans that make it very clear that I am telling the truth and am in a lot of very visible pain. Pass on this one. It's a money grab and Dr. Martha Smith can't be trusted at all. Her nurse practitioner actually cared about my pain and situation in the first appointment, but at the second, Dr. Smith clearly had squashed that. I will be taking my scans elsewhere for a more compassionate and honest opinion.|If you need pain relief from neck and back pain, I highly recommend Pain Consultants of East Tennessee.
Dr. Martha Smith is compassionate, knowledgeable, and has been highly successful in treating my neck pain and headaches for several years.

I felt very judged and I know they was not wanting to treat me .These clinics hold back pain medicine to push injection because they make more money, but they don't tell you that injection are making your back problem worse even though you feel better for a short time when the injection  no longer work and it time to start surgery's and probably several but if you what more pain med your a addict|I've had neurosarcoidosis for 21 years and have always struggled to be heard or taken seriously for the horrible pain in my chest due to this rare disease.

PCET and especially Dr. Choo (and his Nurse Practitioner) actually LISTENED to me and took my pain seriously.

I am thankful for finally finding a doctor who listens to chronic pain patients and advocates for them. They treat pain holistically, offering both physical and mental health services in-house.

The opioid crisis has made it very difficult for chronic pain patients to have their pain treated effectively.

Basically, all the drug seeking individuals looking for their next high have ruined it for patients who actually need opioids to have a decent quality of life.

I hope this review helps you to decide ..May everyone have a blessed day !!|I was a patient at the Dickson location and was pleased with my first visit for the care that was given. I went back for my second visit and we talked about different treatments that were available to me to think about. My regular prescription was called in to the drugstore I used only to find my medicine was on back order. I called the clinic to ask them to send my prescription over to another local drugstore that had my medication on hand. The recording on the nurses line said calls would be returned within 24 hours but sadly that wasn't true. Three different days I called in leaving one message a day about transferring my prescription but no one ever returned my calls. By now I was six days without my medication and had gone into withdrawals. I called one more time and told the person that answered the phone what had happened only to be told that she couldn't help me and transfered me to the nurse's line again where I had to leave another message! Later that day the receptionist called and said that they had sent a new prescription to the drugstore I last requested. When I went in for my next appointment at the clinic and saw the doctor and explained concern over what had happened the previous visit with my medication she told me that she had only received one message which was the last one I left and said perhaps I had left my messages on a non responsive line. I explained that I had called 3 previous times and that my messages were left on the nurse's voicemail. Again she brought up alternate methods for pain relief saying they didn't like to keep their patients on opioids. I explained that the dosage she had me on was not working and perhaps I was not getting the care that I required from this facility. I then asked for a release from them so I could go to another pain clinic to receive the care I needed. She went to get the release papers but gave them to her nurse to give to me instead of coming back in herself. I found this very offensive considering what all I had gone through. I was polite and when I was out in the hall I made a general statement thanking them all for their help. Sorry but someone who is 78 years old that had a knee replacement that had to be done twice within 5 days time, that also had osteoarthritis with degenerate joint and disc disease for over 25 years, that also has stress fractures in their lumbar and spine and is now in stage 4 of severe osteoporosis, I can not recommend this facility to anyone in severe pain.|My wife had an appointment at the Dickson office and the doctor and most of the staff were very courteous and professional!  I say ""most"" of the staff, because the receptionist (I think she said her name was Meagan) was rude and not courteous or respectful!  She needs training in how to speak respectfully to patients.|I just love going in there. It honestly is the best place to go as far as doctor's appointments. Megan, Jessica, and Mandi are some of the most professional and friendly people I know in the medical field. They have really helped me a great deal. They really know their stuff. The Dickson office rocks!!! Thanks you guys for being awesome!!!|Mandi is great! She listens and tries to find the best solution to help with whatever pain you are having. The Dickson office has nothing but great people working in it.|I have seen several different pain doctors before. They usually go out of business, change Doctors's, or they can not seem to get the billing correct. Well Dr.Golamco has changed my pain management journey completely. She was willing to listen and come up with solutions that we could try and if they didn't work then she would try something else. I have had 3 injections for joint pain and she is so good I barely felt anything. Jessica her nurse is so sweet and always has a positive attitude. She's a hard working girl that gets her job done. Megan the front office worker is always on point with my appointments and my payments. I have monthly appointments and my insurance has been billed and my co-pay available before my next appointment. My payments versus my EOB's from my insurance carrier always matched. That's a big plus for me! The Nurse Practitioner Mandy is very nice and was my mom's provider before she passed away. Thank you for doing a good job!|Good people!  Dr. Golamco and Nurse Jessica are a great team.  I always feel I have had their fullest attention and very best efforts to help me manage long-term spinal issues.  Dr. G LISTENS -- and Jessica makes me laugh about something every visit, while providing seriously excellent care.  Wonderful attitudes!|First I must talk about my health care provider Mandi.
She is absolutely wonderful. She's always upbeat, pleasant and very helpful and informative. What a pleasure it is to have found such an outstanding N.P.. I don't believe they come any better!!!!
My nurse Mary Ellen is also quite a treasure. She's always friendly and laughs at my lame jokes and she is polite and friendly.  I couldn't ask for a better nurse. Thanks!!
Now for the downside.
This last month I was scheduled for an epidural. When found out my cost I immediately canceled the procedure. Thus left myself without meds for the month. So I called the office, left a message and received nothing in reply. So over the next 3 weeks I left messages 5 times asking for help each time. And I received absolutely nothing in way of a reply.. So in frustration I made the 70mi round trip to the office which I hated to do as it costs about $20 which I struggle to come up with, hence the unreturned phonecards.
I got immediate help thank goodness. But I have to say that the corporation that runs these offices leaves an awful lot to be desired in terms of how well this operation is run.

She is a gem and a rare find in regard to pain management care. I have a tumor in my spinal cord that cannot be removed because it is embedded in my nerves and would paralyze me. Valentines Day 2022 I was blindsided with the news that I would need emergency surgery. I had trouble walking and using my arms afterward. After weeks of physical therapy I was sent to a different pain man agent clinic. Let's just say that I was treated like a drug seeking addict and talked to very ugly. When I found Ashley it was like a breath of fresh air. She listened and was kind and caring. I believe I cried on my first visit because she was so wonderful. Ashley has given me alternate plans for my pain. My pain is something I will live with forever but she has made it manageable.  I would follow Ashley anywhere! She is a real godsend!!! I could not make it without Ashley - she is that important to me!|I cannot say enough great things about Dr. Prichard - she is absolutely amazing! After years of struggling with chronic pain and going through various pain management programs, Dr. Prichard has been an absolute game-changer for me. Her level of expertise, compassion, and dedication to her patients is truly unparalleled. From the moment I met her, I knew I was in good hands. She took the time to listen to my concerns, thoroughly evaluate my condition, and develop a personalized treatment plan that has significantly improved my quality of life. Under her care, I have experienced relief like never before. I am so grateful for Dr. Prichard's commitment to helping individuals like myself find relief from pain and regain control over their health. She truly is a shining star in the field of medicine!|I went to the office today I was pleasantly surprised all of the employees especially Cheryl and Jamie, were so kind and everyone was smiling and very happy and so kind and very helpful.

She is always kind and consistently has helped me with chronic back pain. I recently had an issue with another health concern and even went to an orthopedic surgeon that got me absolutely nowhere. During my visit with Ashley just a few days later, I told her about the issue and within 2 days she had me in to get a nerve study and I am now scheduled for surgery for the issue. I truly believe that I would have kept searching for answers without being given concrete belief in my pain, getting into the nerve study so quickly, & finally being scheduled for surgery. If I could give both Ashley and her nurse, Faith, 10 stars each, I would! Both of them have been so helpful and kind to me. I'm eternally grateful for their willingness to listen, their kindness, their assistance in facilitating getting me help in other areas of my healthcare, and their attention to detail on paperwork that I've had to submit for short term disability and FMLA.

I'm Very Thankful for her and ALL of her help with my care!|I have 80% 3rd degree burns w/chronic pain & nerve damage. It's not about feeling zero pain at all times. That's how addiction happens. It's about taking the least amount of meds to make your life manageable & restore positive moments. I can't express enough how much gratitude I have for Ashley Prichard & her care. Pain management has such a bad connotation associated w/it. Having scheduled pain meds that are moderated lets me live my life to a fuller extent, & that is worth absolutely everything. I had surgery about 10 days ago to be told by the hospital I wasn't in pain. I had ""anxiety"" & nothing was given by the hospital for home. They said I had worse surgeries (so essentially you'll get over it). It was horrible. I've been burned since I was 2. I know when I'm in pain. I called the clinic who fixed it. I turned around & had a 2nd surgery 5 days later for Ashley to be in knowledge of. Today, another 5 days later, is the first time I've been able to get up & out. My family came from Louisiana to support & bc of the meds I was able to sit/stand enough for splatter painting & have a family day. That is irreplaceable. That's what pain mang is about. It's not about getting what you think you should. It's restoring baseline quality of Iife for me. W/o proper meds, it would never have happened. I'm extremely grateful for the care here. She listens & responds appropriately. Visits can be short & predictable if nothing new is on the table which I appreciate, or they can be as long as you need to discuss things. People not liking the front desk people, have a sense of humor & do the right thing & you'll be fine. All positive here :)|I have been having pain and numbness in my arm and neck.

I have been in a suboxone program for a real long time with  another Doctor and I was afraid that I was not going to get help with my pain because of that but I was wrong. When I went back to see Cheryl she was wonderful. She listened and told me what she could do for me. Then I was fortunate again that Dr Schneider was in his office and he came in to talk with me. He examine me and said that he would do test to find out what was wrong in my arm and what was causing the numbness. He was nothing but great. He perscribe a medication that did't interfere with any other medication I already take.  Cheryl is going to give me a shot in my neck that will help with the pain also.

When the doctor finally came in the room and asked if I was ready, I said calmly that I had been ready for a hour. He went off on me and said that I had attacked his employees (even though I only calmly spoke to one employee) and continued to speak harshly to me about how disrespectful it was for me to come into his business, the one I paid for, and disrespect him and his employees. To avoid continued altercation, I calmly said I meant no disrespect and even apologized. He continued to speak to me very harshly and told me I could take my business elsewhere. I told him I just wanted to receive the procedure I had paid for and not hold him up any longer. It seemed he just wanted to argue. Part of me wanted to walk away, but I refused, after paying them, to give him the satisfaction of leaving. I was getting an injection in my spine which I had to be sedated for. He didn't wait for the sedation to fully kick in as I could feel the needle going into my neck. This doctor is a hack.

Additionally, they did not make me feel stigmatized - as I was on a fairly high dose of opiates.  They were able to convert and step down my IV medications and transition to oral meds to facilitate my release and ability to manage my pain at home.

He works with me as a whole person, not just the ""body part"" he's treating. I've been treating by Dr Young approximately 3+ years or so I can't imagine having any Orthopedic treat me by choice. I highly recommend him to anyone in the Murfreesboro area, but will say, I drove to keep him when I was living in Mt Juliet for over a year. It was worth the drive to be treated professionally and with respect & dignity. His nurse Lauren and Front desk staff, Jill, are both AMAZING and have that same sense of compassion,  are so welcoming. Stephan, also at the front desk, whom I not dealt with as often as Jill, is also welcoming, and kind as can be! Great doctor with great staff!!|Dr Young did a thorough initial assessment, explained his findings and reviewed the radiographs, and then made treatment recommendations including the use of models to demonstrate exactly what the procedure would involve.

Im in 10/10 pain from 5 slipped discs.  I go visit Dr Dreskil (sp?).  He begins to tell me that he doesnt do opioids over and over from the beginning like im a drug addict. I tell him over and over thats not why im here.  I in pain just fix it.  Dont care what I take at this point.  He gives me a nerve pill prescription on friday and tells me to call him monday if its not doing the job and we can adjust. COOL.  After suffering all weekend, I call Monday morning at 8am and get pushed to his voicemail.  I call back Tuesday at 9am and again at 3pm leaving a message both times.  I call again on Wednesday at 9am frustrated and talk to the office manager then this doc.  They tell me every excuse under the sun.  ( had an emergency to deal with, I didnt get your messages, I only see 1 message ). I tell the doc that MY situation is an emergency too.  Its affecting every single thing in my life.  He spends 2 min on the phone with me and tells me to double my meds.  Was that so hard?  120 seconds on the phone.  So I call him today which is 2/10 at 8am and leave another message.  I call back at 1130 am and show my frustration to the front desk and get transferred to my doc.  He tells me that there really isnt anything else he can do bc I take delta 8 ( per my doc for my pain ) and then he tells me that he will just refer me to another place that does opiods.  WHAT THE HECK??!!??  I didnt say one word about pain pills.  This dude is Looney.  I wouldnt go to him if he was the last doc on the face of the planet.  This dude just wants to sell a certain pain solution for whatever reason but he is terrible and not nice to deal with  and just tries to talk over you like your not smart and he is superior.  Will never be back here ever again.|Had my first visit today at the Hixson office, and I am genuinely flabbergasted looking at some of these negative reviews. Dr. Dreskin has to be one of the nicest, and seemingly most genuine, doctors I've seen so far in my autoimmune struggle. Straightforward, non-judgemental, and reassuring. I'm beyond excited to start my journey with this office!|Dr. Dreskin is a dismissive and judgmental man. I was referred to Tennessee Valley pain management by my PCP. There is nothing more I hate than telling a doctor that I'm in pain. I have a complicated past. The cause of my pain is due to repeated physical trauma to my body for decades and injuring myself several times while working. Not only has that left my body traumatized but my mental health as well. In 2023 I had A trimalleolar fracture which is a break in three parts of the ankle joint: the lateral malleolus, the medial malleolus, and the posterior malleolus. It's the least common type of ankle fracture. The surgery was terrible. My foot was put back on my leg internally by plates and many screws and pins. I was on pain medication for 5 months. Non-weight bearing for 6 months. I wasn't weaned off the medication and was told I should do an outpatient detox which used suboxone to deal with the symptoms that I would have from abruptly stopping the high doses I had been on. I'm not sure why doctors don't wean people off of medication that causes these symptoms when the medication is abruptly stopped but I'm starting to think it has to do with money. I'm putting this all out there because Dr. Dreskin asked me what has caused my pain but never listened to my answer. He kept cutting me off after a few words. He asked why I had been on suboxone in the past. I started to tell him and he again cut me off. He had no idea where I was in pain other than a piece of paper with a picture of a body on it and I had that was from a pack of papers I was given when I first got there. I never even got past the first page before he told me there was nothing he could do for me.  He asked me if I was on mental health medication. He asked if had a psychiatrist. I was confused. I have my mental trauma handled. I was referred to him to help me with my pain until I was either surgically fixed or fixed with physical therapy. He had his mind made up about who I was before he ever saw me. I don't matter because somewhere on some piece of paper was a red flag and I didn't matter. I see other doctors and honestly, it seems to me that none of them want to treat me. What I tell them doesn't matter. I'm just a name on a folder  with a red flag on it and I'm not worth the paperwork or risk to medically treat but he will mentally treat me. He's probably got something worked out with a psychiatrist friend or a cute pharmaceutical rep.
What is a person's choices?  What's next?|Funniest thing 4 years of chronic pain and best he could do is epidurals that worked about two weeks.Dreskin wants you to come in monthly to see how you feel and possibly schedule another epidural.What he will prescribe will put you down mentally and physically and once you think your heads clearedup  it'll leave you with a week of suicidal thoughts.Because he sent you to his buddy in Cleveland because you need mental health counseling and he put you on some bs.BE AWARE Then when you choose to leave he will put bs in you're charts.Leave this guy alone. Not to mention they'll send a notice that you owe them well after you've paid youre out of pocket 75 a month when I haven't been there in two months.Pay 35 on a 75 doller doctor's bill nexttime I come I owe 75 again.|Dr. Dreskin is amazing. He listens and gives you treatment that makes you comfortable. He fixed a very painful issue for me within minutes and I am so grateful.|My sister was referred to this clinic by our PCP to see Dr. Dreskin. She has chronic pain, that includes but not limited to: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Blounts disease (bone disease), Diabetic Neuropathy, CKD and is on dialysis. The doctor walked in and immediately explained that they don't prescribe opioids (we didn't ask for opioids). He exclaimed ""if I broke every bone in my body, I wouldn't touch opioids."" He didn't offer any other options and said if she was already taking hydrocodone, then the clinic policy was not to prescribe and that he'd have to refer her to another clinic in Cleveland TN. They didn't even TRY to talk alternative options. In and out in less than 3 minutes. The little blonde haired nurse was no better. I'm flummoxed.

We also heard from other patients that this same clinic prescribed hydrocodone and oxycodone so why they'd lie to us is beyond me. I'm assuming he looked at a trio of black women and assumed she was looking for pills like a junkie. WRONG. My sister hates taking pills but she's in pain all day everyday, her pain threshold never goes below a 4. Pain Management is not just about opioids and that he didn't even discuss alternatives is very disappointing. Do NOT come to this clinic. This doctor Dreskin is offering treatment based off his personal opinions without consideration for individual patients. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this clinic.|So I have to be honest about my experiences with this office. After reading the reviews I was very nervous to even show up for my first appointment but I did and everything went wonderful. They ask you lots of questions and the entire time apologized for the depth of questions they asked. They made sure that the plan that my previous doctor had me on was working somewhat and what he wanted to do. I have been seeing him for about 5 months now and the staff has been wonderful and the doctor and I are on the same page. Like he said in my first appointment, I do not care who you where seeing or what you have been prescribed in the past we will continue what you think is working but no opiates. I explained I was fine with that and understood, even though I was on them for the past couple of years. He asked if I could call my old doctor if I really needed them. Took my drug test and a week later he call everything in including a small dose and at my next appointment I showed up with all my medications correctly he said thank you for being honest and doing what you said. Every appointment has been great have had some I wait 45 minutes to see him but less than 1/4th. If you are truly needing help and have the correct perception of what pain management is go see him, if you are just looking for pain pills it won't happen.|Dreskin is the worst person I've ever seen! He walks into the exam room no chart, no tablet that holds said chart nothing!! He never asked about my pain.. location, severity, onset, previous surgeries, allergies, previous medications from other Dr's and side effects of those...  NOTHING! First words from his lips were ""I don't prescribe opioids now which of you is Debbie?"" Before he even knew who i was he was already judging me! I proceeded to tell him I wasn't there for opioids I was there for something else... he still didn't change his cocky attitude or ask questions he literally had me breathe deep twice, left the room and never came back!! I hope God has mercy on his soul for judging so many people because when you take an oath to help people that need it you do just that not judge them!!",2025-02-10|2025-01-22|2025-01-20|2024-12-09|2024-05-13|2023-08-08|2021-04-05|2023-04-24,1|5|1|1|5|1|5|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|12 p.m.",52.5|51.5|46.5,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot","How long does it take to wait for an appointment  I called 2 weeks ago and no one has called back","Good luck it's been 6 weeks since I went and still no meds and they say there watering on my end records wow but I called my old doctors they say they done sent them 5 weeks ago so I don't know what's going on",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ0QSbcnhkYIgRzHGHTnzdYtc,67

Doctor H is awesome, I had been dealing with back pain for years with no luck from any doctors. As soon as I had my first visit I knew what was going on and how he was going to fix it. I feel way better than all the years before,  I would recommend this team to anyone dealing with back or leg pain or any pain as they offer so many options for different needs.|Dr hilgenhurst is the best doctor all around iv ever been to. He has empathy and understanding which iv never had with other doctors in this type of practice. Iv been to a few different clinics over the past 13yrs and with each one I felt as if I were some kind of criminal. I felt afraid to even talk about the several conditions I have due to the way I was looked like by those doctors. Even with all the paper work and scans they were more worried about their limitations than they were doing any treatments to help me. Well,,I now have a doctor that listens and gives me hope of getting alot better. Iv been treated with respect and dignity for the first time ever.  Iv only been to a few visits and already getting back to myself. I'd advise anyone that needs help to become a little more normal and live the best they can with there medical conditions to come here.  I give Dr Hilgenhurst a solid 10 in health care treatment. A huge thank you to him and all his staff.!!!|From getting an appointment to my first visit l felt as if everyone actually cared all the staff was kind as well as being professional and l had no doubt Dr. Hilgenhurst knew exactly what he was doing with regards to my care. Thank you so very much.|Very prompt , courteous, informed. Dr Hilgenhurst called in a referral because of the level of pain that I have been dealing with the Doppler, xray, and ultra sound|The Staff are great, answered all My questions and Explained everything in detail on my level. The Physician listened to me and explained in detail, They're working with me on getting my pain management under control. They are Credit to the Medical Field. H.Cothern.|***************************
Very disappointed, I had never been to a pain clinic In my life. I'd waited anxiously to get In with Dr. Hilgenhurst given the fact that he Is the only doctor around that performs these Pudenal Nerve Block procedures, at least that my Insurance would cover. I've suffered from this type of nerve pain for 20 years and seen doctor after doctor for help, I'd traveled 2  hours seeking only a pudenal nerve block for my pudenal nerve entrapment, only to be let down again.

He only offered his opinion, and that Is that a pudenal nerve block would not help me ( I'm desperate here!), although he was quick to recommend a nerve stimulator Implant.
I didn't want his opinion, I'd done my research and sought relief from a disorder that Is categorized as CSD, It's not a laughing matter, it's a painful female (as well as male) nerve disorder, for me It was caused by a traumatic child-birth delivery at the age of 31. I've continued to suffer for 20 years with this life-altering pain In which almost took my life In 2005 due to doctors negligently prescribing anti-depressants (ie., Lexapro & risperdal, Vioxx) In which I did not need, I needed the damn nerve pain to stop. I wasnt depressed, I was In pain that made It hard to have any quality of life due to nerve compression and I'd deserved to be listened to.

I only continue to suffer still, only now It's worse because I've lost total control of my bladder and i have to wear pull-ups now, had doctor's only believed me and not dismissed me, my life would be much different now.

I'm just dumbfounded by the lack of concern shown and the lack of any expertise concerning this mis-diagnosed and biasely named condition women have to suffer with due to the lack of duty & care that Is shown. It's almost too humiliating to talk about.

You sit on this pudenal nerve keeping It aggravated, how will It ever go away?

I could write a book.

**** Update:
After leaving the office upset and after hearing the depth of my story afterwards, thankfully Dr.Hilgenhurst's office reached out and heagreed to doing the procedure.
Hopefully life for me gets better from here.

Mother's you are your own best advocate when It comes to private & embarrassing Issues like this ( ie., nerve pain radiating from the pudenal nerve to the vagina and up through the spine).

Speak up and don't suffer through the pain due to embarrasment like I did.

Kind Regards|No  nobody need to go  down they don't know how likes it so much everyone they nice to me|I've been a patient of Dr. Hilgenhurst for almost 12 years now. He is an excellent physician. He truly gives you the attention needed to help you with your pain issues. He takes the time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options. It's rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient. Me and my husband travel  3 hours one way to see Dr. Hilgenhurst, but it's worth it. I always get the best quality of medical care in all my appointments. Dr. Hilgenhurst, for all these years I want to say thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful concern in regard to my pain issues. The staff were always polite, friendly and helpful.

I always go to the clinic website and read reviews and when I read the reviews I was side eyeing and was nervous as I stated previously. I like to get to know the Doctor for myself. When Dr. McHugh walked in he was pleasant, he walked in with a smile and he spoke me like a human being. We were cracking jokes and everything, things that I didn't understand he took the time out to explain it to me.

Every day I wake up I have pain in every part of my body.

I've always been a very productive, highly effective person. Pain management enables me to work at some capacity, not full time unfortunately, but it enables me to move, think, breath which lessens the anxiety, fear and depression I experience on a daily basis, common for those who've experienced long term, multiple, life threatening medical trauma...acute trauma as well as chronic.

I have a recent B.A. in psychology, studied Health Psychology & Medical Sociology at the 400 level.

Different people respond to pain in various ways depending on multiple factors. Each individual's physiology can greatly differ.

CIPA or congenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis is a condition where somebody cannot feel any pain. They could jump off a building, break both legs, rupture their spleen and not feel a thing. Most of these people don't live past their early twenties at best.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are also people who experience pain more diversely and prolifically, as has been studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

In addition to our endocrine, nervous & parasympathetic nervous and neurological systems as well as other biological factors, some people feel pain way more intensely than the average person. Conditions for example like neuropathy, which can sometimes be cured with simple steroid treatment, but not every pain can be eliminated or mitigated with a nerve block or steroid treatment or other non-narcotic pain medications and treatment including surgery.

Until you walk a mile in a person's shoes, it is beyond presumptuous to assume that anybody who takes pain medication is addicted to pain medication. In fact, to think that way is not only ignorant, it is cruel.

This opioid crisis is happening because not enough people are being prescribed pain medications they need in order to not only function but just to wake up everyday and not cry from the moment they wake up till the moment they go to sleep from pain and how it changes a person's entire life.

When people do not get properly treated for pain, that is when they start seeking medication in non-conventional ways and that's when they unfortunately come across street drugs that have been cut with fentanyl.

This opioid crisis is not happening from the over-prescribing of pain medications. It's much broader and more complex than that.

Many overdoses are happening because patients, or people who are suffering from chronic pain, are self-medicating because they are unable to access pain management either because of their financial situation or because they simply live where there is no access to responsible, compassionate pain management.

It is incredibly difficult to be responsible for even the most educated and safest pain management clinics and their providers because of the opioid crisis.

To be a pain management provider, clinics are a highly criticized area of medicine that in and of itself is part of the opioid crisis.

The less pain management clinics and the less pain management providers we have, the more overdosing and accidental overdoses we're going to see because people are going to be self-medicating if they are unable to obtain professional pain management due to either financial hardship or not being able to access it because of
their location.

To say I am grateful that I have access to a responsible and compassionate pain management provider would be the greatest understatement of my entire life.|I had an appointment at 10:15. They called me back and I had to set in the exam room for an hour. No explanation not even a sorry you've been waiting so long. I'm not happy with the waiting.|I had my 1st visit on 4/15/24 at the Pain Center. Upon being called back from the waiting area the nurse tech found a bedbug on the back my shirt. I'm totally upset and totally disgusted. The tech stated a patient got bite a couple of weeks ago and she thought they sprayed; well apparently not. The sad thing the tech got bit this morning as well.

When I told the doctor Daniel McHugh about the bedbug and me getting bite him and his assistant showed no concern given. Not to mention his bedside manners were blah. They need to have that place fumigated. The nurse tech doesn't work in the waiting room but where the patients are seen so how did she get bite???|My husband doctor didn't even help him at all he kept giving him the run around -1 star there no good doctors office his was Dr McHugh|It is with much disappointment that I write about this clinic that bills itself as a PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC.

I live in my city of Nashville Tennessee and I was born 1959 so I am not a young man but I have been working since 1975 and I was working a full time job but I started to have problems with my balance in January of 2023 and I was falling unexpected out of nowhere I started going to the Mid-town hospital emergency room with pain in my left leg and shoulder, I had CT scan Xrays and everything my primary care doctor finally had me take a MRI and it was then that I was advised that I needed spinel fusion and have a plate installed in my spine so I was really scared to get it done but my primary care doctor was very concerned and he informed me that if I did not get it done if I fell it could possibly lead me being in a wheelchair.

On June 16, 2023 I had the procedure done at the Howell Allen Clinic by Dr. Adam Reig I am a 63 year old man and I am a African American citizen my surgery was over $73,000 that was paid by united health care but it was not right now I have pain in my left shoulder but I have also been diagnosed with arthritis in my shoulders both sides and I have been working with a physical therapist who has been coming to my house after I started having issues with my shoulders and my neck trying to establish my range of motion and I was advised by Dr. Reig that I needed to take time to heal and I should use a cane to make sure I didn't fall in the mean time Dr. Reig said that he could not continue to provide me with pain medication and he would recommend that I get a pain management help to help me with my discovery and the above name Clinic is where I wound up with.
07/26/23 was my 1st time visiting this clinic and I had the Misfortune to meet with Dr. McHugh when he walked in the room he had a young lady who was recording the conversation and it went something like this. He walks into the room and he barely shakes my hand he asked me why I was here he asked me why I was walking with a cane and he was very rude and he said that I was pill shopping after he made the statement he tried to move on but I interrupted him and I said that I didn't appreciate that he didn't know me and he was accusing me of being there for drugs something is very wrong with him and I told him that his oath was too treat pain and if I told him that I was hurting he should believe me I was taking a stronger dose of pain medicine and he has cut it down. I don't believe that he could talk to me like that but I have started to let people know and I called me insurance company to advise them about what I was treat like. I have only been out of surgery for less than 6 weeks and I was given the least amount of medication I have some Xrays that he prescribed for me to do and I am going to follow his advice but if your doctor refers you to the Pain Management group you need to find another one the review on here are very real and I feel that he would not have said that a white person was pill shopping.

I am not able to go back to work and I am depressed to know that I am going to have to file a disability claim after working all of my life he thinks that I want to shop for pain medication I would give everything to get back my health and return to work I know what I feel and I just know that something is wrong with my recovery from my spine surgery.

It has been a really long day to have a doctors tell me that I don't need a cane and I am looking for drugs when I am just wanted to not be in pain.

I am signing my name on this one I think he is a racist guy who looks down on the very people who keeps his lights on inside his building.

Please go somewhere else

I am not through I am going to let the insurance company know how he is and if you have been treated like this as well please let others know

Not there or any other doctors office. But NP Shannon told me I did. How is this possible I don't do any drugs I don't smoke weed I don't even smoke cigarettes. So how could I have a positive result. I notice when they take your urine their cups don't have your name on it or birthday. Maybe my urine specimen got mixed up with someone else because how could I ever have a positive test. I'm so upset and embarrassed by this I cried in the office after hearing that a square like me had anything positive in my system and NP Shannon could care less.|This is for pain management and I love my Dr. They are concerned about giving me the best care possible and I feel they care about me. They always answer my questions if I have any concerns. They accept self pay when most places don't. They are very good about not making me wait very long past my appointment time & that means a lot especially since I drive 1.5 hrs to them every month.|I just started going to PMG in Antioch, Tn and from the beginning of my appointment till the end, Arnold at the front desk was amazing!  Also, I had problems getting my meds one day and Dr. Hill stop what he was doing to contact the pharmacy so I could get my prescription.  It took him at least an hour calling them and getting my script sent else where! I see all kinds of bad reviews but I must say, I don't have anything to say negatively!  Thank you Arnold for starting my day off right with your kindness and thank you Dr. Hill for the care you showed me, most doctors would not do that!|Emily Z Philpott, treated me Very Bad to the point she left me in the room without telling me the appointment was over so when I noticed she wasn't coming back,I heard her SCREAMING in the hall ! Her ATTITUDE was SO BAD,so she then KICKED me out of the PROGRAM for a year...I'm Amazed that someone as RUDE as Emily Would be given that much POWER! Over a Human Life!|I really liked Dr. Hill, at first but after I started seeing Mary Hunyh this year, the visits went down hill from there. She makes it clear, she doesn't care about her patients, or their pain. I been going there 4 years or more and I can't believe things turned out the way they did and I still have lots of back pain. It really hurt my feelings, how they treated me and the excuses they use and not try to help the patient.|I can not say enough about the compassion, kindness and really great care that I've received from Dr. Hill. I was able to get a same day appointment with Dr Hill when I was having excruciating pain. From the moment he stepped into the exam room to begin the assessment, and throughout the visit and procedure, Dr Hill was focused, empathetic, and extremely proficient. I left the visit with significant improvement with my pain, and a treatment plan that I participated in and understood. I am beyond thankful for this clinic and for Dr. Hill!!|My visit today left me very unsettled. The level of care, or lack there of, was so horrendous I wish I didn't drive an hour away for my pitiful visit. The doctor was demeaning towards me when I was open about having bipolar disorder. He stated over and over that I should go see my psychiatrist, though I'd spoken with her before my visit. My primary care doctor left me high and dry once she was needed to fill out a prior authorization so I went to a specialist who would follow through with ordering an MRI. Apparently that's ""doctor shopping"" and is why it's taking so long to find what's wrong with me. I didn't appreciate being talked down to. I was wary of going to a pain clinic in the first place because all of the negative connotations...which turned out to be true. I would give 0 stars but unfortunately that's not an option.|I am always met with friendly, courteous staff at check-in.  My wait time is minimal and nursing staff are professional and  informative.  My doctor is outstanding not only for lthe care he provides but for listening to me and making adjustments that keep my pain under control.

I had back surgery in 2006.  Since that time I have seen doctors in several states but since moving to Tennessee and finding PMG and Dr. Hill, I have had nothing but the best of care.

Nps keep changing and the remaining staff lies to everyone about why.

Dr Bromley and NP Ashley Pennington are both at Southern Pain on Rex Rd in Memphis.  They're taking new patients and their quality of care is exceptional.

They are truly there to help you get back the best quality of life.

They all work together & make it's a place that assures you help is there & available.|Gerri is the worse nurse practitioner ever. Ashley and Angie were the best. Gerri is there to get rid of patients who are really in need of their pain medications. I would not recommend anyone to see her because she is always in people personal business that has nothing to do with her. However, she is the only one at this facility at the moment. Before Ashley and Angie left, no patients wanted to see her. The only thing  the corporate office has to do is pull her record. I  have never had any problems with my pain meds until she became my nurse practitioner. I pay cash out of my pocket to receive treatment, no insurance or anything.

If all the patients here would not continue to go to this facility since she is still here, then the facility would not make money and could not survive without the patients.  The staff here is great, but the  nurse practitioner is awful and I'm only going to continue to see her until my PCP can refer me to a totally different company.

I have never had any problems with anyone at the facility, especially, nurse practitioners other than this one, which leads me no other choice but to leave this facility because that is her goal to get rid of all the black people from this facility because majority of the patients are black.

I'm sure there might be some backlash concerning this post , but I don't care because others always wanted to say what I'm saying now but refused to out of fear. I fear no one but God and if I am dismissed because of my post and telling the truth we'll so be it and watch for another letter coming from my attorney addressing my issues and suing this company for freedom of speech and being truthful.

I'm not going to pay cash out of my pocket and be treated like I'm no one by Gerrie (FNP).  I am highly disappointed and she is noisy in things that are personal and has nothing to do with her at all.  I never post anything about businesses or people, but this is enough and someone needs to know.|I have loved going to Northstar Pain Mgmt. for the last four years but if you need them when your medication is out of stock in your pharmacy they will not help you you will go a week maybe two weeks at a time before they will get in touch with you and change your medication so you're not sick and hurting. In other words if you don't ask anything of them it's a perfect place to go|The staff is nice, it has a very light and friendly atmosphere.  It may be a great place to work, but it's not so great to visit.  My Mother started going here after her doctor died suddenly several years ago.
Since then, there have been 5 separate FPN's, and now, thank goodness, our favorite has returned.
I'm not sure why that's been happening, but am glad our favorite is back.  We have experienced a few MAJOR SNAFU's regarding prescriptions, but MOST of the time there's no issue.
It's a telephonic nightmare to try to reach anyone.  The receptionist rarely answers and some of the department numbers are not even set up to receive messages!   I end up leaving messages for the maintenance department just to get a message through to SOMEbody!!
Just kidding, they don't even HAVE a maintenance department, which is unfortunately obvious, especially in the restrooms.  Broken, wiggly toilet seats are constant.
At times, the wait can go over an hour, the visits with the a ""Doctor"" are 10-15 minutes, tops, so most of the time, we are in and out in 2 hours.  This is TONS better than waiting 5-6 hours at her LAST doctor. So, we know how bad it COULD be, which is why, with all the shortcomings, I still give them a 4 star rating.
Since COVID-19 hit the scene, we've been having appointments via telephone, which go quickly and smoothly and that my Mother loves.
We DID have a glitch in THAT process the other day; they never called for the appointment interview, so I called to see why (they actually  answered the phone THAT time) and the receptionist told me that we were supposed to have COME IN for our appointment.  When I asked her how were we supposed to KNOW  that, since we have BEEN having phone interviews and no one TOLD us we had to come in for our next appointment, she said, ""we have been telling everyone that if we DON'T call you, then you know to come in.""
WHAT IN THE WORLD?!! First of all, you HAVEN'T been tellingly ""everyone"" because you didn't tell US!!  Secondly, that is exactly BACKWARDS!!  Sigh.
So, in conclusion, the clinic needs to tighten up on their procedures, pay more attention to detail and toilet seats.
We love Ashley Pennington, FPN.
Let's hope that will get us through all the rest of the problems they have!!",2024-09-17|2024-07-19|2024-02-20|2023-09-18|2018-04-25|2020-02-13|2023-07-26|2020-07-06,1|1|1|1|5|1|1|4,,,"8 a.m.|9 a.m.|10 a.m.",75.75|71.5|62,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","I am trying to get an appt to come in as a new patient.

The surgery went well and the stimulator is working well!|Dr Homberg has been treating me over many years due to chronic back pain. In April of this year he implanted a pain pump and it has so far finally been the answer we've  have  been searching for. I am now able to enjoy  my life to its fullest!  Dr Homberg is absolutely Great!|Dr. Homberg and his staff have been awesome taking care of my back problems. He has explained the issues and is working to fix me.  I am grateful for their excellent care!|Dr Homberg provided the best care for my daughter. He's very thorough and was so kind to her when she was in a lot of pain. We are so thankful for him!|Dr. Homberg is an exceptional doctor. He cares for his patients and tells them exactly what he's going to do before he does it. He actually TALKS to his patients. I recommend him highly to anyone who has orthopedic problems.|He is absolutely the best! He is very concerned and values you as a person as well as a patient. He will keep trying to treat your chronic and debilliting pain until he finds a solution to your pain. He is just the very best and I would not trust anyone else to treat me surgically for this pain. I am scheduled for peripheal nerve stimulator for my knee. He is so careful and completely thorough as he recommended me for this procedure. I had a trial week for temporary stimulator and I can truthfully say that with the trial I had 95% reduction in pain. I cannot wait for the permanent one to be implanted  and can get back to my active life. He is a very busy doctor and takes about 3 months for an appointment.  It is worth the wait i can truly say. So thankful to be his patient.|I met Dr Homberg close to 8 or 9 years ago after Dr Pucek referred me to him to manage my Complex Regional Pain Syndrome in my right foot and leg. Dr Homberg was friendly, professional and very knowledgeable about my medical condition. It became quickly apparent that Dr Homberg would gain my full confidence and trust. Dr Homberg began treating, not only my pain, but also my underlying fear and concerns. Fast forward to now. Dr Homberg is not only a wonderful doctor, but also one of the greatest human beings I've ever know. He has never given up on me or treating my symptoms or conditions. There have been many times I would get discouraged by the way a treatment was going. He could see the disappointment and discouragement I was experiencing and he would always point me back to hope and he kept my head in the game as well as encouraging me to just keep fighting. He would ALWAYS tell me, ""we are going to get this taken care of!"". There have been times in which my spirit was low and I was becoming depressed. Dr Homberg would and has went out of his way to ensure me that everything was going to turn out fine. Today, I don't just consider Dr Homberg my doctor. He is so much more than just my doctor. He is my friend! If truth be told, I know I'm not the only one of his patients that feels this way about him. I have friends that have needed his services and they've all came back with the same conclusion that I have; Dr Eric Homberg is so very much more than a doctor. He's a man full of character, conviction and skill. Dr Eric Homberg is and will always be my friend! Thanks doc for ALWAYS having my back!|Dr. Homberg Is a great doctor.

If you are late by 8 minutes you have to reschedule your appointment!!

I went off because she would have to go without medication for a month and they moved her to the following Monday.. Today we was 9 minutes late and they wouldn't see her and had to move her appointment again. It is not right they don't give you at least 15 minutes to make your appointment then if you're late then they won't see you. (Every Drs office I know gives you 15 minutes)..... They need to have more care and compassion for their patients especially the elderly because it is not easy for them to get there monthly anyway!!!!.

There is no good communication. The doctors and nurses can't keep their story straight. You will get a different story when you call also. I'm surprised they are still open and haven't been sued. Someone does need to sue them for being non compliant with their patients.|VERY poor patient relations. I mean they go out of their way to be problematic. I'm somewhat leary about care as well. I've been going there for quite awhile now, and not once have they done any imaging, even for procedures.
Lastly, even if you ask for sedation you may or may not get it. Apparently the person doing that has the option of being elsewhere at his or her whim. Which part of an appointment don't they understand? They'll give a couple of pills instead on those occasions which don't really do anything. The last time I went, he was there but wouldn't administer the sedation because it was too short of an interval since I last ate. Not one person had informed me that eating schedules were an issue!
Needless to say I'm researching other options. Probably a place that has more than the current 2.5 stars in reviews. I should have known better, but I started with them on the recommendation of my surgeon. Not this time!|They listen and do everything to help.

I have been coming to this office for over a year, I have my grandson with me half of the time that I go here, I went in today and they let me sit for 20 minutes, do my UA and all, then called me up to the counter to tell me that I can't be seen today because he is with me and it is company policy. He was not yelling or screaming just laughing and the office was dead.This child has been going with me there since he was born. Funny how this has never been a thing and they let me check in and wait and all before saying anything. One of my meds prescribed here is a double med, so it also treats my seizures, pain I can deal with the fish flop not really. Thank you for NOT being an outstanding office.|Would give zero stars if an option. Just got dropped cold from the med program because my ua showed signs of a med given to me while I was in hospital. I reported the med, still did not matter. The female physician is very cold, very unsympathetic. Waste of time and energy going here.|Ive had a total knee replacement surgery and all kinds of shots and procedures done but nothing has helped except medication and because I'm on anxiety medication and its ""dangerous"" they basically told me that I'll have to go to the street to buy the medication I need that helps me even though my surgeon and family has had me on that medication before just fine before this place is a joke and doesn't care about people.|I went to my first appointment and didn't even get to see the actual physician!! The nurse practitioner was going to examine me and recommend my treatment alternatives before even viewing my blood work, MRI and X-rays!! What a racket!! I walked out of there and reported them to the medical board .|Don't waste your time at this place! They put me through the wringer at my first appointment and didn't give me any pain medication because they did not have my records from my last PM doctor. Nothing was ever mentioned about obtaining any records before my appointment. When they took my urine sample, a nurse wss in the restroom watching me. Then she wanted to do blood work and take another urine sample for some other test. She wanted to see me in 3 weeks and scheduled a follow up appointment. I'm not going back. Trust me! Don't go to this place, because they don't care about you! That's why they're so many bad reviews! I really didn't understand why I got an appointment so fast after my referral was submitted. They're a couple of people in the waiting room, and I got back there fast. The only good thing I could say about APS is that your wait time is very short. They must not have many patients.|This is the worst place I have ever been to. Not only do they make you waste your time and have to show up to your appointment AT LEAST 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment time, and if you're not, they won't see you...even if it's still 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment! My husband has SEVERE PTSD and anxiety, as well as memory issues, so he needs me with him at his appointments to answer the medical questions and keep him calm. They refused to let me in the back, stating that their supervisor (who just happens to be on vacation until next week) said that he wouldn't be seen unless he was alone. They violated their own policy that allows me in the back with him for support. Then, when he was upset because I wasn't there to answer the questions, they told him to leave without finishing his appointment. THIS PLACE IS TOXIC. The discrimination and abuse will not go unanswered. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE WITH THEIR PATHETIC EXCUSE OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND RUDE PERSONNEL.|My daughter got insurance through ACA in 2023 and begin care at this wound clinic called Associated Wound Specialists which has no separate wound care apart from the pain clinic. I volunteered to pay her out-of-pocket expenses thinking that this was required for her to receive care.  I did not know that ACA forbids hassling patients much less well-meaning mothers for this payment nor can participating agencies make out of pocket payments mandatory to receive treatment.  The person placed in charge of collection was a receptionist-""bookkeeper"" at the wound care center.   She didn't bother to call me or speak with me directly instead told my daughter I needed to pay $400 a month.  I am a widow who lives on SSA and a small pension and did not have the money so I withdrew the money from my IRA at the considerable consternation of my investment advisor.  I thought I paid them off and, lo and behold, here comes another bill for $300.  I talked to AWS's real bookkeeper, and they told me I was paid in full.   After all this in 2023 and many calls to this agency, my daughter went in 2 weeks ago for a routine appt. and the bookkeeper told her ""tell your mother she owes us $700""!!   No bill followed, no nothing. I asked her for itemized bills and never received them.  I have gotten one itemized bill and asked for another to send to my insurance company and have them check it and have never received a second statement. I am willing to even pick it up and pay the standard printing rate if they would give me another one.  I
In April, my daughter went through a session of painful debridement here and had forgotten to bring her phone to call me for a ride and this same receptionist told her ""no, you can't use this phone because you have germs"". She had to walk 3/4 of a mile in the heat to get to a phone. I went by the next day and asked this receptionist if this happens again, please call me.  She then put orders in my daughter's chart to do that as extending a simple courtesy to a client is beyond her. I think my daughter may need more specialized treatment and we have asked for a referral to a hyperbaric unit or hospital . As you can tell, they have a pain clinic too and the wound care addition is not listed separately by google. It's sad to me to see patient health compromised due to poor management of billing practices and a receptionist that does not practice courtesy and professionalism. Last week the practitioners decided billing, rather than medicine,  was in their purview and  the medical part of the visit included a  front desk person going back to the treatment area and loudly bemoaning the treatment she received while they all castigated my daughter during debridement.  Real class act folks!  They apparently have forgotten my request for an itemized statement as they sent me a request for payment by phone this week and , guess what, no itemized statement.  Am reporting them to the TN Medical Board.",2024-11-21|2024-10-10|2024-10-31|2025-02-03|2024-08-10|2024-05-08|2024-07-10|2024-05-07,5|1|1|1|1|1|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|2 p.m.",73.75|72.25|68,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking","How do they do their in house back treatment","Horrible place ..",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJB-aAacU8XIgRigVXpojOo1o,180

They treat everyone the same as if every person is a drug addict. It's unbelievable that they can look at themselves in the mirror in the morning and feel good about themselves. I do understand that there are people out there that have a drug addiction and use the pain management system to get more drugs but there are a lot of people who are in a lot of pain on a daily basis that need their pain managed. I've been going here for almost 8 months and I had just been in a car accident, fresh out of surgery for my second right shoulder reconstruction. I also had many surgeries in just the past 4 years that changed my life. I was in the best Physical shape of my life up until then, so I had been trying to cope with the struggles mentally of unable to do a lot of physical activities like I was used to doing. The chronic pain really has an impact on a persons mentality. I had broken my neck, had Cervical titanium cage at 3 levels. I had a major discectomy of my lumbar spine & was in the hospital for 9 days first but it didn't help me. So, I had to have a 360 degree titanium fusion with all levels of my lumbar spine, removed 2 discs and replaced with prosthetic disc's approximately 19 screws, post and cadaver bone. I also had a full left knee replacement, right shoulder surgery then in December 2023 I was in a auto accident while I was on my way to the doctors with my arm in the sling. The impact destroyed my right shoulder in the sling, left shoulder as well. The force of the airbag threw my right fist into my mouth knocking out teeth and the seatbelt caused internal bleeding and fractured 6 screws in my lumbar.
Amanda was supposed to be my pain manager and instead of coming up with different solutions to help eliminate at least some of my pain she acted as if I was taking up too much of her time and simply wanted to come up with a way to lower my meds, not lower my pain or even know what the cause of my pain was. She would always say that they have to stay at the set threshold of medications.  She never looked at any of my MRI, X-rays, CT scans or medical history whatsoever.  When I asked her if she had gone over any of it she got extremely defensive and lost her temper with me. I was very calm but bothered by this and told her that it wasn't ok the way she was treating me, as if I was an addict. I have extreme nerve damage, arthritis throughout my whole body, hands burning, left leg getting atrophy and loss of function. I couldn't sleep at night due to the level of pain and had been taken to the hospital at 2:00 am. The ER doctor had looked over my medical history and asked me who the pain management doctor was and that this was unacceptable and would constitute Malpractice and patient abandonment.
She never answered me, simply said ""I'm done!"" And left me sitting in the exam room. I called and asked for a self discharge letter on 11-8-24 and was told they would fax it to the new pain management doctor and put it in the mail to me that day. I have Not received it yet and they never faxed it to the new pain management doctor. I'm not one to cause drama or want to take anything to the level but the way they have treated me and reading o lot of these other reviews is disgusting and should not happen to anyone already trying to deal with the life changing issues that new pains cause and then have to deal with PA or Doctors who don't care or put you in the same basket assuming everyone is an addict! Do NOT go to this place if you truly need pain management care.|My Insurance had this place on list so My doctor Referral me here for severe chronic pain along with pain from cancer. And instead of being treated like a human the staff was 2faced i waited months to get in be seem the dr said quickly without letting me answer his questions that just no we don't do pain medication for people like you a speach about drug laws what pain meds are and then how he recommends cold turkey a cold shower and that I go home and deal with it? It being overall pain from chronic spinal pain & this new cancer pain and quickly to be rude with me and so my blood pressure is 196/114 and feel like this guy just is enjoying himself with the smile he has on I feel horrible already so I politely said no thank you this isn't place for me dr replies fast good glade you understand. I got upset but didn't show it but my mouth slipped thank you for time & thanks for wasting my time.. Dr turned around and tried to punch me in face I'm in a wheelchair so I pulled my head head back and thinking I shouldn't have should have let the punch connect because today I'm In severe pain I don't don't feel well from what happened yesterday stress & pain is overwhelmingly and the pain meds I have right now I havto stretch them beyond what quantity & dosage so I'm in pain anxiety overwhelmingly I'll and I can't do anything. I'm not able to get better im not responding to treatment because I'm in overwhelmingly pain & stress and this dr shouldn't be working such apathetic uncaring and I'm scared I'm overwhelmed and all Dr's tennessee are apathetic to care.|I was a patient up until last week.  I had been seeing them because of a neck fusion I had.  I then had a rotator cuff surgery. My Dr did not increase my meds after my surgery.  So I had over taken them.  I told my surgeon and he wanted a letter from the pain group saying I was fired for over taking my meds.  Well, I had misunderstood him and I just signed myself out with the ASSURANCE  that I could come back a anytime
That is where it all fell apart!!  I was out of medication and had been to physical therapy so I was really hurting.  I went to the clinic to see if I could let them know I had over taken my meds so I could get the exact letter my surgeon wanted.  I initially did not want to get ""fired"" from the clinic.  So, I never told them that.  I went up to the front desk where the site lady sits and takes your name and checks you in and I nicely told her I needed to speak with someone about an issue I had.  Gave her my name and birthday, she told me to have a seat and I did.  After a minute she called me back up and told me I was no longer a patient so  can't come back for a year because I signed myself out. I tried to explain I was assured I could come back. She kept arguing no I could not and telling me for that reason I could not speak to anyone.  I saw the lady who assured me I could come back and I pointed her out.  She came up to the window as the glass was shut and their heads were turned only to have the receptionist open the window and tell me I FAILED my drug test so I needed to go.  I was a little upset by this point.  Remember, all I came in for was a new letter.  I wanted to see that failed drug test that never was shown but the actual Dr came out and got me.  I thought great, now I will get somewhere.  Not a chance!  He basically said he did not care if his employees lied to me.  Also, I got a new letter alright, it was checked that I was released for threatening behavior towards staff and so on!
If you go there, one ing I know is they will lie to you about anything, even if you fail your drug test or not!  BEWARE|My Dr. I see is Amanda Larson. She's so sweet and always works with me to find a solution to whatever problem I'm having and I have alot of medical problems so for her to put up with me and everything I have going on is awesome!

ordered a shot for my pain! Had me set up with an appointment for my procedure, explained how it worked. I was happy with my visit!|Very busy but appears to be efficiently run and in order. Staff was great and so friendly. Kept asking me if I needed a blanket or anything else. Doc was cool. Easy to talk to you and very informative of my spinal epidural procedure. Still within the first 24 hours of recovery, but so far, so very good. I am feeling much less to almost no pain right now at 535 am cst. Thank you so deeply to Dr. Allen and the staff.|Dr Allen performed 2 nerve blocks on me and an ablation. I was told that he would call me in 2 weeks to check in. I never got a phone call this or any other time I was told he would call. When I asked if I should make a follow-up appointment, I was told no. He would call. Well I am still in horrible pain and the procedure did not work. All he cares about is the money. I'm still getting bills after months. I've paid about $8000 and they had the nerve to send me a bill for over $200 for a video chat that lasted less than 2 minutes and I had to wait for him for 45 minutes. I am very unhappy with all of this and would definitely go somewhere else if I had it to do over again. I am out of all that money and still in pain every day. They would know this if they had actually cared about their patients.",2024-09-17|2024-08-01|2023-10-18|2024-07-11|2023-06-21|2024-06-14|2023-10-18|2024-01-14,5|5|5|5|5|5|4|1,,,,,"Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJrcGkB9BvZIgRaXf_fqSM6x8,270

Wait times are very short. The office staff is courteous and professional. They helped me with my chronic pain, and ultimately, to reduce my medications. They have helped me with alternatives that will soon enable me discontinue all of my pain medications.

This is in stark contrast to another pain consultancy that was profoundly unprofessional. The details of which are in another review.

Thanks to the doctor and staff for helping me during a very difficult episode in my life.|I didn't start going until May but, my husband started in January. We had a good doctor the first couple of visits then was turned over to a NP who didn't take time to talk to us. Now we've got a new Dr. and really like him, he is very concerned about our pain problems. Our new NP Hannah Brown is a great doctor, she takes time to talk to you and is concerned about your problems. She is very sweet and friendly.|I have been coming here about five months now and it has been a great experience. The staff is kind and efficient. The wait times are minimal if any.

Doctors and NPs are very helpful with pain management. I have had no problems with changing appointments due to conflicts or sickness. Great office.|You all are amazing. I've always been treated with kindness and respect even when I'm having a really hard time with my pain. You treat me like a human being not like a drug addict. .|Hello, I started going to this clinic for pain in 2022. Everything was going well until they changed doctors. I got a call from Courney Travis. The worst of the worst was that they discharged me for asking for documents to make an appeal on my insurance because Here they only offer you RFA for everything.  I told them to do it until my insurance covers it.  They are charging me almost $900.00 dollars and for trying to investigate that bill they discharged me saying that the medication count is inconsistent that I told them bad words that I did not take my medications there several times.  My pain pills were always too much, they were always too much.  At the pharmacy I didn't pick up my medications until it was time to pick them up.  They accuse me of several things because they want to cover up how irresponsible they are towards their patients. It makes me sad that many elderly people go there.  There they give bad treatment.  I told them that in August 2023 I had surgery to lose weight and from there they accused me of being a drug addict.  They did major surgery on me and they accuse me of that... I RECOMMEND YOU FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO GET HELP FOR YOUR PAIN.  HERE THEY TREAT US VERY BADLY.  THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THAT THEY DO RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION WHICH IS A VERY EXPENSIVE TREATMENT AND THEY DO NOT GIVE THE INSURANCE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS.

When you call the emergency number, you will be told that they do not consider prescriptions as an emergency even if it's their mistake.

And All the other clinics just wanted to
know my insurance info and to make sure I could pay.
I immediately canceled all other appointments and went to Precision pain.  Every single staff member has been so nice and helpful. Dr. Hilgenhurst was extremely thorough and helpful.  He new all about my case before he even sat down with me and even new some things about my injury that were not in my file, just from his prior experience.  Overall this has been one of the most professional and effective doctor experiences I've ever had. I am so lucky and thankful for finding Dr. Hilgenhurst and his staff. 10 out of 10|I've been in pain management for many years, and I have been to 3 different clinics since I moved to Murfreesboro.
This is honestly the first one that I've ever found that treats me like a person and not like ""just another drug seeker"" which is why I left the other pain clinics.
I'm a retired RN and First Responder and I've destroyed my back lifting patients for over 30 years so I live in constant severe pain.
Dr. Hilgenhurst is a very kind, caring and professional physician who treats me like a person, and that's rare in pain management.
His staff are absolutely wonderful! From the front desk to the practitioners and especially the lab technician, Jim.
With the help of all these people, my pain is finally managed to allow me to be comfortable for the first time in decades!
The wait time for appointments is rarely very long; on average 15 minutes or less. The waiting room is large and has plenty of comfortable seating.
I am truly blessed and grateful to have finally found such a wonderful place to go for my pain management!|I had been a patient with Dr. Hilgenhurst for the past 8 months till this morning.  I had been very patient every time I went in for an appointment because it always took at least an Hour and a Half to even see him.  This morning was no different, my appointment was at 9:00 AM, he finally walks in at 10:40 only to tell me I am being kicked out of their pain management program because I got an injection from my Ortho Doctor at TOA instead of using his office for the injection.  I had tried to schedule the injection with Dr. Hilgenhurst's office but due to time restrictions of having surgery in 6 weeks and not being able to get an injection 1 month prior to surgery I scheduled the injection with TOA because they could get me in.  If you plan on using Dr. Hilgenhurst's office be prepared for a VERY long wait at each appointment and be prepared for a very rude doctor.  I can not believe that they would kick out a patient for getting medical treatment they could not provide and then be a rude as he was, literally walking in, telling me I am kicked out and then walking out leaving the room door open and walking off and leaving me to find the check out area myself.  Talk about childish and unprofessional.|I'm so grateful to Dr. Hilgenhurst, he Is the first Dr to help me with my pudenal neuralgia pain, which I suffered from for over 20 years.
The pudenal nerve burn took care It, And solved my pain as well as horrible bladder Incontinence that comes along with pudenal neuralgia. So I thank you!|I have had No Problems While Going to Precision Pain Care.. As a Matter of fact.. They are very Professional.. The Doctor and All the staff is the best!! When I go in and tell the Doctor My Problem.. We Make a Plan.. He also give you Information about What will go on with the Procedure.. I Now understand more about my Spine and how it effects .. Different parts of my body.. I had a problem.. They Got Me back into the Office within 2 days.. I can say only good things about Precision Pain Care.. Also yes.. They Do have rules.. I know for a fact if you do things correctly you will not have any problems.|Horrible and incredibly long wait times and unprofessional staff. I was an hour earlier for my appointment since I had to go to work the same day. I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes just to be called to the back. Prior to being called back, I notified the front desk receptionist that my appointment had gone way past the time I was scheduled and would like to be seen as soon as possible due to work that day. She rudely stated that even if you arrive at the appointment time early or right on time, they cannot promise I will be seen by the scheduled appointment time. Then after finally being called to the back, I was forced to wait an additional 25 minutes in the patient room. After no-one came back to the room, I left without seeing the doctor. I honestly couldn't believe that they run their clinic/establishment so poorly. Patients are already in a lot of chronic pain and are not capable of sitting or standing for long durations of time; therefore why would they purposely make patients wait for extremely long times? To top it off, while I was waiting in the patient room for 25 minutes,  I could hear all of the nurses and the doctor conversing over what they are going to eat and social media. It's really sad that their main focus and priorities are not on the patients. They can do way better than this. Unfortunately, I'll never go back to find out if they have improved.|I've never been taken care of with all of my conditions, as I have with this practice. Each time I go and see the doctors and or associates they make me feel welcome. They listen to me and help me with all my issues. They take time with me and never do they act like they are in a rush. If you need help with all your pain and what goes along with it, Precision Pain Care is the one you need to go to. Check it out, I did and I'm very satisfied 100%.....|I was impressed that the doctor treated the ""whole patient.""

When I got there the front desk was rude I ask for a pen to fill out paperwork she said to your right. Then I found out that the paperwork was 10 pages long. So they call me in the office for my consultation with Dr Timothy and was told to pee in a cup. I that it was just to set and talk about your options for the next appointment. But no they made me pee in a cup that was not comfortable doing so I ask The nurse Mary if I can do it on my next appointment and she did you read the paperwork it was in there.She rude to me and she next time read the paperwork. This my last time going there very poor service.|The nurse Mary was rude and so was the staff as well.And I also want online to fill out my paperwork and it keeps longing me out . Got to the clinic to find out the website was old and out dated So the front desk gave some paperwork to fill out and it was 10 pages long. Then I had to go to restroom and one would show me were they were. And parking is bad as well there was one friendly nurse in the office. This was my first time going there and my last.|This is for the Clarksville clinic. I was very hesitant after reading previous reviews to go here. However, I found my experience was very good. The reception lady was nice and my nurse Renae was great! Dr. Miller was very nice and listened to any and all of my concerns. He is a very supportive doctor who really wants to help you! I will be returning here for future visits!
Update:
Had my second visit today everyone was very pleasant again from reception to my nurses Renae and Medora. Once again Dr. Miller was great at explaining what I was having done and talked about what to expect at my next appointment.|Front desk people were rude. No internet access for guests. Can't use a wheelchair unless you give your ID for them to hold. Long wait times.|I appreciate the care of the medical staff.  Dr. Miller and Dusty seem to genuinely care about the 'quality of life' you are pursuing and want to help you achieve your goals .
They are providing excellent care during this time of transition while I am trying to figure out what my new normal is in realizing realistic results for my condition.|Update: The CEO, Brooke Peck promised to schedule me with a different provider and then I didn't hear from her again. She admitted the information on their website is not accurate. I did not receive quality or compassionate care and am in fact being delayed in receiving treatment due to the failures of this provider.

Disregard the list of treatments on their website, as I was told they do ""pills and injections"" and they ""don't know anything about holistic stuff"" even though holistic care is mentioned twice on the front page of their website. They continued to prescribe medications that did not work but would not do any other type of treatment for pain. And they will not deal with pain from multiple origins. And I was encouraged to disregard the advice of my cardiologist and use a topical that could cause me to have a life threatening arrhythmia. This is not pain management unless you're just looking for opiates which you will get at the first appointment whether they actually work or not. Other helpful treatments they offered did include the suggestion to use a heating pad. That's not worth the copay.|The front desk receptionist act like they do not want to work. Walking in for my second appointment nobody in the lobby, has me wait as she did the first time. Asked her last month and this month about my referral she says it is not in. I call my doctor that sent referral and states the sent in back in September. So I give them another call she states again no referral. When I tell her I contacted my doctor and they assured me they sent out the referral she then does her job and finds it. She then tells me I should receive a call to set up my appointment. I received the call unfortunately I do work so missed it. When I call back same receptionist answers and tells me I am to wait for a call to be scheduled, I told her I was called she then requests the name of who called I told her I wasn't sure they left a voicemail to call back. All of that should be in the notes which I know they were seeing as she then found where to transfer me. I gave two stars because my Dr. Is amazing but he really needs to not rely on the receptionist to give him accurate information  about referrals seeing as they can not be bothered to actually do their job. They need to hire new ones ASAP|During our initial consult which consists of only ordering tests and talking, I requested a lesser scheduled muscle relaxer to control the extreme pain until our next appointment to go over xrays and potential treatment, he said absolutely not because he isnt comfortable with that, i respected his answer and we quickly ended the apppintment. Cut to our next appt, after seeing ""just a mild curveture"" in spine that is likely caused by muscle spasms and a neck that is a tad too straight (military neck) rather than ordering the next appropriate tests to narrow down CAUSE OF PAIN and possible treatment plan Timothy Miller told me that Im really not going through anything bad enough for any type of ongoing treatment that he prescribes. He was so disregarding- he made a disgusting statement that i was in there begging for medications and that i was lying about a horrific reaction that i listed as an allergy to ZOHYDRO. WHICH BTW IS NOT HYDROCODONE- if you look up the structure and details about that specific medicine and youll find it is identical to a subutex. I trialed it in October and broke out into hives and Anaphylaxic shock.

After being treated like a dog and crying in response to that treatment he was willing to write me a script for 10mg Oxycontin ER twice per day.
What is so interesting is that the XRAY report showed misalignment from muscle spasms. Why wouldnt you go with a muscle relaxer that literally acts similar to an opioid? But isnt as strong as one. I discharged voluntarily soon after that last appointment.
As of June 2024 i am diagnosed with Multilevel degenerative disc disease and Spondylosis. If Dr Miller would have taken the appropriate steps to better treat a person in definite severe pain with plenty of PT, imaging. and physician reports recorded that he didnt even glance at. I wouldnt be in Debilitating pain right now. I would have had a better treatment plan for the previous two months.
This city is packed full of doctors and NPs that medically neglect and abuse patients. Timothy Miller does not need to practice in medicine involving a persons physical or mental health. I think he would fit better in Radiology reading where patients dont see you.

I finally found a God sent Doctor in Hendersonville. I DISCUSSED THE SAME CONCERNING ISSUES WITH DR. COZART AND RECEIVED PROPER TREATMENT THE SAME DAY ALONG WITH REFERRALS AND 24/7 ACCESS TO DISCUSSIONS RELATING TO MY HEALTH CARE.

Dr. Pepper treated me with empathy, concern and care. He prescribed me a medication routine that includes a compound cream. With the regimen from Dr. Pepper in conjunction with my holistic and natural treatment; I am now able to not only independently do activities of daily living, I can also travel and engage in social activities. Thank you Dr. Pepper and your passionate caring staff for improving my quality of life.|I was a patient of 25yr of another pain center, they retired. So I went to Alliance not knowing what to expect, the staff is super friendly, Dr.Pepper is the nicest professional Dr. Of course I did have my meds lowered because they couldn't get my records and being a new patient. ( I expected this, because of gov. rules) but they do everything they can to help you, you do have to have proof of test. But I've been there almost a year, and look forward to being a patient for many years.|Dr. Pepper and his staff have always been friendly,  professional and never rush me through my visit. Dr. Pepper always takes time to listen to my concerns and gives several options to alleviate my pain. I highly recommend Dr. Pepper and staff.|I totally agree with the people who who have had a terrible experience and who were judged by Dr.Pepper and was talked to like a dog!! How dare him . he questioned my integrity and why did my previous doctor prescribe me a certain type of medicine and was I short on a pill count, really that never happened!! How dare him!!and was told he will get records. Needless to say I will be going to a much better place where they will treat you with upmost respect not like Dr.Pepper does!!|Dr.Pepper is awesome!! He definitely cares about his patients! All of the staff was nice!!|Dr. Pepper and his staff are Amazing!!! Everyone is so kind and caring. Dr. Pepper is so smart and figured out my issue immediately! After treatment from him, I am no longer in pain! I am so thankful God placed him in my life!
I highly recommend this company! I was hesitant about going to a pain facility,  but I can assure you, they are there to help you recover and live a pain free life!|Dr. Pepper made life incredibly more difficult for my husband during the time he was a patient at Alliance Pain Management. Dr. Pepper is not a good listener & has predetermined his course of action regardless of the patient's needs. When they parted ways after eight months, the doctor ""graciously"" prescribed TWO WEEKS worth of medication to wean my husband off the medicine.

I had an appointment with them on 6 December and they cancelled and didn't even give a call or anything!! And I cannot even reach anyone there. Voicemails are always full. Very unprofessional of them, especially with this being my first appointment. Glad I didn't make the drive at 7a.m., because my appointment was at 8!! Absolutely unprofessional. I finally called to see when my appt was since my provider had it moved up due to their not calling to tell me my first was cancelled and giving me a another appt a month and half later, they tell me this appt is cancelled too, because they claim ""I was rude on the phone."" Lol. That's exactly why my machine records all my calls, so that's how I know they're lying. And the staff can be heard totally ignoring all I spoke about. It's good that I won't be going there because actual former patients have told me that the staff is rude, they treat patients like drug addicts, and they'll automatically cancel/discharge you for any/every. I refuse to go to a place where I have to bow down and not be treated with respect. I have a clean record with my meds, clean drug tests and all. Makes people wonder about the staff and what they're doing. I'm thankful to NOT HAVE TO GO!!!!!!!|I have been here 4 times every time they make a reason NOT to write a prescription. Every time
I went to Egypt and was given tramadol for pain spectrum said I failed my drug test bc they have no record of the prescription. The first visit they said they didn't have my records and it's illegal to write a prescription. The other visit said they don't have enough records for me .they have my records from memphis,x rays everything. They are not the only pain clinic in Jackson that accepts insurance and I'm not going to let them have any more of my money and tell me they can't help me. Teresa doesn't even know what she's doing and the patient is the one that does everything. She said I have acute pain which is false its been 9 months that is not acute pain. She finds a reason every time not to help me. Meanwhile my general practitioner has bent over backwards to help me and spectrum is able to do and they refuse. Go somewhere else. I wish I read these reviews before I ever went in the first place this is my last time. Teresa ignores anything you say and pushes you along like she's not getting paid to see you. She doesn't deserve the money she gets. They push shots onto people. I'm serious do not give these people your money. You mean after months you don't have enough records to decide anything???? You are  trash  believe these reviews. Also you won't be able to get another appointment for another month ,so it's month to month you won't be helped. One day will come it will be her turn to be in pain and I hope  she goes through as many hoops as she puts her patient through. I wish she would loose her license then she woukd know how it feels to be at the mercy of someone who could help but won't.|I wish I could rate them negative. I had 2 bad experiences with them. I tried again within a 5 year lapse hoping the 2nd time, they would have better management. They sent me to Memphis for a nerve block on my leg instead of my back which I suffer from flatback syndrome. She saidn  if I tried the injection and it didn't work, she'd give me low dosage of pain medication. I tried the injection and she did NOT give me any pain medicine. She called in a pain cream at a pharmacy in Mississippi when my insurance coverage is State of Tennessee.   So that was the first time, and I gave up and started self-medicating.

The 2nd time the nasty FNP told me I had to stop self-medicating and drinking which helped my pain for 30 days before they would even talk about what was the next step. If I could go 30 days with nothing, I wouldn't have been at a pain clinic.

The signs that say DO NOT RECORD are illegal because they know they are doing something wrong.  This clinic should be turned in and investigated.  I moved on and am satisfied with the care I am now receiving.  If I weren't in constant pain 24/7, I would not be at a pain clinic.   Baffles the mind why they won't treat each individual  patient to his or her  own needs. (Opinion from some of the reviews sounds similar)|I went to Spectrum for a pain management procedure on my neck. This would have been done elsewhere but my doctor moved to Memphis. I was not there for pills. The NP arranged the procedure that an MD would perform. The MD never saw my face or spoke my name. He came into the procedure room after I was anesthetized and face down on the table and left after he gave me the injections.
The procedure room is separated from the waiting area by a door and while waiting on my procedure I listened to two patients having theirs performed. The nurses and MD were yelling the name of the patient telling them to be still. It was embarrassing. Then once the procedure is complete the patient is rolled out to sit in the waiting area for recovery. No privacy. No dignity preserved.
The office is noisy with the workers talking loudly and cutting up with one another. I could literally hear way too much information about other patients. Doors were open that shouldn't be open. Honestly, the whole experience was like something from a bad movie. Very unprofessional. Go elsewhere!|My S.O. has been treated by Spectrum Pain Clinic since 2021. We've been through several providers, most recently Teresa Kee. Her lack of common sense and lack of knowledge about the disease process of one who is in end stage Renal disease and on dialysis is a joke. She referred my S.O. to psych because the disease process of his kidney failure causes lethargy, extreme generalized pain, fatigue, and periods of time where he sleeps a lot throughout the day. An appointment has yet to be established. Ms. Kee determined he's at risk for opiate use.... Well umm you prescribe them. Most recently, they cancelled his pain contract stating his drug test came back positive for a medication he is no longer taking, and it's been two years. When told this, we went to his patient portal, and they had blocked him from viewing it, therefore we cannot see the results of his lab. Ms. Kee further stated that He is being noncompliant with the psych referral, when we are still waiting for an appointment. Lastly, as a nurse, I know that opiate pain medication cannot be stopped abruptly, and the pain clinic is refusing to prescribe more or ween him off the medication he is on. This can cause further damage to his heart and kidneys, and they do not care. There is no compassion for the medically vulnerable, or those with a terminal diagnosis.|BEWARE!! I have been there to see Harmon twice and now and it was a horrible experience!! He minimized my pain, doesn't listen, lies, rude, uncaring. I suffer from chronic pain with many ailments. Osteoarthritis in all joints, I have a bad spine, and a muscle disease, etc. Harmon does NOT listen to the patient!!! Why in the world is he allowed to work with people who are hurting when he is the most uncompassionate person I have met in this field. I have NEVER had any problems with any of my nurses or doctors.  He purposely will argue with you even when he is wrong. I left both visits and cried all the way home. He made me feel like I wasn't even a human being. I have also heard from others he treated them the same way. I now see what others who left reviews, as to what they went through.  I wish I could give zero stars!!! Does the owner of this establishment not read people's reviews?|Wish I could give Zero! Ronald Harmon is awful...he used to be a prison nurse if that gives you a rough idea of his bedside manor. My first apt, after years of well controlled meds, he cut mine in half and said ""see you next month"". Two months later it was ZERO! Refused to write a Rx for any. Awful care, should have his license stripped! I'm 62 and have never been treated so badly. He will question your diagnosis and call you a liar. Go back to the prison Mr Harmon!|I am so impressed with Crystal Hill, who is the NP in charge of my pain.   She is so knowledgeable, as well as caring.

Always friendly Always professional Always on time as much pain as I have been in I needed a physician who listened and got it right the first time.|The most amazing staff that takes the time and effort to actually find out what's wrong. They have truly changed my life for the better. And they care deeply for their patients. I am most grateful to have found Dr. Isaac and Alexandra.|Yesterday was my 1st time going there.  I was very impressed the staff up front was super nice. After I filled out my paper work it didn't take me to be called into a room. Wasn't even 5 mins Dr Isaac and his pa come in the room Kristi Duffield they were very respectful to me. They didn't look at me as a druggie I would recommend to go see them. I'm hoping they will be the ones to fix my back.I got a couple things to do like xray and mri. My 1st visit was amazing. I have been to different painclinic, by far this was the best one
They talk to and listen to you, I was very impressed. Anyone that wants a great pain clinic go see Dr Isaac. Just talking to him for a few mins i though anyone that could help my back its him. I've been to 8 different surgeons and all they say is they were impressed I was walking. That's the only help I got And these drs were in Nashville. But I felt so comfortable at Dr Isaac office. They made you feel like we can help you. And his PA she is amazing. She sat down and we talked everything out. She is the best. I have searched and searched for a great Dr. Im so glad and thrilled to be going to Dr Isaac's. I really do think they can fix my back. What I'm trying to say you want a great Dr and a great PA go to Dr Isaac's office. You won't regret it.|Kristie Duffield is absolutely the best and caring professional. Nothing but wonderful people in both offices.|Dr. Issac is an absolutely amazing Dr ! I had a cervical spinal fusion done about 2 years prior to seeing him. I had no quality of life and couldn't rotate my head much at all! We agreed upon a small noninvasive procedure that he explained very well to me. 2 of those procedures down. I have movement of my head and my movements have came back. Monica is the representation of what a nurse is supposed to be. I have also been to his Antioch location as well they are absolutely amazing also not to mention that location has a beautiful office amazing artwork! All together if I could give this medical team a 10 I would.|You know, I've been looking at the reviews and I feel that the bad reviews are unjust for various reasons.

I was recommended by a POOR Neurologist and am VERY grateful, as this clinic was a Godsend!

Dr. Isaac and his staff, both front desk AND medical team are EXCEPTIONAL! They actually go above AND beyond to address what issues you have WITHOUT shoving different and tons medications down your throat, even when all other treatment plans have failed! They listen to your concerns and offer suggestions on how to address the pain outside of medications and the wait time in between appointments, unlike the Neurologist I see.

Oh! Don't let me forget! That review about racism, I think you need to look within yourself on who's being racist because they show no signs as that clinic is VERY diverse in ethnicity! Maybe control your attitude and respect the hard work that these individuals offer just to treat you! Respect is EARNED not given! You must give respect in order to receive respect!

As long as people are honest with doctors, you will get the treatment you deserve both as a human and medically.

Thank you team AND Dr.  Isaac for what you do!  You are amazing souls! Much respect and VERY thankful you are a part of my health and spine journey!|Dr. Isaac and his staff are so nice and the office runs very smoothly. Saw a couple of other pain physicians in the distant past and quit going altogether because of the way I was treated and how unorganized they were.Dr. Isaac and his staff have really helped keep me moving!|Give respect to get respect and I have never gotten anything other than respect from the front counter people,the nurses, and the doctors.Dr. Kristy Duffield is doing a great job for me.

I definitely recommend seeing her if you are looking for genuine help!!|The Doctor is pleasant and the treatment received was good but the customer service and    getting access to my own records and notes from my treatment there has been horrible. After attempting to receive my own notes from my treatment there received over two months ago, I was informed my notes would be available in a few weeks, the notes were never sent to the VA upon completing my treatment there. I then went through the Va to have him request them on my behalf and for days they sent fax requests with no answers. The Va finally called the clinic and asked them about the requests for my progress notes and they told them it would take weeks (2-3) to be sent to the Va. I have been done treatment at the clinic for two months now. Would not recommend unless you absolutely have no other choice.

The staff and Dr Bethi are pleasant funny and you feel right at home.|I'm giving this place two stars only because Dr. Bethi DOES prescribe Suboxone to her addict patients that need it. However, after she prescribes you the medication to stay off of the harsher opiates, communication becomes key between you and your Clinic as written in your patient policy you must sign that you agree to... which becomes impossible because the only people you get to talk to, other than your short 15 minute appointment window with the Dr., are the staff and believe me, they are not listening... I had a tough weekend and tried to call in to leave the Dr. a message and they never passed any of my messages along.  I asked Dr. Bethi on what became my final appointment with her, if she had received my messages and she said no and she was obviously surprised to hear that I had left one... Her staff doesn't care about the addiction treatment side of this Clinic and business which is absolutely unfair, unpleasant and unwelcome to any of the addicts enrolled in the program.  Honestly, the only way this program is right for you is if you are a part of the few (less than 1%) addicts that never have a slip up or the opportunity for one during treatment.  All it takes to fail at treatment is for your family and friends to have a lapse in support for you because of their own concerns.  Addicts aren't always going to make the right decision when they an opportunity comes time to make one, that's part of the point of Suboxone, to make it where they don't need to make a choice because they don't feel they need to.   Anyways props to Dr. Bethi for prescribing it but if she prescribes you less than 1 strip per day per month... get out.  It's proven that less than that per day per moth has a high likelihood of program failure so don't waste your money... and save yourself the heartache and embarrassment!|I have past experience in usingThe place they want me to go for an MRII want to go to Paris Hospital imaging as I always did them There in the past.

Called my dad a liar so there's no way he looked at his extensive long term medical history. Called all his other doctors stupid and that he's the only one that's right or knows anything, even though he himself was in the wrong. Like the other reviews state he is dehumanizing and only listens to his own voice. I'm shocked he's even employed there.|Dr. Welker is a very kind, compassionate and informative doctor. He listens and tries to help! His staff is friendly and makes you not dread coming to your appointments! Great clinic I would highly recommend!|This clinic took me on as a patient when few would. I was a patient of Dr.Murphy's and at the time he was considered persona non grata. Long story short,they've been nothing but nice and supportive to me since taking me on. I saw Welker for a year and now I see Jack Garrett who's equally nice. They're strict,as they should be,so if that's a problem then this might not be the best place for you. With a little discipline on your part,they can help you the way they've helped me. I appreciate them both|Welker had an attitude, when he came in..didn't listen to anything, except his own voice..a know it all, that has no compassion, or human kindness in him. I have not had any problems in the past, with taking meds or anything, that would make him prejudge me..he is on his own power trip, and I would never go back to him, under any circumstance..we came to a parting of the ways that day, and if you look at the reviews for that clinic, you will find that I'm not alone In feeling this way.|Great MD if you want a caring and top notch care.

First of all, it surprised me that I only had to wait a few short weeks for an appointment.  Secondly, registering was easy, although I struggled to answer some of the written questions about pain.  Thirdly, Dr. Welker's exam and diagnosis makes perfect sense to me and made me realize my main issue was VERY worth coming here.

I Was in a bad car accident about 5 years ago. Have nerve pain down my arm and neck  still today. I went in and saw a male doctor and he immediately didn't even give me a chance to talk and all he said ""oh 5 years? You should be better now"" but I am not. Continue to say that I am fine didn't want to look at my X-rays , MRI and doctor notes. The fact he never look at it and didn't care AT ALL ABOUT MY HEALTH! Raises big concern... horrible place I will have to fly back to Philly and actually get real treatment and the doctors or much educated too. DO NOT GO HERE !|This office has been my saving grace. I've been dealing with pain since the 80's. They are fun to interact with and sensitive to my condition. After four years of trusting them with my pain issues I would never go anywhere else. They are diligent in finding ways to give their patients a better quality of life despite the pain. I really appreciate how, as a patient, I have input in my pain management. Being with this provider I can say without a doubt, they've shown me how to live my best life. I say thank you!|Always friendly and courteous,  from the receptionist to Dr. Le himself,  I have been to several pain management practices and I have never had one I would give a 5 star review until I came here. I had an epidural in the office at a previous practice and left in tears. Dr Le addressed my anxiety about this, because I told him I would never do it in office again, I wanted to be sedated. He promised he would not hurt me, so I said I would try it if he would stop if I said it was painful.  He said he would, and he was right, there was very minimal pain and I have done it in his office ever since. I highly recommend Dr Le to everyone!|This place was literally the biggest waste of my time and money. Was a patient for almost a year before getting the hint that this place was not going to change. Each appointment I would typically have to wait at least 2 hours to see a doctor (most I've ever waited was 3 hours and I told the receptionist I was going home because there were STILL people waiting in front of me). Then when Dr. Song Le or Dr. Mitchell saw me it was pathetic. They spent a max of 10 mins with me, told me to stretch, and then left. THIS WAS EVERY SINGLE TIME. Their attitudes were equivalent to ""I have 3 more patients left for the day and I am on auto pilot"". There was zero plan of action, and all they would offer were ""muscle relaxers"" that are essentially the same as baby aspirins. I gained absolutely nothing from coming here and my back pain remained. The Mount Juliet location was so much better (on time, attentive drs, etc) but it still seems if your issue doesn't require surgery, they don't have a way to treat you. Please look somewhere else for pain management. I had to find a physical therapist, chiropractor, and massage therapist in order to feel any sense of relief. And all 3 of these other practices treated me like a human who valued my time and what I had to say. This place will not help you but rather cash in on insurance. The worst doctor's office I've ever been to.|The staff and physicians at SJNMR are so kind and thoughtful every time I call or visit. They have worked with me to control my pain and worked to get me in quickly when I needed to come in before a scheduled appointment.  They really care about their patients and do everything possible to help and show compassion.  They each one have my deepest thanks.|Dr Son Le performed a RF ablation on my husband's lumbar arthropathy that causes him intense, debilitating pain.  The ablation helped his pain and mobility dramatically.  Dr Le identified exactly where and how to perform the ablation with expert care and precision.  We are beyond grateful for Dr Le, his expertise, and exceptional care.|I visit this office on a regular basis and have also had the highest standard of care. The girls on the front desk are great and polite and the doctors are really superb.  I see Lori and she has been nothing short incredible. Great place, great people, great care. 100% recommended.|This is an absolute sham of a doctor. The absolute WORST!! I was a patient for about 3 years until they ""upgraded their system."" ""Upgrade""  means they cancel their appointments and do not make an attempt to notify you. Twice I took off work to drive across town (45 minutes) for my regular appointment only to realize I magically wasn't on the schedule AFTER I had already confirmed it. The first time I should've dump them but the second was the last and final. I immediately found a new doctor.
In addition to their complete unprofessionalism with appointments, many members of their staff are RUDE. The doctors are ALWAYS LATE and I've sat there waiting for nearly 3 hours on multiple occasions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BECAUSE THEY WILL CERTAINLY WASTE YOURS!!

Front desk staff still needs work. I feel like they hate their job. Never a smile, never a hello, good morning/afternoon, how are you, etc. I have just come to expect that when I get there.

2020 Review Below
Dr. Reddy and his nurses are amazing. However, it is almost impossible to get anyone on the phone. I tried for 3 hours today and was just left on hold every time for over 30 mins. This is an everyday problem,  not just today. Been trying for weeks to get through. In addition, most, not all, of the front desk staff are rude and will ignore you while you are standing at their desk to check in. One day I stood their for 6 mins and they completely ignored me until I asked if I could check in.  Then I got an attitude. My pharmacy has been trying to reach them for over a week to fill my prescription and they do not respond. I haven't had my nerve medication in over a week now. They need to fire most of the staff and get ppl in there that actually want to do their job. Not even sure how they're even open. There is never anyone there no matter what day or time I go.

Please train your customer service people in how to service a customer without catching a tone|I wouldn't advise you see Chrissy Moore. Her office staff will chat with patients in front of you,stalling you from checking in in time. When that office staff asks if you could still be seen (conveniently leaving out their long convo making you later, too late) Chrissy will turn  you away for being too late. Perhaps if they didn't have just one person working the desk that apparently doesn't care about whether or not you make your appointment, this would have been completely avoided. My mother is a person and patient first. She is not a billing claim or a paycheck. She deserves to see providers that will value and actually care about her, not about how quickly they can eat their delivery. This is why we will leave this practice and now go closer to home. Two providers there are losing a very good patient. Perhaps Chrissy and the practice as a whole can use this as a learning experience and improve their procedures for their other patients.|It's hard reading all these reviews that talk Dr. Reddi wasn't compassionate or the front staff was awful and no one could get through on the phone. That hasn't been my experience at all. I've been able to reach someone on the phone each time I've called. When I came back to see Dr. Reddi after a 2 year break because my chronic pain became unbearable again, he remembered exactly who I was and what I was suffering from. He's always taken the time to listen to me and I felt very validated and heard when I left his office. If you are suffering, please give them a chance because they are a great group of people.|Not happy with the level of care, or how the system is set up... not being able to dial up a particular office or even reach the last person you spoke with is maddening! The support staff is severely lacking manners, office etiquette, as well as a sense of urgency when the waiting room queue is steadily backing up. The Doctors these folks are representing would be well advised to clean house and try again! Some of the PA's could seriously use some work on listening, empathy for your fellow man, and bedside manners as well!! Believe the reviews, keep shopping!|They've done an excellent job of reducing arthritis pain in my lower back. They've done a couple of procedures,cans I was quite satisfied with the experience.

First of all I am going to start with the fact that I am not a drug seeker frankly I avoid taking prescription pain medication unless it is to the point I have to so I am not an addict but do have chronic pain that I deal with daily and interferes with my quality of life.  I seen Dr Ward after waiting 2 months to get an appointment and an hour in waiting room he spends a total of 3 minutes in the room with me. He ask me nothing about my pain and never examines me at all.  He did say he wasn't going to give me pain medication ok that's fine I was more interested in injection or something for relief.  I was offered nothing no muscle relaxer injection nothing I am left to suffer. I have never been treated like this before.  I hope this doctor never gets treated like I did today. And Thank you Doctor Ward my kids Thank You as Well|My husband who is not a drug seeker saw Dr Jain and he had never been rescheduled for a return visit even though he prescribed him medicine. Called last night to be told that the dr had recommeded a spinal stimulator however that had never been discussed with him and that he would have to see a psychologist to have this done. Today they called and the Dr has decided not to see my husband anymore because they are unwilling to prescribing anything more nor was my husband willing to do the shots which was a lie so what I was told last night must have been a lie. This is the worst place on earth and the nurses are rude and disrespectful! Why did this ignorant doctor prescribe something if he had no intention of following up.|This was the worst place I could have gone for treatment. They treated me as if my pain really wasn't as severe as I was telling them. They made me feel like a junky every visit. The nurse practitioner they stuck me with was atrocious. Her name was Rebecca. She made me feel unworthy of being there at all, even though I had back surgery while being a patient. I have multiple herniations of discs in my neck and lower discs that ruptured as well as nerve damage that can't be fixed. My last visit I was one pill short on my pill count and she kicked me out. She said it doesn't matter if it's one or a hundred your short. I explained that I may have over looked one in my daily dose pack at home and She said that was a personal problem. She made it clear to me that she doesn't like poor folks so if you aren't affluent I wouldn't even consider going here.|When Dr.Pearson was there, she cared about your pain level and your well being. After she left the place has done a complete turn around. They care nothing about how bad your pain is and all they want to do is injections, which would be fine if they worked for me. Every visit they cut my meds down and tell me I could have a injections. I am in so much pain I am unable to do anything, my blood pressure is running out of control, I have diabetes and was keeping it under control by walking now I have been put on diabetic meds. When I told Painter about it she did not care and told me to lose weight and then cut my meds down more. Dr. Pearson told me that painter was uncaring and that she would never put me with her, after Dr.Pearson left I was stuck with her. If you are truly in pain stay away from these Doctors.|I absolutely loved Dr Pearson. I been with them for a few months and have reactive arthritis , degenerative disks, three bones that need fused. Recently had a flare, a bout with Flu, and a stomach bug. I have had 1 injection but missed 2 due to having infection. Called and cancelled 1 and the other in office. Even was prescribed more than normal on last visit, had pharmacy call with deacrepance and give me the regular amount. Well I get called for a medication count and drug screen same day as a drug screen for DOT card. Some how they say I had no medication in my system there but at my DOT I did. Explain this?

I am now dropped, won't even finish with my injections or nerve ablation. Kick out the pill seekers faking the issue and let us who want to work be treated. I've had various drug screens for employment and all have read lortab over the past few weeks. My pain keeps me from working. I can barely even pee to get y'all a good sample because of my urinary inflammation. I have taken a driving position so hopefully, but doubtful, I won't need medication.  I even asked if decreasing it so I could take this job was a option and asked for a letter to be sent to my DOT appointment that would allow me to pass. If not back to disability and you doctors can pay my bills. I would have came right back in if you would ask. I'm tired of jumping through hoops wearing ankle boots, taking 12 medications, and having to rub compounds on me everyday just so I can work.  Shame on you. Get rid of Rebecca or you are going to lose patients. Everyone else there is great.

And furthermore both test were done at Ballad facilities but you can't except the one done just a couple hours later at Occupational Medicine?

Ever since 2018 when I was in a ATV accident and flipped off the four-wheeler and landed on my neck and shoulders at first I thought I had a broken neck thankfully no broken bones but I still was banged up pretty good and since then tho I have had pain in my neck and shoulders and back.  And I recently tore both rotator cuffs the left one much worse than the right,  I was told I really needed surgery.  I have had 11 surgeries for multiple health reasons so I didn't want a 12th surgery. Instead I came to grace point to find ways to successfully treat and manage my pain so that I can have somewhat of a normal life and do the things people without chronic pain enjoy.

My son is quadriplegic and in chronic pain every day. His prescription was due to be filled on 2/15. After dealing with reminder calls since last week (their request), repeated unanswered calls, voicemails, line holding, hangups, and even the text line that they have, I drove 45 minutes to the office to witness signs on the door stating that they aren't opening back up until the 25th and that they will be closed every Monday. There was absolutely no notice. Now, we are stuck trying to connect with the insurance company and other agencies to try to get my son the help he needs. My son has been a patient for years and the last two years have given rise to high attrition from doctors and staff, piss poor standard of care, constant forgetting to send in prescriptions, witnessing patients come in as directed but staff input wrong information and then the patient be rescheduled, and etc. When you finally reach someone on the phone, it more often than not someone from another country who basically conveys that they will have the messages forwarded to the office and then you wait and wait some more. Please, find someplace else to go. Save yourselves this constant stress, aggravation and pain if possible. It was not like this in the beginning. Now, it's atrocious. He's been assigned to 5-6 different doctors/NPs since he's been here...four have left.|Please don't let this reviews fool you. I started here two years ago following my doctor from another facility. Hugh mistake!!! You can never get anyone on the phone besides foreigners that's stationed somewhere is stationed outside the office. The doctor does not have proper bedside manners and don not care if your meds are on time or not. Expect to be at the least a week behind on refills so if you can manage your pain without your meds then this the place to go. If you don't care how your doctor treats you then this the place to go. If you want the proper treatment for your pain management then don't go here.|Shawne Martin , FNP.  I love this doctor she cares about her patients, She takes time to ask questions and she takes equal amount time to answer questions. She is  very insightful, compassionate and helpful. She understands pain management and how it affects your body.  She has great bed side manners, you are a patient and not a number.

My only complaint is systematic issues when needing prescription filled in timely manner, I have waited for up to 7 days before my prescription was called in, medical withdrawal is pain and it does a number on your body.

You MUST be mindful of your therapeutic level, It may have decrease and that causes you to sleep a lot until your body regulates itself back to your prescribed dosage.

The young ladies at the front desk is kind and always has been professional, when I was having an issue with getting my prescription, she called management to the front.|I've been coming to this office for nearly 7 years? I've gone through several Dr's and turn overs. I stay here only because it's the closest to me and I do like the staff there.  It has happened more than once and this week I've been calling and leaving messages on every extension,I spoke to someone 2 times, and was assured my medicine would be called in,I stayed on hold 3 separate times 1 for a hour and 36 minutes while on a 2nd phone for 56 minutes only to get disconnected on one and had to leave a message on the other. 3 days now and I'm out of my medicines that were due to be picked up 3 days ago!!  There's ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for this to have happened.  I truly hope leaving this review will get someone to contact me and help in some way fix the issues this office has.  I'm going to do more research to find a way to contact corporate offices to report and get this worked out.  Until then I would ABSOLUTELY advise any & everyone to find another office.  If anything changes or comes from this I will repost to help others.  Lastly I am NOT the only person whom has gone through this so beware.|I saw Shawna Martin, N.P. and she was amazing! She took her time with me and really listened. In the past, I have felt like other doctors have rushed me in and out and didn't really stop to listen to what I was saying. Shawna addressed all of my concerns and did her best to help me find a treatment plan that worked for me. I really hope she stays at this location!|They kicked me a 100% disabled vet out for not wearing a mask in 2021 when I was fully vaccinated, no symptoms, and they wouldnt furnish a mask or covering as they did previous appointments.

Asha, is so kind and considerate.  The nurses couldn't be sweeter. The receptionists are all very sweet and patient.  Everyone that I have had contact with have just been great.  The office is clean and spacious for walkers or wheel chairs.  There is a water machine.  There is also a large screen TV.|I have been a patient here for almost 8 years. There has been an issue or two, years ago. They were resolved. Doctor Le really cares about his patients. He took the time with me, I'm terrified of needles, to earn my trust and ease my nerves so that I was able to allow myself to have very helpful treatments. I had had a horrible experience immediately before coming here. That's why it will be terrifying to go elsewhere. Unfortunately I can't afford self pay anymore and the only insurance that I can afford is not accepted. I will truly miss this place and pray I can find another doctor that I feel I can trust.|I have been a patient at this office for appx 9 years. I have an illness which has required multiple types of treatment, including medicinal, physical therapy, in office procedures, & a yearly behavioral therapy check up. Before settling on Dr. Le's office for permanent care of my illness, I had tried 2 other offices. I chose this office for my permanent care, because #1, it is truly a full care facility. Any treatment I need specific to my illness can be done within this office. This includes doctor visits, small procedures, physical therapy, behavior therapy, and multiple testing procedures. There is also a pharmacy across the hall if you should need it. I feel this is very vital to the high level and continuity of my care, having all treatments through this one office means, to me, that the doctors and practioners have full access and knowledge to every part of my illness and it's treatment. They are aware if something does or doesn't work for me, and I never have to repeat a treatment that isn't beneficial to my care, which I appreciate. The second reason I chose this office is due to the wonderful people who work there. In 9 years, I have never had any negative experiences with anyone. Everyone from reception, to nurses, to doctors and to check out, is very kind, pleasant, and accommodating to any special needs you might have. Dr. Le is spectacular at his profession, he has performed back procedures on me that truly improved my quality of life, which involved almost no additional pain and very little recovery. He is amazing. Dr. Bryant is my primary care physician within this office, and she is also amazing at her job. She has patiently answered every question I've ever had, and taken into consideration my own feelings towards aspects of my treatment. She has performed treatments that were extremely beneficial to helping me increase activity levels, while also helping decrease my pain in those areas. I have really appreciated being under Dr. Bryant's care. I have referred this office to other people who needed this type of care, and they too, have had really successful experiences. I would definitely refer Dr. Le's practice to anyone in need of his services. I go to the office in Summit Medical Center, but there are other offices that might be better located to your home. I feel this practice is very focused on good patient care and is fully equipped to give every patient as comprehensive care as possible.|Great place! I'm always in and out and never have to wait over 30 minutes. My doctor always is attentive to my needs and the whole staff is very professional! I would reccomend the Center for Spine Joint and Neuromuscular Rehabilitation at Summit Medical to everyone who has chronic pain. They rock!|I am not comfortable with new people or places like most people I'm assuming but Dr. Lee made me ease. I would strongly recommend him and the facility|In my opinion Center for Spine and Neurological  made me feel welcome and comfortable. The staff is very professional and friendly. I considered it a blessing to be treated with such experience and confidence by Dr. Lee's staff.|Absolutely love the care and detail they give here.  Truly works with you to find solutions and different ways to treat you. Very professional but also very friendly. They take great care of you.|I was referred to SJNMR for treatment of my neck & back injuries after a car accident.

Absolutely awful. I have Parkinson's. He treated me as if I were not a person. Called to make appointment to come in to see a doctor. I had a spinal stimulator put in. My doctor left. I wasn't seen after my operation by any doctor.only George Miers, the Nurse. He yelled at me on the phone. I was on speaker. Everyone in car heard him. He told me I couldn't come back to that office, my doctor want there any more. Because of  Nurse George, I am never going back. I may be handic but I'm still a person George! I wouldn't give you a 1 out of 5 stars. You ruined that office for me!!! Also, he was flirting with the women who worked in the office!!!|Very professional. Extremely knowledgeable, they are a legitimate pain management clinic. They offer a lot of different types of pain management And procedures to Target your pain with many different types of combo type therapies and treatment. I deal with chronic pain they have been able to help me considerably. They really put in focus and effort on targeting your pain.|HORRIBLE OFFICE! They charged me an office visit when I did not receive any visit/procedure. I called to speak to the office manager and billing department and nobody helped look into it. On my patient portal it shows notes that were falsified and notes from my first visit pasted again, with information that never occurred.

On another visit I signed a form to put my procedure through with insurance because they said it wont be covered. They sent me a bill of the cash price. I reached out to insurance and they explained nothing was ever filed with them and insurance reached out and it was completely covered. They then started billing more things on this procedure to gain extra costs.

I would ABSOLUTELY STAY AWAY from them, only cause more pain and frustration.

UPDATE! After months of speaking to them, they said they will look into it. Well they just instead ignore it and don't get back to you.|THIS IS A LONG READ BUT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW!!
Initially I thought I had found the best Dr ever when I saw Dr Vanterpool, but as it turned out it was the worst experience of my life going to the pain clinic there! She was able to diagnose my CRPS right away and started a treatment plan but it didn't work and there was no kind of backup plan in between my appointments which would be weeks apart and I was in a lot of pain. Anytime I would call, I I seldom got an answer but the voicemail says your call will be returned the same day if it's before 3 pm, but I never received a call at all most of the time! If I did, it was from the receptionist at the front desk. She would put me through to someone in the back and I would get their voicemail and they would not return my call! When I had appointments I rarely saw Dr Vanterpool but rather someone who I thought was a PA of hers, but was told he was only a Nurse Practitioner. Dr. Vanterpool has taken on too many patients to see them all very often and she takes off a LOT of days from work! She micro manages the office and doesn't allow anyone who works under her to do ANYTHING! She is the only person that can order a prescription or make a decision for a patient about anything....even her pharmacist cannot call in a refill for you! This is no way to successfully run an office of any kind. It is doomed to fail! They had 3 people to quit in a short time and the ones left were throwing their hands up trying to keep things going. I wonder why THEY all left??? She put me on a pain patch that was addictive. It never helped my pain and I kept calling the office telling them it was only giving me terrible side effects such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweats and Insomnia. FINALLY after a few weeks something was called in to help those symptoms! My last visit to see her was to help me taper off the patch. I go in and there is her Nurse Practitioner...not her of course
Then he decides, he'd better ask the boss, so he gets Dr. Vanterpool and when she comes in, rather than telling me how to start getting off this pain patch, she tells me that I
don't seem to be getting helped by her and she dismissed me from her care! She didn't give me anything to help me get off the addictive pain patch and I had to do it alone! What kind of Dr does this? Not a very good one. So all you people be very careful of what you let her do! I had withdrawal symptoms having to come off that pain patch and it was a miserable experience! She could have prevented that and that's what she was supposed to have done since she put me on it. That was a cruel thing to do!|Dr Vanterpool & her staff are great!  Physician Assistant, Jennifer Mitchell & her Medical Assistant, Amanda, have been very caring, attentive & persistent in making every effort possible in getting my husband all the help & assistance needed since his spinal cord stimulator placement.  I feel assured their goal is for him to be as pain free as possible!!|I've been going to UCPM for close to a year now. I've found them to be extremely professional from the front desk, to the exam rooms, to talking to any of the NPs working there, or any of the doctors who perform procedures there at the office or in Day Surgery.  Every single employee that I have ever met in my office appointments and Day Surgery have been knowledgeable, polite, courteous, kind, and encouraging, plus, and this is a big plus - they have a sense of humor.  Everything has been spelled out to me, my questions answered and they treat me as a person, asking me questions, what they can do to help me, and they pay attention.  I recommend this office to any and all that tell me they have pain.|Horrible Office, This is the second time my husband had a appointment with them and we have the appointment card showing the date and time, the office staff saying my husband does not have appointment till following week. We have a long drive to get to this office and such a waste of time for us going there.  The front desk does not know what they are doing and can not established the appointments correctly for the patients. My advice to you all is either go to another clinic with a better professional staff or call before going to be sure you are supposed to be there.|I had a spinal injection for lower back pain that gave me no relief.  When I went back for my follow up appointment my doctor was Jennifer Q. Mitchell, PA-C.  She was very knowledgeable and sympathetic that the first shot had not worked. She suggested where she thought it might need to be placed from the location of the symptoms I gave her.  She explained it very simply and professionally.  The second shot gave me 85 to 90% relief in about a week.  All the people at UCPM that I saw were good but she located the problem area that helped.

On my follow up visit for my second spinal injection Jennifer was glad to hear that it had worked. The stinging in the back of my legs was gone but I still had pain in my groin area on the right side. Jennifer, on further examination, ascertained that it was not my back causing that, it was my hip. She arranged for me to have an x-ray and a shot in the groin area of my hip which relieved 95% of my pain.

On my follow up visit for the injection in my hip I saw Audrey Wohl,MSN,FNP-BC. Jennifer had taken maternity leave to have her baby.  Audrey has taken up my care in Jennifer's absence. Audrey was very knowledgeable and gave us some very good advice concerning my continued care.  She suggested I do physical therapy on my hip and set me up with the UT physical therapist in Sevierville.",2024-12-30|2025-02-18|2023-10-26|2024-02-12|2023-09-15|2024-03-19|2024-02-06|2023-11-07,1|5|1|1|5|5|1|5,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",59.4|56.8|56.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do they except humana","Yes, they do.",emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJxWuv_Ew9XIgR_ZtdDNUbYI4,36

Staff has always been nice to me.  The Dr added something new to my meds.  And wow!! What a difference it made.  After 10 years it's nice to wake up and to be in little to no pain. I can finally enjoy life. And miss Wendy is amazing.  She has a big heart.  She can always tell when something is bothering me and she will talk to me about it.|I feel heard and understood during my visits. The care is excellent and the staff is supportive. I was having a very rough time in my life and they were patient with me and what I needed. Would recommend!|Just wanted to share my experience that I had today.  Dr Bunker and Dr Wendy have always been very professional and caring with my issues. I have been a patient of Dr bunker for several years and he has always taking time to make sure that I have the care that is required for diagnosis. Dr bunker and Dr Wendy have always went above and beyond to provide excellent care for myself and other  members of my family. I always have had a good experience with all of the employees.I would and will continued to recommend Dr bunker and Dr Wendy And there colleagues to anyone that would value their services.|Dr Bunker and Wendy are very friendly and listens to you. The staff is great and I would recommend them to anyone|Worst pain center I have ever gone to. So unorganized! My last appointment was 9 days ago and today in 11/16/23. Still did not get a refill sent in. They pass the buck at to excuses. Mean while I have been out of meds for two days. Driven over 2x now to facility with still no results except them blaming Kroger. Funny, I never have had as issue with Kroger before. The doc is ok but hard to understand when he speaks. He kind of talks looking down. I guess they now have a NP helping but she can't call in meds so that didn't help. Just an unorganized place that each passes the buck to someone else. Finding new place to go. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IF LAST PLACE ON EARTH!!|Waiting 3 months to get to see Dr Bunker Finally got into see him very Satisfied with him.He told me he could tell I was in pain. That he would call me something for pain.That was a week ago. After repeated calls at least 7 to 10 calls a Day 90 % of the time answer machine came on said office was closed please leave a message and they will call me back. Never did return any of my calls. Got my Granddaughter who's in the medical field who's in Cookeville TN. I asked her to go by Dr Bunker office to see if they would call me. The manager got very hostile with her. Told her to leave And she followed her out to her car The whole time trying to keep arguing with her. Then I got a hold of the DR Bunker office. My drug test was clean and told me that they were not going to see me. If you're in any kind of pain. Please find another clinic Perimeter Pain clinic. Is not a good place does not return calls let you know what is going on. The whole thing could have been avoided if the staff professionals.  Staff is the worst I have ever seen, Simply doesn't care. I'm going to see if I have any recourse going to medical Board.|I'm sorry you have stayed that it was the pharmacy that made the mistake, but I've had the same pharmacy for 20 years and they writhe the order as it is sent to them. And I am not the only patient that has had this problem. But congratulations to your new staff and I pray this change will be a positive one, especially for the patients needing quality care from professionals...
Good luck with your new staff and God Bless you all|Dr. Bunker is great. Understands my pain issues and does all that he can for me. I'm sure that if the state would relax some of their rules that he could do more. But I also see the other side of people complaining of pain, people that sell their meds. It's shameful in the way they act towards their pain issues.
So with a failing liver and 20 years of pain I'm thankful for any relief that they can offer me.

When I lost my mother and brother both in the same year she and the rest of the staff especially Joy, Sabrina, and the office manager Barbara offered so much kindness and support that you just don't find at most other places. Joy toes the drug screens and pill counts and has always had great advice and support for me as I have endured many healt battles and struggles. Sabrina is so friendly at the front dest and she is always smiling. There is another nurse who is in the room who is putting the information in the computer and she is always willing to listen or offer advice. Barbara is the office manager and she is always on top of anything that needs handled in the office. She's very professional but is supportive and friendly as well. All together, this pain center is one I would and do refer my family,  friends,  and anyone else who needs their chronic pain managed.

My reasons for leaving were purely financial. I was at a point to where it was pay rent or go to the doctor, regardless of the pain. I find myself now looking for a clinic and comparing reviews. I am shocked that there is even one bad reviews of TNPC. I was treated with nothing but kindness, professionalism, and respect from day one. Alot of the staff became like extended family members. I had shared alot of experiences with them in 5 yrs. Births of grandchildren, most recently the death of my father. My appointment just happened to be within a week of his passing. The empathy and compassion I was shown are unmatched. I appreciate everything they did for me. They made life much easier to live, as I am on my feet 12 plus hrs a day. And now am completely miserable. I would reccomend them to anyone. They have an amazing staff. You won't be disappointed.|I had the worst experience ever. I have never been afraid in a doctor's office before, so today was a first. First, what I was told on the phone and what I was told when I arrived was different. Second, while waiting to be called back they refused to allow me to use the bathroom even though I repeatedly asked. I finally had to drive to a gas station to use it. After I returned, I decided I did not wish to go to a doctor's office that refuses people common rights. I then requested that my appointment be cancelled and that I wanted a refund. I was told Angela would have to issue the refund and to wait. A few minutes went by when the office manager and another lady, neither ladies identified themselves (names), called my name across the waiting room. When I went to speak to her she wanted to take me in the back, to discuss the refund, which I was willing to do if my daughter accompanied me. She not only flat out refused to allow anyone to come back with me but physically placed herself between me and my daughter while raising her voice, which frightened me that she should behave in such a way. She then told my daughter that unless she had medical power of attorney she was not allowed in the back while we were discussing the refund. At that point I left. I never received a refund, they rendered no services, and I had to go straight to the bank to try to cancel the transaction. It took my bank calling them in order for me to finally find out the office manager's name, Barbara.|They don't take insurance at all but want you to pay for their ""Family Concierge"" program for between $65 to $170 per month and has copay charges.

After 26 yrs of suffering from a fall that led to 349 falls ,244 subsequent procedures , surgeries, and 140 concussions, my doctors chose
to send me to the greatest Orthopedic Surgeon on the planet,  Dr. John Cornelius. He was the 34th surgeon I interviewed for my devastating hip/pelvis injury. By the time Dr. Peace sent me to Dr. Cornelius I had worn the ball of my leg bone completely away - my leg was bouncing around on the many bone spurs that had developed in my pelvis. I was prescribed 3 -60 mg Oxycontin and 4-20 mg oxycodone just to get out of bed. Dr Peace and I started reducing my meds just prior to my surgery and we continued to reduce them after my successful hip replacement.  After the best physical therapist lead my physical rehab I began walking for the first time in 26 yrs without constant pain- after falling 349+ times after my pelvis was cracked 4"" I had no pain in my leg/hip. Dr. Peace and John successfully took me down to 30mg Oxycontin and 40mg oxycodone. My pain clinic gave me back my life. I want everyone to know what a GREAT pain clinic this is. I will always owe my life to them and I love them to the depths of my soul!!! Thank you all for everything!!!|All staff are very caring and do everything they can to help manage my pain|Worst pain clinic ever. They are just like drug pushers. They deal in volume and loosing 6 or 8 people every couple of months is nothing to their overall Extreme Income.  They advertise well!

I'm a 51 year old retired veteran, with over 30 years of service to my country. I have had 34 surgeries from my time in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. I've been seen, here, for the past 4 years.

What did I do wrong:  I couldn't pay them anymore money. Tricare pays minimum. So, they invented ways to get rid of me.  It worked.  They lied stating my surgeon didn't report my medication after my surgeries, so it's my fault, even though there were vebal and written records that state otherwise. They called in for a pill count, for the first time since I started with them over 4 years ago, after they KNEW I was on vacation in another country. Europe isn't a 6 hour drive. The one that really gets me is ""Failed to bring in bottle"" after they do a urinalysis.|They do not listen. At least to me. I have more than one spine and pain issue. I have no understanding of why, with all my issues, that they are NOT considering the intense constant pain issue I live with everyday. It's like they are playing God and supposedly know what's best for me which is so wrong. How dare they judge my pain? I wake up in the early morning hours contemplating going to the emergency room! Not only on my first visit cut down the mg I was already on four times a day. They also cut the lower dose to three times a day. I saw Dr. Stone for the first time in January.  He raised the mg but still cut down four to three times a day. I met with the nurse practitioner on 02/05. I told her how I wake up everyday between 2:00am-4:00am in pain because I am missing that fourth dose. Did she listen to my pain? NO! She turns around and cuts my dosage back to the lower one four times a day!!! What? I am extremely disappointed with this office because obviously they make judgments rather than listening to a patients needs. I'm so frustrated and continue to be in incredible pain! Drs are supposed to do what's best for their patients.  Not what THEY think is best. Why are they even pain management drs if they ignore a patients true pain. It is just so wrong. Sadly I have no choice but to go there so I am at their mercy. It sucks.
If you have a choice to go elsewhere,  GO please...|The staff are very outgoing and really nice. The doctors here are also very nice and really care about your well being.

He was in Vietnam, lost an eye, spent 6 months in a hospital, has so many medical problems and said out of all the doctors he has seen in his life he has never been treated more inhumane than here. A Dr. Stone, after he was hit by an 18 wheeler on the interstate examined his neck by pushing down as hard as he could and twisting it. This left my father James in extreme pain and he screamed stop and he just walked out saying nothing. My dad is forgetful and would keep some meds beside his bed and if he forgot to add to his count he would say I'm sorry, I can run and grab them, to which they would reply you could by them off the street for all we know. I told dad to come here bc I was enrolled to go to school to be a Nurse practitioner with a dear friend a d she worked at a different pain clinic. I apologize for sending my fatherchete to him all the time because I am his advocate.|Great doctors and NP's.

From the very first appointment with her, I felt judged and uncomfortable. Instead of offering support or compassion, her demeanor made me feel ashamed for even seeking care. Living with excruciating pain is hard enough without being made to feel like there's something wrong with me for needing help.

Her bedside manner is poor, and she comes across as though she's judging every patient who walks through the door. It's clear she lacks the empathy and understanding that patients deserve. While she is a nurse practitioner, she receives the same fees as a doctor, yet she doesn't come close to delivering the same level of care.

I dreaded every visit with her and ultimately decided it would be less stressful to switch to a different practice altogether. If you are assigned to Dana Simpson, I strongly recommend looking for another provider who will treat you with the respect and compassion you deserve. This was one of the most disheartening healthcare experiences I've ever had.|They absolutely suck if you are under 45 do not go there!!!! I needed pain medication and procedures. done I held out as long as I could. I kept saying we're working on it for the procedure. After 6 months I gave up and found another place. Other place did the procedure in less than a month.  Without that procedure I was excruciating pain, and the pain pills they were giving me, did not cut it one bit. A pleaded in begged for the 6 months I was there if they weren't going to give me the procedure please up the pain meditation. And they said nope cuz I'm under 45. And the only reason I'm giving them a 1 rating it's because they gave me the pain pills that was less than I've been taken for 10 years... There's better places out there don't mess with them|I think any type of pain management is an absolute joke! Every time u go through that type of thing they make u pee in a cup take blood, ask a gazillion questions! It's a massive invasion of privacy! It's bad enough that when u see an actual PCP u go through basically the same thing! My husband was asked to do pain management just to see what they would say! He was diagnosed with narrowing of the spine it's very debilitating he also has some other heath issues going on!  doctor came in to see him ! She basically said because of his mental problems were that bad! That his PCP was poorly managing his mental health! That the pain isn't that bad! That she wanted him to do water therapy! That she would have some patch sent to the house ! The whole appointment was a complete joke!               When a person is diagnosed with severe spinal cervical issues or anything like or other severe health issues that cause severe pain! Of any sort! We as human beings have to go through so much just to get a little help! Which is not right! NOT everyone should be put in a category ! It's a disgrace that we have to go through all these hoooops just to get help and for someone to LISTEN !|Dr. Kaplan is very neglectful. She goes on multiple vacations and has her staff reschedule appointments with the promise that your medication will be sent to the pharmacy. When your medication is not sent to the pharmacy and you call the office multiple times to get your prescriptions sent to the pharmacy while doing without for DAYS at a time. She does not care that you have withdrawals. She does not care about the time it takes to call her office month after month because she fails to send in your medication to get you through until your next appointment. Don't ever let them reschedule your appointment until your medication is at the pharmacy. You have been warned.|Waited a month for this appointment. They sent me multiple text reminders with the address in the message. I arrived an hour before my appointment as requested. Turns out the Doctor i was meant to see was working at their other office. Unprofessional and disappointing.|I've been coming to this Office for some time, It all starts them moment you walk I'm the front door, and I mean in a good way. The front desk Girls are on the ball and the same way with the young Lady(drawing a blank on her name) who does your vitals on right side of the office, That Girl is a go getter, very personable, hard working and just a very well rounded Nice Person, another great part of CPM Team. My Provider Lisa Gilliland and Her assistant are top notch as well. She spends quality time with me, asking and answering questions for me,, I feel like I get the care I need and they have helped me in so many ways and everyone's efforts are much appreciated. High 5 to Doctor Ball and His staff he has provided me with. You all Rock !!|I went two times to the Jasper location and both were terrible experiences. My first visit there they came into the room and immediately accused me of pain medication shopping because she thought I had 5 different doctors writing me 3 to 5 tremadol over the past 4 years, these doctors and nurse practioners all work for my same Dekalb doctor office. She apologized after I corrected that for her.
The second visit I was scheduled for 7:40 am , was the first person in the door when the office clerk unlocked it and over an hour later when the NP came to my room after I asked how much longer it was going to be, I asked her what time I needed to schedule my appointment to be seen at a more reasonable time and she , Christie, got offened. She then said I assure you that you were not the first person on the office and I asked her how the others got in and she said so you were standing outside the door when it was unlocked and I said yes. I also told me the only thing she assured me of is that she is a liar. She also told me the other patient had more issues than me, how she knows this I have no idea because I have never seen her before today. She then proceeded to ask me at what doctors office have I ever been seen at my appointment time, I assured her Dekalb you are always seen at your appointment time. She then stormed out of the room and was talking loudly about me to another lady in the office outside my door. I stood in the door and corrected her again since she obviously don't know how to tell the truth and was told to get out of that office that it was a medical office. The door was open and no where did it say do not enter. This place is a joke. They think your time is not as valuable as theirs even though they work for you as a patient. She also made it clear that they over book their appointments from the start of the day.
Do better people, MY TIME IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOURS AND IF I WAS AN HOUR LATE FOR MY APPOINTMENT YOU CAN BET I WOULDNT BE SEEN AND I WOULD BE CHARGED.|Nice office. Friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience. I would recommend to anyone.

3 stars because it isn't always easy to get through to talk to someone. You must leave a message and wait for a call back. Sometimes it's hours later or the next day. Occasionally it can be 2 days later. If you happen to miss the call you have to start the process all over. Also it is hard to call and get through on the weekends if having issues filling a medication.

If your pharmacy is out of your medication you may not be aware of this until it is time to fill it. If needing a script sent to a different pharmacy on the weekend because of this it is very difficult to even get the answering service to send the doc a message. They say you must wait until the office is open to discuss prescriptions.

They would definitely get 5 stars if it were an option to leave the doctor a message on the weekend, and receive a call back about it, if needing a script sent to a different pharmacy. It isn't ok to expect someone to go 2-4 days without medication that has been prescribed to them.

Another fix would be to give patients paper prescriptions instead of electronically sending it to the pharmacy where it can't be transferred if the pharmacy is out of the medication.

I'm sure this is an issue at all doctors offices, so ask any practice ahead of time what you need to do if this issue arises.",2025-01-16|2024-09-10|2024-10-27|2024-07-16|2024-09-23|2024-06-10|2024-05-28|2023-11-10,1|1|1|1|1|5|1|3,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|2 p.m.",91|87.5|84.5,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJSQElPZVlYIgRbWru5jxVVMo,46

The nurse who's been there 8 years was rude right off the start for no reason and honestly didn't seem like she cared about anything but her script she was reading off of, didn't let me get a word in and also was rude when I was leaving, making snarky remarks. I guess she's god, at least in her little world. Also the doctor was rude, uneducated &  seemed like he was on some type of speed by his movements, and itching swiftly - often with pinpoint pupils like he himself was on opioids. 10/10 front desk, 1/10 everything else. Definitely worth a look into to see if they are worthy of a medical license. Will be reporting nurse + the doctor to the appropriate agencies for a deeper review. No one who just wants help for a serious autoimmune condition should be treated how I was. The customers came in and left so fast reminded me of how pill mills ran pre-opiod epidemic. They assumed I was ignorant, had no connections ,and uneducated. The previous reviews are mostly correct, just from what I saw. Good luck.|This clinic refused to help me with my back pain and labeled me a drug addiction because I'm a convicted felon. I was manging my pain and than was put in jail for 2 1/2 years and when I got out I returned to this clinic looking for help and before they even had a mri done they asked me why it had been so long since I had seen a dr for my back and leg pain and when I told them it was because I had been in jail the dr immediately told me he would not help me because I was a drug addiction, he didn't even ask me why I was in jail. I never failed a urine test while I was there patient and always had an accurate pill count in the 4 years that I had been there patient before I went to jail. I pray that some day people are no longer discriminated against because they have a past. We all have a past.|Very heart breaking to go to this office for years.  And then one day, just treated horribly.  Would not even let me speak. Just talked over me.  Gave me an ultimatum that I could not even do.  We pay you for services!!! Yes you are a doctor and I respect that.  But you obviously had a God complex.  You have no reason to talk to people like they are the mud on the bottom of your shoe.  At least take time to talk to your patients.  You may learn something. Yes you're a doc. But you are in no way better than me.  I left that office knowing I would never step back in.

I went with her as I always do to be an advocate for her medical well being as I am more familiar with the field than she is. To say Dr. Quoc Tran was unpleasant to deal with is a severe understatement. He was exceptionally rude and condescending when asked a simple question about general success rates he has had with a nerve pain blocking implant. He boldly proclaimed it doesn't matter I don't talk numbers here's a pamphlet research it yourself. His general attitude and demeanor suggested that his intelligence far surpassed his need to show any common courtesy. He lacks the ability to carry a quality conversation in regards to his patients care. Truly disappointed with his behavior and overall rate of disrepair of this facility. If you are so miserable that you're carrying a loathsome attitude with you and displaying that towards your patients when asked a simple question you don't need to be in this field period!|I was treated very rudely. No one would listen to me. They had three of there staff in the room with me. Provider had her notes on her phone and nobody else looked at them . She accused the pharmacy of filling my prescription early. They were filling it every thirty days. Provider was not taking into account months that had thirty-one days. So on my last prescription, she told them to fill it on the same day as the last month. May has thirty-one days so, I was without my meds for one day. That was a horrible day for me to say the least.

Dr Tran got mad, then tried to say my med count was off. He told me he was kicking me out, I argued, and they recounted dates to find out my count was right. Then he tried to say my UA seemed off from January, so I needed to do a saliva test. Fine, no problem. What they don't realize, in February, I had a hair follicle for a job, so I knew he was reaching. I feel like just because I didn't do a shot in the neck, he was trying to find a reason to kick me out. He told me that if my neurosurgeon was thinking he may have to do surgery, he could take over care for 3 months.

It takes time to establish as a patient but once Dr. Sobey got to know me, he was able to diagnose and treat my conditions. I have my life back thanks to Dr. Sobey. There have been times when I had to see one of the fellows and had to hold back laughing when I was asked about using ibprofen (if that worked I wouldn't be a pain patient!) but I'm not going to come on here and leave a terrible review. Pain conditions are tricky, I think they do the best they can. I also know Dr. Sobey has had to go to bat with my insurance company many times, and I'm so appreciative. If you are considering becoming a patient, it's realistic to know you won't walk out of your first appointment pain free! That's not how it works. I've also had amazing care from the nursing staff.|My husband had 3 obligations.  Not much relieve. He saw nurse practitioner in September.  He was given a prescription for muscle relaxer.  He went to pharmacy today and they cancelled his prescription because they are not going to take Blue Cross Blue shield.  That is not right!! He was given excellent care but cancelling his prescription is just wrong.  He is a 77 year old Vietnam Marine veteran.  He never asked for pain medicine just the muscle relaxer.  That is how our veterans are treated.  You should be ashame.  Just bad.|They prescribed me an anti inflammatory without telling me the damage that it could do to the kidneys.  Never kept an eye on the kidneys.  I was admitted to the hospital
And stayed for a week because of the damage that one pill did to the kidneys.  They don't care.  The patient representative place that they tell you call.  WASTE OF TIME.  They back the doctors that don't know what they are doing.  No one cares about the patients!!!!!!!!|If I could leave less than 1 star I would. I was sent to them with SEVERE back pain from degenerative disks. The only thing they wanted to do to pad their bankroll was invasive, non-FDA approved, injections into my spine. I gave it a chance out of desperation and I'm in worse shape. They don't care about the patient. Only doing procedures to make mountains of cash. My back is worse from their ""help"". DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH YOU. If you need medication for pain, forget it here. Do not make these people rich at the expense of your health|OMG just when you thought patient care couldn't get worse, along came Vanderbilt Pain Center. Been trying for 17 days to get an appt merely scheduled and they said I needed to send prior spinal surgery records and a referral. So I've had not one but 3 prior doctors send the requested docs and yet they say none have been received. Have called 8 times and every time they say someone will call me back, but not one returned call. INCOMPETENT, UNCARING, and down right EMBARRASSING that this place bears the Vanderbilt name. Save yourself more PAIN and go somewhere else!|Dr Sobey treated me for chronic back pain and I can say he and the entire team were professional and treated me with respect.  The treatment suggested and completed by Dr Sobey resolved back pain I had for more than 25 years.  I am very pleased by my results and I have been pain free for more than 6 years.|This ablation is a miracle for me. I was born with scoliosis and continued to have degenerative problems.

I drove an hour to be seen for them to just give me a list of different doctors that do pain medication. I've been in pain management since 2015. All they mentioned was gabapentin and lyrica. I'll never come back. And to top it all off instead of helping me Dr mishra asked if I'd be interested in getting a referral to the weight loss clinic next door.

The staff are very rude, won't let you explain anything without cutting you off, the walls are thin and I could hear them talking about me outside the exam room, AND they make you feel rushed to get in and get out! I don't know if the appropriate individuals will ever read this review or if it will make a difference. But, as a healthcare professional myself, I felt it necessary to take time out to write this review. My pain issues are chronic, however, I just recently underwent a very painful surgery that has put me in EXTREME pain. Despite that pain, I kept a daily journal recording exactly when I took my regularly prescribed pain meds by the MRMG Pain Management nurse practitioners verses the ones prescribed to me by my surgeon. That was not sufficient enough at this clinic, as they released me as a patient on a contract technicality stating that I needed to have picked up the phone and called the clinic to tell them EACH time I had a prescription filled that was prescribed by my surgeon. The control substance site has a record of the fillings, notes from my surgeon were accessible to them via the Maury Regional computer system, AND my prescriptions were filled at the Maury Regional Outpatient Pharmacy with a date and time stamp on them.  Additionally, at my July 6th visit at the MRMG Pain Management Clinic, I informed the nurse and nurse practitioner that I had a surgery scheduled on July 14 th there at Maury Regional...AND, all of that was not enough! Really?!  What happened to grace for patients in compromised situations?!  I am and have always been a rule follower. I, personally, strive to treat my patients (no matter what meds they are taking) as human beings with feelings. I cannot AT ALL say that about this place! My hope and prayer is that for their existing, as well as future patients, this group will exercise grace and understanding with their patients. After all, patients like us who enter their clinic don't feel good in the first place! This entire experience has left me disturbed and very upset, all of which does not help with my recovery process from surgery.  Now, I am left to search for another pain management clinic feeling like I have a red X on my back. Why should I be left feeling upset and fearful that I will now be unable to be seen by another pain management clinic?!!!!  Furthermore, I will most likely have to go to a new clinic that is out of network causing me to have to pay $60 a month per visit!  Right now, that's a lot of money for me to spend, as I am unable to return to work due to recovering from surgery and because of situations secondary to Covid-19!|I have seen Dr. Welker who reviewed my medicines and made helpful adjustments. His explanations were well informed and appreciated. My regular NP and nurse have been patient and kind. After suffering at the hands of the scofflaws at PainMD it is awesome to have reliable, compent professional care available. I have serious doubts about the motives of the unhappy reviewers.

Sincerely, George Ogden|The doctor took one look at me and judged me from the start never-mind I'm passing there piss test bc I don't use but the tattoos had her looking down her nose at me like she knew me smh ...|I went here back in August of 23, wasted my time. I didn't go for pills, I wanted to discuss a permanent solution for my problem. The nurse basically came in, I told her and she said I would have to meet with the neurologist and they would call to schedule an appointment. I called them every week to follow up after a month I gave up and went to Maury Regional and had a great experience. Then 4 months later I received a bill, in my opinion they should have never given me a bill.|The entire staff at the new Columbia office are nice. Jamie is my doctor. She's easy to talk to and very professional. Dee is usually my nurse. He's very helpful. The girls at the front desk seem anxious to help.
Mike Bass|I can't say enough about this office. There was a mix up with my appt so they fixed it and got me in same day. Everyone is so nice in this office from front staff to back. The Dr was very nice and genuinely cares about what's going on. I look forward to my injection and feeling better soon!|My first appointment with Dr Schneider was great!  We set up a treatment plan for my severe migraines (I was having 20-25 days per month).  However, after the first visit, Dr Schneider didn't have time for me and his PA and NP decided to change the regimen that the doctor had set up.   Did I mention the constant turn over in this office?  I never saw the same person twice. I was not asking for narcotics or muscle relaxers,  I was desperate to be out of pain and I began to feel hopeless.  Of course my headaches came back with a vengeance and not to mention, I missed work several times with appointments, not drop-ins, only to get be told my Botox had never arrived when, in reality, it had never been ordered or it was being held in another office and they hadn't prepared for my appointment. The staff was flat out rude and did not have time to even say hello at check in.  I am a nurse, don't ask for much, but courtesy and competent care are nice to receive when you are in pain. I don't recommend this office unless you enjoy being treated like you are insignificant   This office cares about money, not people.  I would not recommend this office to anyone.|I sincerely thank the doctors, nurses, and all the office personnel for always treating my husband with all the great care and kindness.  I thank them for understanding his need to have me with him during his visits although COVID19 rules required differently.  If you need an understanding group you can't miss here.  They were always concerned about his pain level and worked for improvement|I would not recommend this place to anyone at all. The Dr. Does not care about the patients at all, she literally talks to you like you have a problem. My girlfriend was going here and we have her medical records and she is in very bad health and in a lot of pain everyday and instead of the Dr caring, the Dr walked in there and basically said she had a problem with pills qand that she wasn't taking them right! She only got them twice from this place, honestly, it wasn't even about that it was how the Dr spoke to her and treated her.

Great medical help with my painful back condition! I love my NP , her medical assistant, and Dr Fox !! They sincerely listen to my personal health issues and provide excellent advice and treatment. I highly recommend them!|I've been going there for aprox 10 years. Dr. Fox and Rachael Payne are Fabulous, so are my nurses and all the staff. They do a pill count and urine test  every visit to keep their patients safe. They don't give prescriptions without carefully evaluating us. They're the real deal.
Thanks everyone for such good care for the last decade. I so appreciate it. I wouldnt think of leaving!|When Pandemic first started I noticed that hardly no one wore a mask. I thought I had a very good relationship with them. There incompetence, their level of care was quite evident in the past year. You would think being a doctor's office they would know they need the a signature before sending a script to a pharmacy right? Or sending a script back with PA signature not Doctor. Waiting a week or more to get back with me when I left voice message. Everything seemed harder and complicated.

I used to love coming here & is such a shame how much this office changed this past year. I have been going here for 4 yrs and thought I had great relationship with them. They were always personable, very caring, chatted with me longer than 5-10 min, were on top of things, took great care of me and were very good at what they did. I even gave them excellent review 4 yrs ago. So I'm not just basing this bad review on 1 visit. It's based on many visits and many things. Provider even said to me that I was one of her favorite patients.

In the past my appointments usually lasted less than 1/2 hour & I was never late in 4 yrs and very rarely had to leave a voice message. Which they would return that day or the next day. Because I got caught in traffic jam, and (I had to go back home to get my mask bc I brought another purse & forgot it), I was 6 min late. I have never been late before. When I went out of my room to see what was going on I happened to have seen my provider go to another room & & I know that patient came way after me Ignored me and said I can make you wait 3 or 4 hours or as long as I feel like it! Im one person & your not the only patient here. You might be thinking this is stupid for me to react this way. But making me wait 2 hours bc I was 6 min late? It was based more on principle & thought I established personal relationship with them. It really bothered me. Now I have waited plenty of times when I went to doctor even 3 or 4 hours in fact. But never have I waited this long on purpose. And Im in my 50s. So this wasn't the only doctor I've been to and i know how things go by now.

Teresa|Was there for 4yrs, the nurse i had at first was great but when she quit. The other nurses kept asking me isn't there a clinic closer to you. They was determined to kick me out. I got covid and was at the doctors due to my symptoms getting worse which led me to be admitted to the hospital.  Before I went was admitted, I called to explain and they had dismissed me. Pretty sure that is illegal...|I have been going to Active Pain Treatment or about seven months and have had excellent care. Today I have my first injection appointment. Unfortunately, Dr. Fox does not provide injections at The Active Pain Treatment Center. He provides them at Fort Sanders West. When given the appointment I was told to go to ""Fort Sanders, 2nd Floor"". I should have asked for the street address. Instead I assumed their was only one ""Fort Sanders"" in Knoxville. After searching the facility for over an hour I finally figured out that I was at the wrong location! Please do not make the same mistake that I have. The correct location for injections with Dr. Fox is 280 Fort Sanders West Blvd. Knoxville, TN.|This is not a pill mill. If your looking for one dint waste your time.  I was with Active for 5 yrs and left due to personal reasons.  I was with a different pain clinic for 2 yrs. I regretted leaving.  I had no clue what my physical condition had in store for me.
These guys are top notch. They care. The 2 physicians I have are excellent.  Highly recommended pain clinic.|Really disappointed in their Covid precautions. Front office receptionist not masked and the nurse told us we didn't have to wear our masks. When asked why masks weren't enforced the nurse responded ""well if someone has a medical condition like claustrophobia we can't make them wear one"". What an absolute joke. My mom is extremely immunocompromised and this lackadaisical approach to health and safety is putting her life as risk. Shame on Active Pain Treatment. We will be seeking another practice that takes things seriously.|The Dr and NP treat you as though you're stealing from them.

When l started this pain management l was a mess! I had lots problems l was depressed because my health problems was so bad. I had to go in to early retirement yes sometimes l wouldn't like what Dr. Mollett and Michelle said however they listen to me and l listen to them and lam better now! I have two Bionic knees due knee replacement and my other problems are manageable.If you want a doctor that will fight with you on your health problems this the right place! Now l feel like my old self and l am  no longer depressed and l can't Thank you enough for putting up with Me Thanks Sallie Moreland|I recently became a patient of Dr Molett Nov 2023 due herniated disc (degenerative disc) , bludgeoned disc  diagnosed.   For the past 5 months, I've always was seen by the nurse practitioner (Michelle Lee). ! Whom is nice and professional!  My appointment in January was for a  nerve study test and I arrived on time, only to have to wait 30 minutes before the front office advised that the doctor would be another 30 minutes before arriving to the office. As a result I rescheduled the appointment.  I went to the rescheduled appointment, and the nerve study dr mollette completed was very painful and at the time I never was advised she was my actual doctor until yesterday !  She never introduced herself as my doctor!  She just came in asking me questions! Her interpersonal skills were very minimal in my experience with her! She talked to me as if I was a child, questioned me  about the integrity of my diagnosis my physician made! How professionally inappropriate, I was there for her to treat my diagnosis not for her to challenge my diagnosis!  During the nerve study she left the room serval times ! Yesterday appointment she had the Same lack of patient courtesy ! Not only did I have a urine test she also requested a swab test! Why 2 tests?  When I left the appointment yesterday I had a panic attack! I will not be returning!  And the front office (Santora) is very rude|PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW: My elderly mother was going there until today because she originally chose this doctor because it was close to her living arrangements (Antioch Office) but after two months they told her that she had to start going to the Smyrna office which is difficult for her due to transportation. They tried to string her along saying it was temporary only to learn they no longer have an office in Antioch.
Upon taking her to the office in Smyrna, I learned that she has to take her medication in every month putting herself and others in danger of a someone mugging her for her drugs. I understand having to do a pill count randomly, but to make patience bring their pills to the office each month is very risky. I wouldn't be surprised if this Clinic has been in previous trouble with the DEA And that's why they do that.
I also noticed that the office in Smyrna was very dingy and dirty, They have a TV in there but it's from 1999 when you could hardly see what it was showing Due to the screen and it being so small.
I would never allow my mom to go back to this Clinic Or do I recommend anyone sign up for I wished out to read the reviews before she made any type of appointment.|Showed up for my appointment 15 min early. They took me back to a room on time and the medical assistant told me that they are just cleaning the room where I would have my EMG test done and then they would move me into that room. I sat in the room for 1 hr and 10 min before they came to get me to move me into the correct room. Then, during my EMG test the doctors phone kept going off and she kept leaving the room to answer her phone. I understand if there is an emergency and you need to answer the phone but she left multiple times during my procedure and it felt very unprofessional. The whole feel of the clinic was very unprofessional and I really didn't feel super comfortable having my procedure there. I would 100% go somewhere ELSE next time.|I have been a patient for 10 years and can't say enough good things about Dr. Mollette and her staff. They have always been helpful and pleasant with me no matter what the issue was. Having been a patient of other clinics I realize how good this one is !|Had been going here for about 5 years. Had 3 back surgeries and major nerve damage...which Dr. Mollett diagnosed herself. All the great nurses have since quit, the office Mgr. is rude and extremely unprofessional. The best person still there is Michelle Lee, and the only reason I've stayed as long as I did. Like others who have left their reviews your generally not treated respectfully. There is a reason for so many negative reviews. Find another Dr. who will help you not take your money and mistreat you.|First off I've been in pain management before & I know you don't get meds on 1st visit, that's not what this is about. Before I went to my 1st appt I called to ask how much they charge to fill out paperwork (disability placard) because I wanted to just be prepared. The lady I talked to was so rude. She asked how could the Dr fill it out if she hasn't seen me. Of course I knew that. I told her I was just inquiring because all drs have a set fee. It was ridiculous. Well I go to my appt with my paperwork already filled out & I was early. I was called back quickly. I sat in the back 45mins before the Dr came in. She ran in & out handling something else each time cutting me off. She did apologize. But as I was trying to answer her questions & let her my problems she would interrupt & rush in to something else. Then turn around & ask me about what I was trying to explain. As someone else reviewed she was stuck on the back problem, when that's not my major problem. I even said to her that I had a problem with a Dr at my PCP office with Dr not listening to me repeating the same things to me & making me repeat myself because Dr wasn't listening. Dr molette said, I'll try not to do that. Then preceded to DO JUST THAT. I don't have a problem with taking drug tests. I did the urine. Then some very rude nurse came in & said they needed saliva which was fine. I had washed my hands from urine test & when she came in I was putting cream in my hands. She said uhh you put something on your hands. I said yea I DID. I didn't know she was coming. Then she said put this in your mouth & don't talk I mean don't say anything for 10mins. I was thinking who am I gonna talk to it's just me & her in the room. I will be changing. I see my PCP before I go back to them because I have appt for EKG. Overall I was in that room for 2hrs before the drug screening because the Dr was in & out & only spent maybe 30mins in total speaking with me. I would've appreciated if she would've finished up whatever she was doing before coming in to speak to me.|THIS PLACE GET ZERO STARSBUT IT WOULD NOT LET ME POST WITH OUT A STAR!  I have never been treated so badly in all of my life! I was treated like I was a drug addict trying to get a fix. I have been on 1 pain med for at least 15 yrs and have only gone up 5mgs in that time. She did not want to hear anything I had to say about anything. Because they did not get my medical records which my Dr's office tried to fax over 5 times she scheduled me for 3 MRI'S!!! I also had a letter on my medication that I do not tolerate acetaminophen and the 2 week script she gave me dated for a day after my meds run out has it in there!  I called when I left and noticed and I was told she was in a room someone would call me back well it is 10am the next day and I have still not heard from anyone!Had I read the reviews on this place I would have NEVER gone there it was close to my new job and in network for my new insurance.

Manny, the front desk Administrator is awesome and super easy to deal with and makes the overall experience very enjoyable.

I can't recommend enough- Go see Dr. K and change your life.|I have been seeing Dr. K for about 3 weeks now and he and Manny both have been nothing short of amazing. I herniated a disc a couple of years ago and recently was having symptoms of another bulge including severe pain and very limited range of motion.

My first visit Dr. K did a thorough exam and X-rays prior to any treatment. He explained everything to me each step of the way which made me much more comfortable with the process.

After just a couple of visits, I saw a huge improvement in my pain levels in addition to my range of motion and I have recommended N8 Health Center to many people who are dealing with aches/pains.

Looking forward to continuing being treated here!|My husband and I have been seeing Dr. K for a few years on and off now. I am 24 weeks pregnant and getting adjusted during my pregnancy has been game changer! We will never see another chiropractor.|I started seeing Dr. K at the Franklin location in October of 2024. My husband started seeing him in May 2024 for shoulder and knee treatments and suggested I schedule a consultation to see if he could help me as well with issues stemming from a couple of childhood injuries and a car accident when I was 18. The consultation visit was very non-threatening, he listened to what I said, and asked questions as necessary. On my first visit, he carefully explained everything before he started, and made sure I understood what he was going to do. After only 4 treatments, I am moving and feeling better than I have in over 20 years (I'm currently 52). I don't wake up in the middle of the night because of stiffness and pain, my back doesn't constantly ache, I can sit comfortably longer than I ever have, and I have a renewed enthusiasm for life again. Once we adapt my diet and schedule recurring maintenance adjustments, I am excited to continue with my active lifestyle - pain free! Dr. K and his assistant, Manny, make you feel comfortable, they listen to you, and they offer appropriate solutions to your specific issues. I honestly can't say enough great things about them!|I have been seeing chiropractors since I was 9 in 1957 and have had several outstanding chiropractors over the years including taking my brilliant chiropractor at the time to the 1984 USA Olympic Swimming Trials along with my 13 swimmers. Three of my swimmers made that Olympic team and I attribute a portion of the success to my chiropractor having every muscle in their body at top form as he worked with them weekly for a year. As an aside, by putting 3 swimmers on the Olympic team, I earned a spot as one of the USA Olympic Swim Coaches. But Dr K tops them all with his vast knowledge of the human body and his incredible ability to make adjustments including knowing which muscles are affected and how to stimulate them in a way that reactivates them. It is not just adjustments you get from Dr K, but advice on nutrition, exercises, how to treat an ailment without drugs and recommendations for such things as feasibility of stem cell injections or decompression therapy on one of his many decompression tables. If you have issues with joints, muscles, or pain, I highly recommend you see Dr Brandon Kassinger!|Best rehab/recovery experience I've ever had! Dr.K has helped me recover from an injury I've had for almost a year now. This is by far the best I've ever felt and I am at my all time best thanks to him. Cannot recommend him enough if you are looking to not only rehab injuries, but prevent them from happening all together. I only wish I found him sooner.|Dr. K provides incredible chiropractic service, expertise, and knowledge to assist the body in healing. He's not your typical chiropractor who just expects a crack and a pop with no lasting results. He will work with your body's needs so it can thrive again! Highly recommend him! Me and my husband have both experienced lasting healing results!!|Dr.K is the absolute best! I have been dealing with back pain from 20+ years of wear and tear on my body from playing sports.

She is kind and very empathetic.  She is thorough when you need her to be and is very quick when you need her to be.  Medical service here is by far the best for pain management.  I have only had one negative experience in my time there as a patient which was with one of the people whose job is answering phones and admitting patients.|They are rude treats everyone like they junkies sit at the desk and act like they don't see you to busy on their phones|I took my dad to Cordova Pain Specialists yesterday and things went amazingly badly. His appointment was at 3:45, but they ask for people to show up 30 minutes before their appointment They, therefore, wanted him there at 3:15. Life got in they way and we arrived at 3:34. They told him that he was four minutes past their cut off time and they wouldn't see him, he would have to reschedule for Monday. He had run out of his medicine that morning and I knew the arthritis and small fracture in his back would cause him to be in terrible pain in a matter of hours. I told them that he needed his medicine refilled and needed to be seen, we were only four minutes past the cut off, and not even officially late for the appointment, but they said rules are rules and if they broke them for an 87 year old man they would have to break them for everyone. I feel it is my job to advocate for my father because he is not very able to do it for himself so I told them that was unacceptable, he needed his prescription. They repeated that they would not see him, one person even came out and at first told me that it was the law, they couldn't see him that day. I told her I knew that was not a law at which point she admitted, it wasn't a law it was just their rule. My father was sitting down and did not hear any of this. I informed them that I was going to sit with my father until they found time to see him. A nurse then came out to be their muscle and told me I had to leave, to which I responded,"" You're actually going to kick an 87 year old man who needs his medicine out of your office?"" He told me he wasn't going to kick him out he was going to kick me out. I then pointed out that that was the same thing as kicking an 87 year old man out because I was not going to leave my father there when I left. This nurse bouncer then told me he would have me forcibly removed. To which I repeated that my father simply needed a prescription and asked if they couldn't just give that to him. It's a narcotic so, no they couldn't, which is understandable. I suggested again that they see him for just a minute so they could write his prescription. No. At this point my dad knows what's going on and is having a panic attack. While he's in this state I remind them that the Hippocratic Oath states that they shall do no harm. They insisted that they were doing no harm even though my father was having a panic attack right in front of them. I then started asking them if they felt good about what they were doing, if they were going to go home feeling good about the job they had done that day. I was saying all this calmly by the way, They then got on the phone to the sheriff's office to have me and my panicking, 87 year old father removed. I had started recording all this, except in my upset state did not actually do what needed to be done to record it so, no video. I had my arm inside the sliding glass so first they tried to close the glass on my arm then had a man grab my arm and push it back so they could close the window. I waited outside for the deputy so I actually could make a video of that. The deputy was wonderful and was sympathetic to an upset daughter trying to take care of her distraught father. He went in to talk to the people in the office to hear what they had to say, then told them that their rules were far to strict and if they had treated his father that way he would have done much worse than I did. Thank you Shelby County Sheriff Deputy for being so wonderful, shame on you Cordova Pain Specialists for being, in my opinion, so awful to an 87 year old man who was in pain and distraught. He felt totally betrayed by people he thought were there to help him. Maybe you think I was wrong or maybe you think I was right to insist, unsuccessfully, that they help my father but I thought it was important enough to make it known how he was treated.|My wife goes here she has sickle cell lupus and fibromyalgia.

I don't know why they haven't followed through with returning my call and scheduling the plan we made for treatment. I even checked with my insurance to see if they were waiting on approval from them and nothing has been submitted a week after my appointment.

So far I've had exactly the side effects he said I'd likely have the first two-three days afterward. I think I'm already feeling some benefit. This will be a long haul journey because there is currently no cure for my condition.

Dr Broadmax was horribly didn't even listen to us!!!! Did absolutely nothing to help!!!! Completely just shut us out!!! He wasn't even listening to us I also had to explain to him multiple times why I was there!!!
The lady that took my info and the reason why I was there got the whole entire story wrong and I have to repeat myself multiple times!!! Which was absolutely insane!!!!

Great job|I had 1 procedure that was failed and caused my spinal fluid to leak so Dr. Classen said I need a different procedure, so I scheduled another procedure. I get to the outpatient clinic, he's running and 1 1/2 behind. First I was scheduled for 8 am, the day before clinic called and said 10:15. Mind you I can't eat or drink after midnight. So I'm already not happy being switched to a later time with out anyone asking if this was acceptable. Then so at past 10:15 he's running a 1 1/2 behind. So I get into pre-op around 12 pm. Eventually Dr Classen sees me pre-op. I'm told he is now doing a different procedure than the one I was scheduled for; I should have left right then and there. I didn't because I felt forced to after waiting all that time, paid my account for the surgery center, and he has a month plus waiting time to get in a procedure. So that procedure failed too.

Randy is so polite and friendly, it's nice to see a smiling face when you enter. Chelsea is great and tries to help as much as possible, in office. My problem is when I call the office. I called in after my last SI injections bc I was concerned about the way I was feeling. I called in during business hours the same day. I told the person I spoke to that it was urgent that I get a call back before end of business day and no one EVER called back. Not that day, the next day, never! This is not the first time that I've had problems getting in touch with the office staff during business hours, it's impossible!!!|Dr. Burgess walked in and was very distant and flat in his tone. Didn't examine me, only glanced at my MRI imaging notes and immediately minimized my injury as only being ""small"", but he magically could see my pain was severe enough to schedule an injection within a week.

Even his scheduling coordinator said he never overbooked his procedures ""so he must see that you're in a lot of pain""(her words)

Even still, he only prescribed 1 week's worth of meds on an ""as-needed"" basis. He prescribed a month's worth of muscle relaxers, but only a week for pain. If you've ever experienced a herniated disk then you understand. When I called to inquire about the quantity, I was then dismissed again and told it was an issue with my insurance and their policy for prescribing pain medication.

Of course, I called the insurance company and that was absolutely NOT the case. They(Dr. Burgess' office) brushed me off AGAIN!!

Thankfully, my insurance company rep was willing to advocate on my behalf to get the office to prescribe another week of meds to at least get me to my procedure because they so obviously dismissed my concerns. They were also very slow about doing this.

The day of my procedure I never saw him before it was done or spoke with him after it was done. I never received a follow-up call about how I was doing or feeling. The injection provided approx. 12 hours of relief and then the pain was back worse than before.

I requested a refill of another week of meds to at least get to my next appt on 02.28 and was told no. I would need to discuss it with him at my visit. I have been in constant severe pain for DAYS!!!

It felt as if Dr. Burgess had a preconceived notion that I was a pill abuser and that my pain and discomfort didn't matter one bit to him. If I could give him '0' stars I would|I have been going here for over a year and a half... I wait EVERY TIME I go for at least twenty minutes after checking in. Then they never get my medications correct and I am always having to do all the footwork (I have neuropathy, so pun intended) just to get the prescriptions I NEED. I jump through all of their hoops and STILL I am currently waiting on a call back (50 mins now) just so I can pick up my prescription! It's insane, they are wildly unprofessional when it comes to handling their patients medicinal needs. Unreal, definitely looking for a new doctor/clinic.|If I could give ZERO stars I swear I would! Unfortunately the NP & the front office staffs I  have experience is great but OMFG that horrible prescriptions department, back office staff & Mira the Oncall person. They have made my experience there HELL. I have only been there just a few months & I hated it with a passion. Since dealing with them I have had to wait 2 different times each time with an almost 20-30 days gap in between my pain medication. Currently dealing with 2 torn rotator cuffs in 1 arm & a tear in the other. Let's not talk about if the pharmacy calls them to request ANY information to help with getting your medication to you they don't return call not even to them. I have never felt like a $ sign in my life until transferring to here. Please avoid this company at all cost until they staff realize your part of the reason their salaries are being paid. I'm in the medical field as well & best believe I am a patient advocate!|Dr Choudhri and her staff have picked up their game since I first started with them.

They answered my questions and provided me with valuable information related to post visit and for follow-up care. I highly recommend their services .|I did a lot of research and decided to make an appointment with Dr Wang. It was my first visit and I was very nervous.  As soon as I walked in my nervousness began to fade. The receptionist is very welcoming. Checked me in quickly with no issues. I met with Dr Wang and he took the time to explain the results of an MRI that I previously did in a way I could totally understand. He fully listened to my concerns and asked questions about my previous treatment.  I'm very impressed with his knowledge. He knew which areas of my back that needed improvement. I left feeling extremely confident I made the right choice. All the staff are so nice. Smiles from all!  I highly recommend him and look forward to my next visit.|Dr Davis made my injection experience amazing! I was a little nervous for the new procedure we decided on but he was so reassuring and calming which made me so at ease! My favorite part was he ended my procedure with a short prayer for healing! I was SO APPRECIATIVE!!! He has my complete confidence and I will refer him to all I come across that is seeking pain management! THANK YOU, Dr Davis and your Team! I am writing this 1 day post op and I already have relief!
GOD BLESS YOU!!!|Dr. Chapman is extremely professional. I went to see him for long standing back pain that other doctors could not help me with.  He found the problem immediately and promptly scheduled me for the first round of injections. They went smoothly and I didn't feel a thing. I think the best thing about Dr. Chapman is that he and his staff all take the time to actually listen to what I have to say.

We look forward to following his lead and using his expertise to move forward with pain management for my husband's back.

Very hopeful moving forward after a first round of injections. Pain definitely improved over night!

Everyone from Martha the front desk assistant administrator to Dr. Mehta (in the picture) was exceptional and professional.

It looks like we planned these outfits for the pic but Dr. Mehta is just FLY like that! That how you dress when you're the TOP DOCTOR in the field for 2025|I came here after an accident and my experience started out great, then went downhill. Getting an initial appointment was very quick in one day's time. Dr Mehta was great about referrals to physical therapy and pain medication/ordering imaging. Great doctor and no issues with him.

Getting a follow up appointment after imaging took a few weeks and when I finally did get the appointment, it was with FNP Cassandra Danek. Her bedside manner was very dismissive and for lack of a better word, lazy. I can tell she read my MRI results for the first time in front of me because she missed the very last page that showed a crucial result of my spine. I had to point it out to her on my end. What kind of physician skims MRI results? And so poorly?

Then she tried to diagnose me with a chronic disease for my clearly acute problem. I kept having to ask the questions and it felt like pulling teeth trying to get her to explain clearly why she thought I had this chronic disease. From there, she wanted to jump straight to an invasive surgery for me. I don't work in ortho, but I am a registered nurse who has taken care of plenty of acute pain injuries and it seemed like quite a stretch to give an otherwise healthy person such an alarming plan.

Thankfully I was able to get a second opinion elsewhere where the new physician disagreed with the diagnosis, gave less invasive treatment, and I'm doing much better without the procedure suggested here.|Everyone always takes great care of me. They also have sedation here. They take extensive measures to prevent mistakes, and the entire process is amazing from check in, to pre, intra, and post procedure. They also call to check on you which feels great.|When I called this office, Keisha was EXTREMELY rude and gave me nothing but attitude. She was not honest about the tasks she stated she completed and was super disrespectful. I could not believe how bad the customer service was. I have never written a bad google review before but I felt this time it was necessary.|PSA clinic & surgical center in Kileen, TX have the friendliest staff from receptionists , nurses, anesthesiologists,  nurse practitioners, etc.  Everyone is always happy & smiling when I'm there!  I've been seeing Dr. Mehta for years now.  He always explains things to me  & has helped me tremendously.  My husband & I trust him completely.  We live over an hour away from Kileen so that shows how much faith we have in PSA Kileen staff & Dr. Mehta!|Dr Chen. Was the rudest and worst dr I have ever had the misfortune of coming into contact with. He belittled me, made me feel unsafe not only while alone in a room with him. But also about my care. He would basically call me a lier on anything and everything I would say. He made me feel like I was not worthy of his care. Treated me like a lowlife recorded our conversation going aginst hippa. Dr Chen is hands down the dr from hell. His bedside manner is less than stellar. His ability to treat a patient with dignity and respect is gone. I do not believe he took his hypocrite oth seriously as all he did was harm. Treating me like I pill junkie while talking to me like I was. I do not need his kind of medicine or help. His help should be given out of care for his patients not forced on patients useing fear tactics. As he did me. He prescribed a medication that did not help only caused my already ability to not sleep to become worse. And then the kicker of this all. They get us on these pain meds. Then dangle them over our heads to sit up and bed. But when you fight back then you get treated like a second rate human. I didn't ask to be sent to him. Nor would I recommend anyone being subjected to this person. He needs to be locked out of the medical field as he is not fit for dealing with anyone who he deems not worthy of his time. I have filed a complaint with the medical licensing bord of texas and plan to take this as far as I can. Believe me when I tell you I have been being treated by Dr's since I was 7 years old and had many surgery's. I have never been treated as poorly by any of them as I was by Dr Chen. He makes me feel unsafe, threatened, and his general demeanor towards me. Was less than human as I had NO SAY in my treatment. He took that power away.

Avoid this doctor. He does not even feign interest when you share your concerns or symptoms. He prescribed me medication to help with symptoms I don't have. He completely brushed me off when I offered to connect him with my physical therapist regarding ongoing pain and medical conditions so that he could gain a better insight. I had even brought notes from said PT, and he did not want to look at them. My PT knows my condition better than anyone, so it makes no sense why Dr. Frederick was so disinterested in this information. He wanted me out of the door ASAP and did not want to discuss any options. *Not* LGBTQIA friendly.|Each time I see Dr. Gutierrez I am impressed.  He is easy to talk to and answers my questions thoroughly.  Dr. Gutierrez is truly an advocate for his patients and has really helped get the care I need for my back approved.  I highly recommend him!!|I was referred here by another practice where I was getting my chiropractor physical therapy treatments from. Although it may have taken a while for me to actually get my initial appt scheduled and then a little longer before I actually saw the Dr, well I can see why now. Dr. Gutierrez is amazing with an excellent bedside manner. He listens. He cares. And he understands. He genuinely wants to help get to the root of your pain and nip it in the bud. On a side note, I really love how this Dr is also from Austin. Born and raised.  true Austinite. Not too many of us still around but ironically somehow we still seem to always end up finding each other along the way... making it feel like it's still a small town. Idk it just makes me feel like ""home."" There couldn't have been a better referral choice for a pain specialist. I'm happy with the turnout so far. All the staff  from the front desk to the nurses station to the surgery center have all been extremely nice and pleasant to work with. Thank you.|I would like to say ' THANK YOU!! ' to the entire staff. I receive EXCELLENT care from the time I enter and check-in, to being seen promptly and even early (when I get there early) by the practitioner ,to my labs. My time is valued without feeling rushed. Thanks to the staff efforts to educate me I have a better/comprehensive understanding of my healthcare as a whole to include and how my medical plan benefits work.|My first appointment with them, but my wife has been a patient there for a few months. I was seen by Kaycee - and wow, what a blessing she is! Very kind, empathetic, and knowledgeable. In a half hour, she diagnosed me with something that no one has ever mentioned to me in decades of looking for relief. Dr. Gutierrez will be treating me for it soon. An entirely positive experience.|I loved how fast and nice they were! Once the doctor realized i had numbing in my body during my first appointment he was worried! The staff was so polite even to the older patients that most other places tend to not be very impatient!

Everyone from the practice that I had any contact with was very nice and helpful with anything that I needed. As I looked online at reviews for some guidance with which pain management center to go to, I kept reading how many patients commented on how pleasant and helpful the office personnel and doctors were. I found this to be very true.
Dr. Julia was on time for my appointment, and he was very personable and he took time to listen to what I had to say.
Dr. Julia was aware of my issues as he had already studied my X-rays, MRI's, and previous doctors notes. We discussed various details and possible treatments. We agreed on a treatment, and to my surprise there was an appointment available in only two days in which I eagerly accepted. I am eager to begin treatments with Dr. Julia, and I feel like I will be getting top notch care.|I'd like to give a shout out to the admin staff as well as Dr. J!

My wife and I were in an urgent care situation, and stumbled across the office in San Marcos at 5pm on a Wednesday. The medical assistant on duty gave us intake paperwork and got us scheduled first thing the next morning. We stopped in at the Kyle location the next morning and learned that the doctor we needed for treatment was in Austin. We were promptly rescheduled, and checked in within an hour. This is what medical care should look like!

Dr. Julia rapidly diagnosed the situation without making my wife jump through hoops that would cause more pain. He promptly provided treatment, coordinated follow-up, and gave us next steps.

After a tough week with little to no help from other care providers, Greater Austin Pain Center was a breath of fresh air!|I felt heard about my back pain history and received constructive feedback from doctor Hynes.

I was so lucky to find Dr Candice Burnett at this practice and was so happy to hear she was leaving this practice last MAY! I have been requesting my chart to be sent for 6 months now! They don't answer my phone calls or return them!

Dr. Hirandi was my original doctor for 4 years! When I first met him I was so hopeful at this point you can tell he is burnt out. He told me he hates being a doctor anymore because of insurance companies! He spoke to me so disrespectfully that I immediately requested to be transferred to another doctor as he couldn't care less about me as a patient! Now they are holding my chart/imaging hostage.

Also in 4 years Dr. Hirandi would keep me waiting a minimum of two hours. Appointment times here don't matter. They have no respect for the patients time.

I promise you can find a better Pain management clinic!!!|Dr. Zehra Hooda is the kindest, most caring, and brilliant physician I've met. She wants to help and does everything possible to improve quality of life. You can tell she cares deeply about her patients. I live two hours away, and she is worth every time I have to stop to stretch and every traffic jam to get there. Their facilities and staff are excellent, and the name ""Modern Pain Management"" is the perfect description. Many services offered I was not even aware of. I was scheduled for a fusion surgery in my lower back, but I had them take me off the schedule after my consultation with Dr. Hooda. She has discussed multiple treatment options that I never heard of from local physicians. I had a caudal injection with anesthesia in their Sugar Land location. It was so much easier than having to do it at an outpatient center, get checked in, and not being charged extra facility fees. I actually felt much more at ease and was given better attention at their facility. Dr. Hooda even came in before the procedure and explained what she was going to do, what to expect, and asked if I had any questions or concerns. If you're scared of another surgery, or have pain that affects your quality of life, then I definitely recommend Dr. Hooda and Modern Pain Management.|Just leaving this review on general principles. Never actually been there. They called my office mistakenly and said I had missed an appointment and they were applying a no show fee to my account. Firstly, how can you be so disorganized that you call the wrong number and then not even make note that the name on the voicemail doesn't match the name of the patient being called? Super unprofessional. Secondly, no show fee? Really? Who actually does that to their patients? Anyways, this seems like a sketchy place to be avoided.|Had lumbar injection yesterday and today I am feeling much better.   Surprised I was not given any information on what to do, or not to do.
A bit of a problem communicating with the office, but I'm happy with Dr. Harandi.|He is exceptionally knowledgeable and truly cares about his patients. His expertise in pain management, combined with his compassionate approach, makes him stand out in his field. I highly recommend him for anyone seeking effective and personalized pain relief.|I have been in a lot of discomfort for years. My neck and left shoulder has been the cause of so many painful days. A neighbor of mine suggested Modern Pain Management. I had all my paperwork done in advance which really helped speed up the process. I also collected all my MRI results in advance and brought them with me. I certainly didn't want to go through another MRI if I didn't have to.
Dr Atallah met with me. He listened to me. He didn't rush me. He was prepared. I'm not going to lie they will weed out scammers and people just looking for meds real quick. I'm clearly not one of those people. I didn't want any pain pills at all. It's not my thing.
Dr Atallah is a cool guy. He is not stuffy, he jokes with you, he listens to you and asks questions. Caroline one of his nurses stood out to me. She was super friendly and helpful. I didn't feel rushed in the least.
I was able to have 4 trigger point injections on my first visit. Two days later I feel a lot better. I'm not perfect. But it's a very good start. I'm able to do all of my normal tasks without discomfort. My goal is to have better range of motion with no pain. I'm not sure if this is going to be possible but only time will tell. I highly recommend Dr Atallah.|I have severe arthritis that  I have been seeing Dr Harandi for over 5 years. I have undergone several rounds of spinal injections and then a spinal cord stimulator  implantation. As a chronic pain patient there is a medication regimen the Dr has instigated.  I have a monthly tele visit as well as quarterly office visits. The purpose being to continue the medication plan as Dr prescribes. He has always been empathetic to the fact that I want to continue to work in my business and use his treatment plan to that end.
However, the office staff is the most aggravating group of people I have  ever dealt with. The simple task of  renewing prescriptions has been done wrong for the last 7 months.When I try to get some help with the issue I was blamed, the pharmacy was blamed, in spite of the fact that this office has been notified  via 3  separate means7 times over the last 90 days of this issue, no one will listen at all to what is told to them. No one answers the phone when a lab calls to try  to clarify the orders sent, a pharmacy cant get any response, and dont even try to speak to anyone as a patient. When I called to try to get  this confusion sorted , I was told it would be 90 dollars to speak to Dr Harandi, in spite of being in office last week  paying the 90 dollars for a 4 minute visit. The staff was unwilling to even listen to my points, talking over me the entire time I attempted to make a point and there is no way to reach anyone there directly, texts and emails are ignored.  After finally getting a human on the phone I was placed on hold for 54 minutes, then hung up on. The IRS has better customer service skills.
I am scheduled for a neck surgery next week and Dr Harandi stated he wants to be on the case, yet it is impossible to speak to him about it. Due to the intransigent nature of his office staff I dont see how he ever gets anything accomplished.  I have near zero confidence in this office staff to be able to perform as needed for post operative care.
A review posted yesterday was scrubbed from Google.|This office was recommended to me by a customer a few years ago. Dr Harandi, has been very empathetic to my maladies. However, his office staff is absolutely the most aggravating group of people I have ever dealt with. The lab orders and the prescription refill orders  are seemingly simple tasks. Yet month after month, 7 months running they have been done wrong. I have endured 43 days of no medications in the 7 month period due to the sheer ineptitude of this staff. The issues at hand have been discussed, emails sent, voice mails left and all are ignored.It is IMPOSSIBLE to get the phone answered, and you will never be able to speak to Dr. Harandi unless you pay first, even though I was calling about a problem with the staff that they will not admit to or attempt to remedy. They simply dont care at all.
I have an upcoming surgery that Dr Harandi stated he wants to be involved in post operative care.I  have no confidence in the ability of this office to be of any help in spite of his good intentions.",2024-10-30|2024-10-19|2024-12-17|2024-10-18|2024-08-09|2024-03-09|2024-03-13|2024-03-12,1|5|1|5|5|5|1|1,,,,,"Onsite services, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What do they do here","We treat any pain",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJzf9unbvEQIYRXMrtitsK87E,193

Was not greeted upon entering clinic by the blonde girl (no nametag).

Clinic signs expressing things like 'Karen will NOT see late patients so PLAN AHEAD' were all over the clinic, made it look cluttered, unprofessional and unwelcoming (honestly, tell me you don't trust your patients without telling me you don't trust your patients...). It's ironic because when you sign up to go to this clinic, you sign pages upon pages of acknowledgements basically agreeing to similar demands. It'd be nice if they didn't treat patients like forgetful children. Edit: for the record, I was on time.

Front desk girl threw urine cup at me when I asked to go to the bathroom after I'd waited in the exam room for an hour. Her excuse was ""depending on what the doctor will give you"" but I was not there for narcotics (which frankly was none of her business anyway).

The doctor was thorough with my health history and questions (which is the only reason I'm not giving a one star).

However the doctor took over an hour to arrive in exam room (honestly I almost left, and the blonde front desk girl was catty and rude when I indicated such to her). I was not the only patient to complain, as I overheard other patients talking to the front desk about the delay time with waiting for providers while I was leaving. If the patients are being demanded to be on time, the doctors should also comply.

When I got outside, another front desk staff was in heated discussion with a lost driver and patient in the parking lot (from what I'm assuming was another facility). Not a great experience, won't be back.|Dr Terry Latch and NP Karen Albright are a great team. Dr Latch has a light touch with injections. I'm a nurse, and pleased!|Dr Latch is cool but the foreign people that answer the phone for appointment cancellations are ridiculous.   I canceled 8 minutes shy of 24 hours and he insisted I still had to pay the cancelation fee.  I'm glad I'm moving to my new provider just so I can speak to US based call centers and stop getting nickel and dimed for nonsense.|I literally made appointment in the morning with sonterra clinic. Grace or someone called me, claiming I didn't talk to her in a scolding, disrespectful manners. Then punish me but canceling my appointment. They wouldn't tell me if she is CMA, CNA etc. I want to complain on her and fake boss to the texas license board. Please post the license of your staff and don't let them run the place to ground. I hope then can hire people who grow up with manners.|I was referred to Texas Pain Physicians by another doctor a little more than a year ago.  The main pain management doctor has left and now Dr. Latch is in the lead.  Today I had a routine visit with RN, AGACNP-BC Karen Albright.  As I entered the waiting area, I was greeted by Connie and Nikki.  Connie logged me in and Nikki took my vital signs.  Both of the ladies were very polite, courteous and friendly.  Then I visited with RN Albright.  I had visited with her before and this time was all the same.  She is a very professional, attentive, caring, and patient health professional.  We had a thorough conversation and she immediately ordered the medications I needed.  I could not have asked for anything more.  Though I have not been seen yet by Dr. Latch, both Connie and Nikki were very complimentary about him.  I highly recommend Texas Pain Physicians.  Great clinic!!|This practice was top-notch with Dr.Escontrias. Unfortunately, he left the practice and they brought in the worst doctor I've ever met. Dr Neleson! I think he gets pleasure from sabotaging treatment for patients that truly suffer from chronic pain! Even performing back procedures without an MRI to fully understand the areas needing to be addressed. Then bending my daughter in all kinds of contorted positions telling me I'm fixed. She began to feel pain that she never felt before. And then questioning lab results even after her being under a doctor's care in a hospital. Unbelievable! I'll never take her back there!|Everyone is so nice and proactive. From the front desk to the procedure rooms, Sarah (nurse), Joseph (nurse), financial department (Josie), Kiki (aid), Conny (nurse & manager), and the doctors Karen & Dr. Neleson are all super helpful & professional. I can trust my health at this place.,|Karen is truly exceptional! From the moment I entered the doors to the office, I felt welcomed, cared for, and completely at ease. She has always gone above and beyond to be sure that my complete health and wellness have been made a first priority.
She's extremely knowledgable and personable. Not once have they ever run late for any of my appointments.The office is inviting and the staff members are friendly and helpful in every way.

Dr. Mahreen Iqbal and her Husband for the pain treatment.
Thank you Dr.Mahreen Iqbal for given back my life.

First visit. Staff is very friendly and courteous Michelle helped me getting referrals from my PCP to expedite the process and Dr.Iqbal is very nice and understand my concern.I would recommend to my friend and family 
2nd Visit for the follow up with Dr.Mirza was also very positive and pleasant.|Dr. Iqbal has truly been a blessing in my life! After a difficult year of surgeries and pelvic/ back chronic pain, I felt like other doctors were just brushing me off, not taking my pain seriously or trying to find a solution. But Dr. Iqbal listened to me from the very start, something I hadn't experienced in a long time. She took the time to understand my concerns and came up with a thoughtful treatment plan that would help alleviate my pain. Gave me options and explained in depth why I should take which route of treatment plan and etc , felt super comfortable and confident with the treatment plan we decided to go with.  Michealle, Dr. Iqbal's medical assistant, Called  multiple pharmacies to find a pharmacy that could make a specific compound medication for me, super thankful.  She's always so welcoming and takes the time to listen to my concerns. Michealle is not only sweet and kind but also incredibly informative.
When I went in for my epidural injection, the entire team made sure I was completely at ease. Her entire staff is just as amazing! From the moment I walked in, Aly  greeted me with warmth and made sure I felt welcomed and comfortable during pre-op and the procedure. They helped me relax even though I was nervous, and during the procedure, I didn't feel any pain--just a small pinch. It was quick, and when I stood up, I could already feel relief, which I hadn't felt in a long time! I am so grateful to Dr. Iqbal and her entire team for their compassion, dedication, and outstanding care. They've made all the difference in my journey to healing!!!!!!|Marvelous visit . Everyone wad so kind knowledgeable and concerned about my needs.   They were transparent and talked with clarity.  They immediately gave me help so as to make me comfortable, remove my fears, established rapport.   I am so happy I went to them, and my doctor was kind and thorough.  Anxiously awaiting my  results, which I just feel will be great and long lasting.  If I were to give this place a report card grade,   A+....... Oh yeah!'n|This office is a joke.  The girls who answer the phone are rude and condescending and have ZERO Customer service skills! My daughter, who has 2 insurances, was told they would not accept insurance for the nerve block shots she needed.  She called me crying, she was in pain, she needed the shots.  I didn't have time to think or question why they wouldn't bill insurance, so I just paid the $500.  Later I found out the shots would've been covered under our insurance had they allowed her to use it. I made numerous phone calls to them, and their explanation was that since she chose to have the shots the same day as the office visit , they only take insurance for the office visit. Huh? That doesn't make any sense to me.
I asked to speak to the doctor, and they said the doctor doesn't come to the phone. like I said ZERO customer service.  They Did not offer to take a message for her or anything.  I asked for the Person who does their billing, And they said she doesn't work in office.  Ok... So how do I contact her? They gave me her email so I emailed her but She never replied.  I contacted our insurance, and because they never received a claim from the doctor (bc remember the doc wouldn't bill them)  they said the only thing we can do is file a grievance against the doctor.
In my opinion, What this doctor did is bordering on unethical.|Dr. Iqbal is great! The whole staff is professional and welcoming. They care about their patients and actually listen. Best place for any back or spine related issue. I've been suffering with sciatica for years and now after one procedure my back and leg pain is gone. I highly recommend Dr. Iqbal and Michealle!|Dr. Mehreen is a very professional and a very patient listener and gives full attention to the patient. Her PA Michelle is very courteous and polite.

However, their office staff leave MUCH to be desired. They are not only unfriendly, many are downright rude. As a pain patient, I feel like compassionate, kind, patient, and understanding staff should be a given. But that has not been my experience. I know they have a lot going on to run the office but patient care should be at the forefront of their priority list.

I was turned away and rescheduled because I was four minutes late. I was told they do not have a grace period for late patients. When I pushed back, I was given a print out of paperwork I had signed in January that they had highlighted to show me their ""policy."" It would only said ""be on time for you appointments.""

I see MANY doctors for my condition and have never been turned away if I'm within 15 minutes of my appointment. The office staff were dismissive, rude, and uncaring.

It's unfortunate because once I see Dr. Chouteau or Dr. Patel, I do feel very valued and cared for. Their nurses are kind, as well. But up until then, the office staff treat me as though I'm just an interruption and that they could care less about me as a patient.|I love Dr Chouteau. I dont like having to come every month just to refill medications and vitals and urinate in a cup. I have been disabled since 2009 and have been through different therapy and medications. I dont like all the calls from different people just to satisfy Well Med and other programs. This is really annoying and makes me not happy. I wish someone will listen and stop interferring with my personal life. I use to see the pain doctor every 3 months but Well Med changed it to every month for everyone. I dont think it is necessary for me. I am discouraged and dont want to do it. I try now but dont know how long I can continue. I have other doctors to see but often put them off because of pain and barely able to move sometimes.|Dr. Chateau and her staff are very professional and everyone has such positive attitudes.  I absolutely love my NP, Miss Patel. She is extremely knowledgeable and has the perfect demeanor. I never feel as if I am just a number.  I know I am  in good hands, which means the world!  I highly recommend Dr.  Chateau !|I love love here. I am well taken care of and I highly recommend Dr. Chouteau and her team.
Shefali is one of the nurse practitioners and I saw her and she was so kind and listened to me and wasn't in a rush.
Her nurse today was Bailey and she was fantastic!|I have been coming to the clinic for over a year. They're very professional,curious and polite. All the doctors actually listen to you. It's hard to find a good doctor and one that shows empathy|Dr. Chouteau has been treating me for spinal stenosis pain for five years. The care has been excellent. I feel fortunate to have Dr. Chouteau managing my care. Everyone at Texas Pain Physicians is professional and friendly.|I've been a patient of Dr. Whitney Chouteau for about 3 years. Ultimately, I wish that she and her physician's assistants could be my primary care doctors. In addition to the nurses and staff, they all represent the best medical team I've ever seen.

Here's the main reason:

Relationships are best judged by how a person handles the tough days. Dr. Chouteau and her team are there for me on my toughest days. They're steady, they don't get rattled. You'd never know that they have bad days, too. They operate by the book, but the human element is never lost.

You don't often find an entire medical team who can balance empathy with professionalism, and this office has consistently perfected that balance during the 3 years I've known them.

This is essentially a thank you note to this facility. They've listened to me, reasonably managed my pain issues, and helped me maintain the healthiest life I can live.|I have been coming to Dr Choteau for years now. Today trying to verify insurance coverages and which way would be cheaper, over 30 minutes and whomever handles that part, because it's not the ladies in the front, taking their sweet time as if I can sit here and miss my appt time and other things that need to be done.

He had an X-ray of my hip and treated me for months with no relief. I even had to be wheeled back in a wheelchair. When I finally decided that was enough and said I was going to my orthopedic surgeon for an xray. Azzam wanted to do an X-ray there. HE HAD AN XRAY WHEN I CAME TO HIM because I was referred by my spine surgeon. I went to my orthopedic surgeon and he asked me with just a short exam, ""What took you so long?"".  So I was in severe pain for months while Azzam ""treated"" me. My family can attest to the FACT that I could not walk at all without being bent over and holding onto things the entire time I was being ""treated"" by Azzam. I couldn't stand up or sit down without excruciating pain.. I needed a hip replacement which Azzam knew I needed from the start! This man must be blind or just doesn't care. You decide!|I have been a patient of Dr. Azaam's for years.  He is an amazing doctor, and has given me back my life by eliminating my back pain.  Rachael Thompson, P.A.,  is extremely knowledgeable and solved my headache issues.   The staff is incredibly kind and professional. I highly recommend Advanced Pain Management to anyone who is seeking pain relief.|My first visit to Advanced Pain Management with Dr. Mohamad Azzam was definitely a 5 Star Visit. I was greeted from his staff with smiles and promptly finished up with paperwork and co-payment. Only a very short wait before being escorted into the exam room. This is where I met Dr. Azzam. He showed genuine concern on the amount of time I was in pain. Went over my X-rays and MRI results with me and all forms of medication and treatments I had already received. We discussed my options. This was on a Wednesday. I was scheduled to come back on Friday just two days later. I chose to get an injection in my SI joint to start treatment for my hamstring/sciatic nerve pain. I chose to have the injection without anesthesia.
Truthfully, I was a nervous wreck, which I kindly explained to Dr. Azzam. He had a warm bedside manner and explained everything step by step. He was very gentle, and the best part is, it was not bad at all! I did experience some pain 1 hour after returning home. He told me this might happen. His nurse contacted me on the following Monday, assuring me everything I was experiencing was Normal!
Each day I started feeling better and better. I feel I was 75% better after 1 week. Now it's been 2 Weeks and I feel I'm 100% pain free. I highly recommend Dr. Azzam. If you've tried PT, Chiropractic Care and manipulations, acupuncture  & pain meds with no success, I suggest you give Advanced Pain Management a try! I did, and couldn't be happier with my outcome. 6 months of constant pain was way too long! I hope this review is helpful.|Great place to receive care! Dr.Azzam is very caring/professional and does his best to make sure my needs are met. His nurse practitioner is amazing as well! Love this office and the staff.|Dr. Azaam was a very nice doctor but his front office was very  rude and not helpful at all. I was going there to get a  couple injection and I needed a Prior Auth for my insurance to cover it. My first scheduled injection was cancelled the day before because they had not got my PA back. Okay fine I understand. I call Monday because I called my insurance to see they did my Pa and the insurance company said they never got anything from this office. So Dr. Azaam office staff tells me well we havent done it because I have to call your insurance and stay on hold for an hour so we havent done it. So what were you going to do call me Thursday and cancel my appointment again?? Thats not how you treat patients I was in alot of pain. But thankfully I found a Pain Clinic that actually cares. Beware if you're in pain they don't care.|Be sure to check other sources for reviews as well.

This place does not care about you whatsoever. They care about your money. Some compassion when dealing with people who have life altering injuries could go a very long way.

This is a very cookie cutter healthcare kind of place. I have an L4/L5 injury. The disc is over half way out and pushing on the nerve affecting my right and left leg.

I went to my first visit desperate for help. I tried asking questions (because not being able to feel your leg can be extremally scary turns out) Dr. Azzam talked over me and told me the plan was for a pack of steroids and a spinal injection which we did.

It offered temporary relief but not sustainable. The questions I had were which exercises I could do, what stretches would help, what the next plan would be, but he only had interest in getting to the next patient.

I was told to do core work but not which ones are safe, I was told light weights only but couldn't give me a number. So I tried working out again based on the extremely limited information I was given between my $500 worth of visits and the pain got worse.

I was supposed to have a follow up the day after Christmas and I did not have another $150 available for it, so now that I got that money together and attempted to schedule they have a $35 fee tacked on that they refuse to take off because I didn't come to my appointment (even though I left a message, its all I could do they were closed)|Dr, Azzam and staff are always friendly and courteous to my needs. They continue to identify different avenues of treatment in an effort to relieve my pain permanently, rather than just coping with the pain. They have went above and beyond helping with my insurance to get approval for procedures and  they are always focused on my needs during each appointment and I never feel rushed. I would recommend this office for all your needs, if your looking for someone to focus on your health in a clean and a respectful environment, than this is your  place.|So a few years ago they were great! Apparently they have had some office staff turnover and it's horrible. I called on Monday got an appointment for today  Friday at 10:00 am just to arrive and find out there was no appointment on the schedule for me. I asked the receptionist if she could ask one of the providers if they would see me. She simply replied ""No they are with patients.""  Which was a full on lie. I saw Rachel, NP go into an office on the side of the front reception and Dr Azaam walk through the reception desk area. Neither were in a patient care room at the time. I've gone here since 2020 but I guess this girl is new and didn't realize I know the providers. They actually made a point to tell me my employers didn't send them referrals.  Anyhoo, go somewhere else.

Dr Morsy listens, he takes care of his patients and I'm always referring him to my family and friends. He's taken care of my pain and I can't be more thankful|I do not recommend this office. They clearly view patients as numbers and not individuals. I have been a registered nurse for 17 years. I have suffered from chronic pain most of my life and simply needed a Tramadol prescription, which I use responsibly 2-3 times per week for rheumatoid arthritis pain. Unfortunately, I cannot get this from any of my 6 other doctors, due to the strict narcotics laws in place. I spent 3 hours for a new patient visit. I was told to come one hour early to fill out paper work. Who does this anymore? Medical history papers should be emailed or filled out online before the visit in this modern era. I arrived 30 minutes early, because I am a pro at filling out my medical history. After finishing my paperwork, I proceeded to watch everyone else in the office who had arrived after me be taken back to a room. After mentioning this to the receptionist, they promptly found a room. While waiting for the doctor, I heard a nurse loudly gather all the staff to celebrate a birthday party in their break room. What a sign of disrespect...keeping patients waiting while the staff is socializing. They also kept all the exam room doors open, thereby violating HIPAA. The doctor was kind but brief, like most doctors. Again, patients are a number and billing code, not an individual. There are better pain management practices out there. My motto is the doctor is only as could as their office staff.|If you look at the 1-star reviews, they're here for a reason and aren't a joke. After going to his office for over a year he severed our relationship due to... get this... asking questions. He didn't want to allow me to use my insurance's pharmacy anymore so I asked why. Apparently that's asking for too much and makes his nurse practitioner ""uncomfortable."" I tried to get them in touch with my pharmacy (which is a government-run one, not a small one), and they refused to speak to them while just stating that they can reject any pharmacy they want and don't have to say why. It's the only pharmacy I could use that wouldn't be charging ridiculous amounts since it's the only one in-network with my government insurance and he ended up just deciding to tell me I was dropped as a patient due to asking questions that made them uncomfortable. That's the amazing service you'll get there -- I guess it's good for someone that wants to just sit lifeless while his office staff does whatever they feel like and you're walking on eggshells afraid to say or ask anything because you don't know how they'll retaliate. Seriously, if you don't believe this, read the other reviews. If one is a coincidence and two's a pattern, what is it when 15+ are all complaining about the same issues?|The experiance was extremely painful. Since visit have pain from treatment that my prescrition pain medicatin cant stop. My treatment has put me in such pain at wakes me up at night and have lost use of right arm witout pain from treatment|I would never recommend this place.
I have never been so dismissed by a doctor like I was by Dr Morsy and his assistant. I had MRI's done and he said we will do injections I asked him to explain to me why I needed them, he said he would hand me the report to read. Umm no explain it to me. He told me a few things and then said his assistant could tell me, handed her the paper and walked out. She said I can tell you are frustrated and then she handed me the report and walked out. I was shocked at the way I was treated.|Im not the one to normally rate and much less write a review. But I have never been so upset with a doctors office until today. Worst experience thanks to a nurse practitioner. I have not been a patient very long. Dr. Morsy is wonderful. And his staff is great as well. His office manager is outstanding! But Dr. Morsys nurse practitioner is a JOKE. I have never met such a terrible nurse practitioner like her. She does not care one bit. The first time I told myself maybe because I was new. But this last time I saw her she did not give me one chance to tell her my problems. She walked in didn't say one word or ask one question and much less did not give me a chance to ask or tell her anything. She's a waste of time for sure. But again thank you to the office manager Mrs. Olga she listened to my concerns and problems. For now on I will make sure to see Dr. Morsy and him only.|I have been a patient of Dr. Morsy for several years and he and the staff at Tx Pain Physicians are always so nice and helpful. If you have a problem or question you will always get an answer. The girls at the front desk always greet you with a smile and the nurses in the back are very comforting if you are nervous about a procedure you are scheduled for. The office manager comes up to speak to me every month when I have my appointment just to check on me and ask how I have been doing. I highly recommend if you need pain management.|I am a patient at Texas Pain Physicians in Rockwall. My doctor Amr Morsy is wonderful. I have been with them several years and have received the finest of care. His staff, especially Olga and Joey are exceptional! Warm, caring, and professional.

He helped me when I had really given up on getting any pain relief in my lower back.

I didn't expect any different results than the previous injections, therapies, and procedures but I was pleasantly surprised! He listened to me and came up with a great plan that has given me the most relief to date. He has a great support staff helping him as well. You will not be disappointed!!|Dr. Abdelfattah is truly dedicated to improving his patients' quality of life. Dr. A's approach is not only comprehensive but also tailored to meet individual needs.

He is very compassionate, straightforward, and explained treatment options clearly. He asked for my input into my treatment plan and gave me pros & cons for each decision. Plus, the staff in his Plano office were simply wonderful. They were organized, so friendly, and moved mountains to get me the necessary appointments.

Dr. A very professional and cares about his patience and their comfort.

I changed to Chronic Pain Relief and ""Dr A"" 6 months ago and have been 100% happy that I made this change.  He is a very attentive and caring doctor.  He always sits and talks with me about my issues, discusses a plan of treatment and has me scheduled within a few weeks for injections.  This practice has been a God send for me.  All the staff are friendly and efficient with my care.  Thank you for the great care I am receiving, I wish I had changed my care to Chronic Pain Relief years ago.

I needed paperwork filled out from them, and after two weeks of them saying that it was done, they sent it a week AFTER that with incorrect information! Dr.Hisham Khan is only worried about his money! He will say you need a procedure before even suggesting healing/fixing naturally. I felt pressured to get a big procedure rather than discussing all my options. 10/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!

Dr. Kikkeri is kind, compassionate, and knowledgeable with a great sense of humor. He takes the time to explain to you his treatment plan. I never feel rushed.  From his friendly receptionists to his office manager Karen, you always feel welcomed. I've also seen Ms. Phillips and she is just as kind, compassionate and knowledgeable.

It was an absolute pleasure working with her. A true professional!|Advanced Pain Solutions has great staff and great Dr's. My doctor provides me with the best care that I need, and details every aspect of my care and what procedures are best for me.|As both a patient of Dr. Kikkeri and an employee at NTTC, I can attest to his exceptional care, knowledge, and skill. During my first pregnancy, I struggled with SI joint pain. An orthopedic surgeon recommended physical therapy, which helped alleviate the pain, but it never fully subsided.

During my second pregnancy, the SI joint pain became unbearable. Walking was excruciating, and I couldn't find comfort in sitting or lying down. Towards the end of my second pregnancy, I began working for Dr. Kikkeri. Postpartum, I resumed physical therapy, but this time with Dr. Paul. Dr. Paul is a kind and gentle soul, with great knowledge in physical therapy and rehab. His expertise significantly eased my SI joint pain.

As time went on and I juggled life with a toddler and a baby, I began experiencing severe lower back pain. Once again, Dr. Paul's physical therapy provided immense relief. However, when the pain persisted, I received a pain injection from Dr. Kikkeri, which gave me seven months of pain-free living. I was able to be an active mom, chasing my kids at the park and returning to yoga.

Dr. Kikkeri, Dr. Paul, Dr. Sandhu, and PA Trent have been incredible in educating me about my imaging and explaining everything in terms I can understand. Their compassion and expertise have been invaluable.

In fact, I had become very depressed and wasn't sure what to do.

Dr. Spjute was so kind and spent quite some time explaining things to me, and also told me about Spinal Ablation.  Now, the sound of it was something that might have put fear into me if I hadn't heard him out and also researched it.

It's been the best decision I've made for myself in many, many years. Dr. Spjute is both professional and kind and also possesses a great sense of humor. He treats his staff so well, and you can tell a lot about a person that way.

I feel like living again.  I think I have more issues to address where my health and spine are concerned,  and I guarantee that Dr. Spjute will be the doctor I will go to for help.

I cannot thank him and his staff enough for improving my life. I only regret not getting there sooner. Don't postpone your health or live in pain out of fear when there are answers and solutions that are life changing.  You're not too old and it's not too late to live a better life.

I've had my back pain for  2 years and have been to 3 different  pain management doctors, until I found Dr. Hynes.

I had the MILD procedure on my L4 and L5 yesterday (12-3-24) and woke up this morning  with my stabbing pain gone. Im sore from the procedure but my pain of 2 years is gone.

This was a minimal invasion procedure with no down time to speak of, I strongly recommend this procedure in lieu of full blown surgery of the spine.

When, I meet Dr. Hynes I knew I found the right doctor. His professionalism and knowledge of this procedure is stellar. He explained it and made it so clear on how and what I should expect. His bed side manners are unremarkable and something I needed since, I have been to so many others .

Greater Austin Pain Center staff were so polite and courteous as well with professionalism. Made me feel like it was the right choice and it was the case for me.

Good luck to all on your journey to get pain relief. I strongly recommend at the very least a visit to Greater Austin Pain Center. I really belief you will find it here.|Amazing experience wouldn't go any where else. Dr Hynes is great! He pays attention and doesn't judge. And for that am great full thank you.

Yahaira is the first person you meet & is the start of this incredible staff & Dr Moore's help.  She is always pleasant, very kind, understanding, informative and unbelievably helpful.  You will most certainly meet Kim and Irma too & they only continue the great experience, help & ensuring you get the schedule for injections & appointments that work for your availability not just theirs.  They treat you as if you were a good friend.

Dr Moore has truly helped me with my incredible pain & burning to where I can live my normal life. Dr Moore, Chris & staff have helped prevent two major surgeries that would guarantee future pain & surgeries for me.  He and his staff actually listens to you, understands your pain & actually help you.|Dr. Moore is one amazing Pain Management Physician.  I have been seeing him for over 7 years and I have been through more than the average Joe but he is very passionate about his patients and takes the time to hear what you have to say and He will go the extra mile to truly help you so long as your honest and forthcoming.  It is very hard to find any doctors that consider you anything other than a number and Dr. Moore is a very compassionate, caring  and dedicated man.  If you are looking for true Quality Care and  one on one care then you most definitely need to check out Dr. Robert Alan Moore.  He treats you like you are family and that is basically non existent in this day and time.  I have had Fusions, nerve ablutions and far more than my share of Spinal Stimulators  and this man is still working as hard  today as he did the first time I ever saw him after my lumbar fusion.  If you have a tough case then take it to Dr. Moore and he will go above and beyond to try and make your life better|I have been seeing Dr. Moore and his staff for a while now. He keeps amazing staff and  I couldn't be more happy with how my quality of life has improved with his treatments. They understand there is no cookie cutter treatment for everyone and they work hard to find what's right for you. He performed an SI Joint fusion which has drastically reduced my back pain. I also have received a neurostimulator implant in my neck post surgery pain which cured my chronic headaches and prevented another major surgery. Very happy! Thanks Dr Moore!|Dr. Moore and Chris are fantastic. I've felt with numerous pain management docs for about 15 years. These professionals are the best ever. They listen to what you hope for. They have never forced anything on me as others have. I will continue with Dr Moore and his staff until I draw my last breath. They respect that I have numerous issues and a terminal illness also. They have without question or doubt helped with not only the joint pain but consider the pain associated with my disease. I shudder at what shape I'd be in without them.
Thank you all for such wonderful and compassionate care.
Cheryl Hahn|I've been a patient here for nearly a decade and been very pleased with their care.

The physicians and staff have been nothing but kind & caring. I have now received a total of 3 spinal cord inplants that have allowed me to live a full life without need of the pain medications I was having to take and living in a mental fog.

I highly recommend the physicians and their staff to anyone in need of quality pain management.|It all starts with the front staff. They are professional yet very friendly and fun spirited. When you are dealing with pain, this is what you want in your office staff since they are the first office staff that you see.

Dr. Moore was very attentive and did not rush me out of his office on to the next patient charge that is so often common. He recommended a treatment for me that was based upon a good analysis. He recommended cold laser therapy.

I was very skeptical of cold laser. I committed to six treatments. To my surprise, I saw improvement in my deep muscle pain after the first treatment. Each treatment was progressively better. It did not completely eliminate the pain, but it made it tolerable so that physical therapy could become an option. This is the approach that I am taking. In short, it put the fire out and now it is up to me to strengthen the injured area.

Finally, no addictive medications were recommended to me!

Give it a shot.|Everyone has been very, pleasant and helpful. It's nice to see a staff that enjoys where they work, you can tell by their smiles.
I have been many places looking for relief from foot neuropathy and also nerve pain in my shin from a bad knee replacement.
After prescribing a non- addictive drug to help that pain Dr Moore suggested trying a laser procedure.
After six sessions, I had approximately sixty percent improvement in my feet. I decided to try it on my shins and am halfway through the process and am feeling relief in my shins also.

I highly recommend Dr Moore and his staff, you will be respected and well treated.|Dr Moore is fantastic! I dealt with severe chronic pain for 5 years until I was referred to him. He assessed me and implemented solutions that reduced my pain by 70% making a life changing difference in my outlook. The staff is professional and friendly. Always a great experience!

They have a very broad-based approach, using a combination of surgical injections, implanting stimulus devices, and medications. I have never met a doctor who listens as well as Dr Koning. Yes, he follows all rules, as will he should, but you can discuss your treatment with him and he will keep you completely informed about your treatment plan and the results that they expect.

The doctor listened and gave me several options. I've seen specialists and been in rehab centers for 24 + yearsand have come to realize that pain specialists and PTs are always patient, encouraging and upbeat! They want you to win as much you do. My only minus is that I'd called in to make sure the took my dual advantage insurance as was yes. I have pay the 20% before I can see him each. It will be a bit difficult and I really don't want to change doctors. It's scary, but I feel confident I will be able to see him. I really liked him and his staff. Great people! I'm sure he will get all 5 stars next time; this was just a little setback this!

Texas Intergrative Pain Institute is the ONLY choice for genuine, complete care.
Ebonni Green-Owens|This was supposed to be a 5 star review. My first appointment with the Texas Integrative Pain Institute was the first week of February. It went really well. Dr Warfield and all of his staff were amazing...kind, compassionate, caring and so very sweet. Dr Warfield gave me hope and he said the office would call me to set up some procedures. I left that appointment so excited about finding an excellent Dr and possibly finding some relief from the chronic pain I've had since 2016.  About a week later, the office called to tell me that Dr Warfield was working on getting my pain prescription going, as he'd never prescribed it before so they had to set it up in their system. That was totally fine as I still had a few weeks of my meds left to get me by.  Since then, I have called them on Feb 28, Mar 18, Mar 25, Mar 30 and Apr 9, all with no one answering the phone or returning my messages or calls. I've not been able to actually speak with anyone there since they called me about my prescription in Feb.  I have no idea what's going on. The last couple of messages I've left, I told them that I was still waiting for my procedure(s) to be scheduled, rationing my painkillers and I really needed someone, anyone, to call me back. I am also waiting to have gallbladder surgery and I can't schedule it until TIPI advises if they would prescribe my post-op medications or if the surgeon could. They haven't once called me since Feb. I'm on long term disability and my case manager sent a records request in Feb and Mar and she did confirm that someone at TIPI sent my records back to her on Mar 25 but for some unknown reason, they refuse to call me back!  I'm really worried that my LTD will now be cut off as they were waiting for me to get treatments with TIPI before determining if I could stay on it or if they were going to cut me off. I have no idea what to do. I am unable to drive to his office to see if there is anyone there and my husband can't take time off right now to take me. We just moved here from Oregon and it's just him and I. I'm so extremely disappointed. My first (and only) appointment went so well, I don't understand what's happening. Tomorrow I'll be forced to find a new pain Doctor in Houston, which I really don't want to do but I'm almost out of my meds and need treatment and I have no other choice at this point. I hope no one else has to go through this incredibly disappointing experience.|Very informative doctor.

To be clear, I am referring to a more recent situation. I just mentioned 2015 was the initial appointment. This last appointment situation occurred in the last year during the recent office changes...

My daughter was so disgusted with this place that she did not want to take the time to write a review, so I am writing one on her behalf.  She is an Air Force veteran who was initially a patient at this clinic in 2015.  In the last year, she needed to schedule an appointment to have her device replaced and these people gave her the runaround, not to mention, they were rude.  Every person she dealt with (office staff) was rude, obnoxious and uncaring.  It's sad that they treat people this way, especially veterans who have already been through so much.  This place should be shut down permanently.  I watched my daughter go through so much agitation while she dealt with these people. I told her she should definitely find a new doctor and she did.  In my opinion, this place is hot stinking trash and they do not deserve to have any patients under their care.  Hopefully, someone will see fit to shut them down.",2024-06-20|2023-08-28|2023-07-25|2023-06-08|2022-08-25|2022-07-19|2023-04-03|2022-01-11,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do they use methadone at all?","No, we do not offer that service",pain_management_services|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJi5llDfYuTIYRvvu7VUUpE6g,35

He is compassionate. Even gave me work to put the car charging system for his electric car in. The injections are working great. Plus the medication. He is a godsend. And I now consider him more a friend than a Doctor. The picture is Toby my dog. I couldn't even walk him 6 months ago. The staff is lovely. Thank you, Lord Jesus for Doctor Chapman and his office. In my opinion, he's the best. An experience.|Dr Chapman and his staff went above and beyond for my pain pump surgery. My surgery was an awesome experienced. My post op care was awesome too.

My initial visit with him was so surprising. He was very caring, detailed and took time to explain things to me. The injection procedure went very well too. Tri City has a very professional and caring staff and an exceptional facility. I'm happy to be their patient. I highly recommend Tri City Pain Associates, New Braunfels.|Was a bit nervous, never having been to a pain clinic before, but was quickly put at ease. Everyone was friendly and efficient. Dr. Chapman listened, asked questions, and explained options very well and unhurriedly. I did not feel rushed and was included in decision-making process. I left knowing that a definite plan for my needs was in progress and could change if, or as, needed. I feel very comfortable in returning and continuing treatment there.|Everyone at the New Braunfels office is very kind and friendly.

Every single interaction has been a headache.  The only reason for the two positive stars is that the providers are helpful, caring and work to find sustainable solutions for patients.|The dr is AWESOME... but his front office staff are very discourteous!!! I had called the office to verify our appointment times because my husband and I were both going and I wanted to make sure that I didn't have it wrong. The person on the phone told me that our appointments were at 11:30. I even asked about my husband as well and they said yes. We drove an hour and a half to the doctor and arrived at our appointments by 11:27 and when we walked through the door; the dark haired staff member looked up and simply said, ""Name?""... no greeting or anything!   I said our names and she rudely said, his appt was at 11:15 ... I immediately said, "" I called and verified that they were both at 11:30 because I was confused about the times...""... Her response was,"" That must've been the main office..."" And I said, so you won't see him?"" and she rudely said, ""No!""
First of all, who cares if it was the main office or not!   I called!  there should've been some kind of polite response from her. Such as, ""I am so sorry that that happened, but we can't see him today."" I would've been upset, but not as upset as I was with her rudeness and condescending attitude towards me!"" So, I asked her why when we weren't even 15 minutes late and it wasn't my fault they confirmed it wrong!  She just stood up and walked away.  So I leaned in and asked the other lady are you guys gonna see him today and she rudely looked at me and said, "" I'm with a patient"" ... I apologized and stepped back.  I wasn't sure what was happening since the other lady had just walked away.
About 3 minutes later the dark haired lady came back to the window and just blurted out, ""Driver's license and insurance card!""... so I looked at her and I said, ""are you gonna see my husband today?"" and she bluntly and with a rude smirk said, ""No!""  So, I said. ""I'm not seeing the Dr if my husband can't!""  We left.
We will be getting a new pain dr!  When you're in the kind of pain that we are in you expect to have some kind of courteous, caring staff, and it's really frustrating to be treated like that!
It's also sad because we really loved the doctor!|The scheduling/front deck staff that work at the keler location are the worst. From the time you walk in they are rude, can't make eye contact and overall just seem like they hate their lives. The only thing that keeps me coming back is my actual doctor. I've already tried to be seen at another location but can't due to my insurance.|Due to the extreme adverse reactions to chemo and radiation, my body has been put through the ringer and I have had 110 surgeries or procedures since 2008. Thank goodness this Dr.'s office doesn't treat me like a drug seeker, as I am not, I am just in constant pain due to the erosion of the bones and all the scar tissue I have all over my body.  They show and give excellent care and empathy!|My first appointment was great. Dr. Bahtla is awesome.  We agreed to start injections with anesthesia. Two days later I decided I didn't want the anesthesia.  I called the office to cancel that part of the procedure. I was assured my procedure date remained the same otherwise and was told the facility would call with a time to arrive. When that didn't happen I called them and was informed my appt. Was canceled. I did not cancel the procedure. I've been trying to call for a week (for another reason) and can not get anyone to answer. I left Messages, including to office mgr, to no avail. I've waited at least 3 weeks for this procedure and now this. Complete incompetence|Worst experience ever. They told me my urinalysis showed a high amount of heroin in my system. I have never done illegal drugs in my life. They refused to show me the results and cut me off my meds immediately. I went through withdrawals for a while. This all happened after I canceled a procedure they wanted me to have. I spoke with my surgeon and he said that procedure would not help me at all. Now I am blacklisted from ever getting pain meds again, I have osteoarthritis and multiple spinal surgeries. These people are terrible. I went for a hair follicle drug test through Quest Diagnostics the week after and it came back clean.|We would gladly give 5 stars for all the staff except the gal who greeted us.  We left the house 1 hr before our appointment, got stuck in traffic, but made it 12 mins before our 10AM scheduled time.  Our greeting was ""I was just fixing to cancel you for being late"".  I said ""We made it thru traffic and are only 3 mins late"" (for the last minute 9:45 change).  She snared back ""you are 6 mins late"".  I was on the verge of tears and offered to leave, but was told she would 'try to fit me in'.
The waiting room was empty, we were called back to the exam room immediately and waited nearly 30 minutes.  For someone working with patients in pain, she is not very welcoming, caring, or compassionate.  She is the only one who made our visit less than a 5 star experience.|Neerav J. Bhatla, MD is amazing! Very very intelligent and great bedside manner. He is treating my condition with the upmost care. Thankful is not even enough to describe how appreciative I am to have found Dr. Neerav J. Bhatla, MD
My pain was excruciating, I didn't know what to do. Now I have peace of mind, pain under control and able to heal fully

Dr. Vattam is an amazing and understanding doctor. He went through her records and although she takes a lot of medicines in order to function daily Dr. Vattam agreed she was responsible with her meds and treated her well.
Unfortunately, he then turned her over to the Nurse Practioner whi from day one with my wife had an attitude like every person coming through the door is drug seeking. She cut her pain meds back from 3 to 2 7.5 mg hydrocodone which did nothing for her pain. Her plan was to cut them out again because my wife also takes xanax. She's taken both for years. She doesn't mistake them. She's very aware of what could happen if taken together or close together. This woman thinks she's God and plays with peoples lives and pain by taking the meds away when she wants not because it's a necessity. They push procedures down the patients throats. There's a reason Europe refuses to do all this injections. They DONT help 99% of the patients. My wife has 13 diagnoses all that cause brutal pain at times and this nurse practioner released her. Gave her one refill and out the door she went. Its been a month and half. She's now on a walker or wheelchair thanks to no help from them. No pain medication and no hopes. Please don't waste your time if you should need pain meds as they will give you minimal and want to constantly do injections that don't help.

Dr Ali's staff has been consistently kind, courteous, & efficient for the past 4 years of my care. Dr Ali's exquisite integrity, expertise,  competency, professionalism, & dedication to his patients remain unparalleled. I recommend Dr. Ali without question to family, friends, & colleagues.|I have been very impressed with Dr. Ali and his staff.  Dr. Ali is very caring and a good listener.  He has been extremely patient with all my questions.  I have felt valued as a patient and not just a number.  Also, his staff has been very helpful when I have called the office with questions.  They are very responsive and call back, if they say they will.  In my opinion, the attitude in his office reflects good leadership.  I have been pleased with the results of my procedures and was informed what to expect beforehand.  Initially, I had two rounds of 6 shots (3 on each side) in my lower back that he was certain would not be effective (in my situation) long term.  The shots were a 1st step required by insurance before having an ablation.   (The first 2 or 3 days after the shots were great, but it didn't last.)  I had the shots without anesthesia, and it wasn't bad.  I liken it to getting a shot in your mouth by a dentist.  There's an initial discomfort but then everything goes numb.  You might feel a little prick during the quick procedure, but I was glad I didn't have anesthesia.  Next came the ablation on both sides of my lumbar spine.  For those two procedures I did have anesthesia.  I was chicken to have an ablation without it and was told it was a good decision.  The anesthesia wore off very quickly following the procedure, but you have to fast 8 hours before so one must forego morning coffee! I was totally fine the rest of the day.  Overall, I would say my back pain is 75% better and I only take a muscle relaxer occasionally if I need to.  Life is much better!  I'm very thankful for this relief because my lower back is not bad enough to warrant surgery at the present time.  From my experiences, I highly recommend Dr. Ali for his pain management expertise!

You are included in decisions and choices as to what has worked for you and what's best medically for you. He looks at all surgeries and injuries causing ongoing pain.

He told me I've had a lot of nerves affected with the many surgeries, injuries and chemo I've had then said - but we can make it better. Increased nerve pain I've been taking for several years. Took care of the intense pain with an injection on Christmas Eve that got me through two back to back services that were my responsibility in the things I needed to do. Could
not have endured without the injections for pain. Thankful beyond words for that. Then had another minor surgical procedure December 31st on lumbar spine after he'd asked which was worse lumbar or cervical spine pain. Lumbar first then and deal with cervical spine after that. The lumbar minor surgery December 31 made the 11 day cruise he knew I was taking in January much much better with more pain relief than it definitely would have been. He is dedicated to helping and I cannot say enough about his caring and understanding people who have severe pain. His staff is excellent as well. Professional and caring.

Always is eager to work out a treatment plan that is best for you.|Dr G. Atallah is a fantastic physician! I statred treatment in Los Angeles for severe back pain ad in a month the procedure failed to take. Dr. Atallah reviewed my MRI from LA as well as my records, we spoke, and he created a focused treatment plan. 3 months later, I am still going strong with a 80-95% reduction in overall pain. Yes, the next day after doing yard work sucks but medication gets me through easily and I am back to my new normal in a day or two.  In top of that is the only physician I've met that can actually operate his own computer system, scheduling, everything. He knows his business inside and out, his staff is beyond amazing and the perfect extension of the doctor. Each are knowledgeable, competent and friendly.This office is the gold standard all private practices should be held to and learn from.|I am extremely satisfied with Doctor Attalah and his staff. They are extremely attentive to my needs and help to properly manage my pain while I wait for my 5th procedure/surgery. I would recommend Dr Atallah to anyone who respects professionalism and understanding in a world that shuns those who are in constant pain.|I would not recommend this clinic to anyone.  While I have never met the doctors, the office team that they employ are horrible!!!  They don't answer the phone, nor do they return calls timely.  I have called on previous occasions several times to set up an appointment.  Each time, it was someone's voicemail by the name of Alexis.  She doesn't return calls timely as her voicemail states.  So my doctors office reached out to them to set up an appointment that should have already been done, now Alexis gives me a call back and seems very unprofessional on the call as she sets up my appointment, as well as rushing the call. So I called their office to let them know that I needed to reschedule, due to the fact that everyone in my home is sick with the flu, and I may have it as well.   Let's just say that I never had a chance to tell them that, because the unprofessional young lady left me on hold, and never came back to the line.  Nor did anyone answer the phone after I continued to call back over several times!!!  I will say this, no physician that I has ever cared for me, nor his team has ever displayed such incompetence as these people!!!  Nor any referrals!!!  This is absolutely sad in the Healthcare system!!  Now this leads me to question the integrity of my NP that referred me to this so called office!!!  I'll be giving her a call ASAP!!  I don't appreciate the lack of transparency and foolishness when it comes to my health and well-being.  So again, I don't recommend this clinic, and I advise you to seek a clinic that has real doctors and a medical team that actually cares about the patients.  Also, real receptionist that truly knows their job!!!|I visited this office about 6 months ago. The doctor was nice but office staff not friendly. I wanted to see the doctor again. My insurance changed so I gave my new insurance information to the person that made the appointment. She indicated that the doctor was in the network and accepted my insurance. Wasn't told about needing urine sample nor completing the forms which could have been emailed to me to save time in the facility. After over one hour then I was told about my copay higher after checking with the insurance company.
I asked to talk to the doctor. Both the front office staff which was unfriendly and the office manager didn't allow me to talk to the doctor saying that I had to stay all day in order to talk to him. They need to change the office staff including the manager to make it more patient friendly. They have this hazed glass window that you can't see the office staff. You have to keep knocking on the window to get their attention. What a shame. I left called the office and the office manager was even more rude and unfriendly. She indicated that it tskes long time to check with the insurance at the time to make the appointment like my time is less valuable. Stay away unless they change the office staff and manager.|I have suffered from lower back pain radiating down my leg for months. After an eval and injection from Dr.Atallah I have no pain.

Experienced alot of issues post covid and wish I would have found them sooner. Came from out of town for the sgb injections and have been the best thing I've ever done for my health and totally worth the money spent.|After losing my sense of smell and taste for three years due to COVID, I tried a ganglion block in New Jersey last year, but it didn't work for me. Then, I traveled to Texas to receive treatment at David Gaskin's clinic, and I was absolutely amazed by the results. In just 20 minutes, I regained about 60% of my taste and 20% of my smell. The improvement was incredible, and I'm beyond thrilled with the outcome. David Gaskin and his team were incredibly professional and welcoming. I highly recommend them --it's truly worth the visit! Now a month later, results are still the same, I am thrilled! May even go back for another visit!|I flew in from Canada to get treatment for Parosmia and I am so happy I did!!! Anyone who has done research on Parosmia knows this is the spot to get cured. They have an 85-90% success rate and have treated over 3500 people with Parosmia from as far as South Africa! The staff are lovely and super friendly. David takes the time to discuss everything with you, you aren't rushed at all and it's very clear he cares about his patients. At this time each shot is $500 USD. You have one shot scheduled in the morning and then you go try eat and smell all the things that you haven't been able to eat for months/years. If it's not 100% better you can go back for the second shot. I was about 75% improved after the first and 95% after the second. I am so happy I came. The money is so worth it to get your life back.|Highly recommend David Gaskin and his team for SGB/Parosmia treatment. David truly cares about the patient and it shows tremendously when you talk to him. He takes time to explain everything, educate, answer questions, and give expectations. (Crystal was fantastic too!). I love that he is big on educating others, doing peer studies, consulting with other medical teams and researching constantly. David gives detailed instructions on things to do at home to help overall wellbeing/health in conjunction to his in office treatment. We live in a world that is filled with doctors that are quick to simply write a prescription and send you on your way, and its staggering. So to have someone take your issues seriously and get to the root cause of the problem, while showing concern and wanting to help you improve really says something. I saw David for bilateral SGB to treat Parosmia from Covid nearly 3 years ago. I had both sides treated about a week apart. 2nd injection was definitely my dominant side, as I had a significant amount of resolution quickly after this side was done (30 minutes after). I could smell the freshly cut grass as left the office; peanut butter, coffee and Oreos taste as they should! Now I'm adjusting to the new and old smells/tastes that I've lived without for so long. I'm not sure what percentage I have back but it's high and makes life better for so many reasons. If you're on the fence, go for it! You won't regret it.|I came from Canada to the clinic for treatment for parosmia. David and his staff are the best and take the time to really explain the condition and treatment.  Everything about the experience was positive and I have a good outlook now for my condition. I highly recommend them.|I went in to talk about finding help for my neuropathy of my feet. As you can see in other posts that all they want to sell is a nerve block. Mr. Gaskin took offense to me questioning the effectiveness of this treatment for neuropathy of the feet. He cussed numerous times during some of our conversation ( using the F word during a consultation is not professional at all ) . All they want to do is give you a shot  ( may work for some, but very little to no research on neuropathy ) . No shot in the neck for me at five hundred a pop.|Dr Gaskin took the time to explain everything and has the best bedside manner of any doctor I've been to, and I've been to a lot! After suffering from autoimmune symptoms and parosmia for 3 years, I've finally found some relief. Great experience!|Dr. Dunlap is wonderful, he helped me with my pain issues, he made me feel very important, he looked me in the eye and explained everything he was going to do to help with my pain problems.
The nurses were also wonderful, Jessica was with me and caught me just before I fell, JR was very friendly and helpful. The lady at the front desk was super helpful and was very friendly, the other two ladies at the front were also very friendly and all three smiled a lot and I love that so much.

The doctor and office staff used to be amazing, but now they seem like they don't care & you're just another number. When there are issues, like a pharmacy not receiving a prescription, it is extremely time consuming and frustrating to get things fixed. You can call and leave messages & if you are lucky, just maybe that office will call you back, maybe. The doctor used to talk to you and listen to what is going on in your life and sometimes even make good connections to how things could be connected, but now it seems like they just don't have time for you & in my opinion, in talking to the office staff, it feels like they couldn't care less.

Of all the doctors I've seen over the years, this is the only one that consistently seems to have issues with their electronic prescription system. It's about 50/50 if the pharmacy will receive the new prescription & if there is some issue, forget about it, because they only submit scripts at the end of the day & even if there are issues, don't expect them to actually call the pharmacy and confirm receipt.  When things get messed up, don't expect any help, empathy or concern, but if you leave a message out of frustration and in pain, DO EXPECT to get a call and to be read the riot act & threatened by the withholding of medical care by the office manager, not the doctor. This place used to be a good place for healing, but something has drastically changed & now it's more like visiting the DMV than a care provider.|Dr Garjaj is an egoistic who is more interested in quantity and not quality. He is extremely unprofessional and yells at his patients. And don't be surprised if you get a bill long after seeing him for treatment you never received. The practice is chaotic and confusing and when you arrive for treatment you must pay or not be seen no matter your condition and pain. The dollar is the only motivation for this practice. Please don't trust him.|Dr. Gajraj has been able to pinpoint my source of pain and it is under control at this point. I also have had several appointments with his PA, Sarah Levy, and she has also been very helpful. She listens well and makes very good suggestions. She is obviously very sensitive to patient problems. With all this I can highly recommend the North Texas Center for Pain Management.|I love Dr. Gajraj and his staff! I am coming off an ACL tear in my right knee and they have taken such good care of me. I absolutely adore his 2 nurse practitioners (whom I meet with each time I go) and they are the sweetest, most caring people I've ever met. Always offering suggestions, asking about my newborn son (he's 1), and always making me feel warm and welcome. I've never been happier!|I drive a long distance to see Dr. Gajraj and his office has always been very accommodating.  I suffer from chronic pain due to Systemic Lupus.  After 2 long years of dealing with many awful doctors, I was referred to Dr. Gajraj from another physician.  I've been seeing him well over a year and my quality of life has improved dramatically. I've found that many pain docs take advantage of the patients needy position with degrading behavior that one's expected to just tolerate. This physician is always very respectful, professional and extremely knowledgeable.  I've never felt uncomfortable or judged. If there is one thing I know it's Doctors...this one is a great one!|I can't say enough great things about Dr. Gajraj! I had terrible pain in one of my back muscles for weeks. I tried everything to make it better and it just kept getting worse until a friend recommended Dr. Gajraj. I didn't know pain management doctors even existed! Dr. Gajraj got me in the very next morning and was so kind and knew exactly what I needed. He even called the next day to check on my progress. He fit me in every 3 days for 10 days and I'm so happy he got me back to normal. If you have pain go see Dr. Gajraj!! You'll be so happy you did!|I'm a newer patient of Dr. Gajraj but have been dealing with chronic pain for over a decade.  I have been to many doctors and have experienced many procedures and surgeries, so I feel like I have a good idea of different doctor offices, what works and what doesn't.  I'm so glad to have found Dr. Gajraj.  He is so knowledgable about pain and what things can be done for your pain.  He takes the time to listen and isn't trying to rush you along which is very important to me.  We have tried some new things for my pain and he has some other ideas to try. I am very hopeful that in the near future, my pain will be in a holding state instead of constantly increasing.  His office staff is very nice and personable and helpful.  I also trust that Dr. Gajraj is recommending procedures that he feels confident that could work and not just because he wants to have monetary gain.  He has been very truthful with me, and I appreciate that more than my words can express.|I've been a patient of Dr. Noor Gajraj at the North Texas Center for Pain Management for approximately 3 years, and cannot be more pleased with my treatment and the progress I've made since I've been under his care. Not only are Dr. Gajraj's medical credentials impeccable, but so are his bed side manners.  He is truly caring, attentive and compassionate. He goes out of his way to create a plan of action that is within reach physically and financially, especially important to me as I have no health insurance. His office is conveniently located on the first floor of a free standing building to you don't have to mess with hospital or garage parking.

Something is definitely off in the axillary help department. They want to be able to conduct themselves any way they choose, but you'd better not complain. They can be as slow as they want, or hours late. If you do it, you will be charged. An office visit can start over an hour late your choice is to take it or leave it. A 30min visit can extend well beyond 2 hrs. You're exorcist to wait with NO update. My mother loves her Dr. Zidan, her NP, and Mrs. Laws. They are the only reason we still come. She won't change doctors.|Do not use this doctor's office. They harassed me repeatedly to show up 30-45 minutes early and then made me wait almost 2 hours (no exaggeration) to see the doctor. This is a very unprofessional business. I asked the nurse to let the doctor know that I was upset and she said he did not want to speak to me. What a piece of trash. Not man enough to come apologize for wasting my time. The office is also not well air conditioned. It was hot in the tiny, cramped waiting room. People were having to stand up.

I understand trying to find a different route but until we do I know this works.|The office staff is very friendly and helpful. dr Amar Vidan is an exceptional Dr. Very caring and his injections have illuminated pain in areas that I had severe pain for over 4-5 years I have seen 2 other pain drs that did not help me with my pain.

But the front desk staff can be very rude and unpleasant. It's basically impossible to reach someone in the Keller offices. My latest experience I had reschedule an appointment my understanding it was at 11:30. When I arrived @11:27 I was greeted with these words front desk -Your appointment was at 11:15 (Erin his PA ) not will NOT see you"" I explained there was a miscommunication about the time + did not received a text/call or email to confirm.
How my time is so limited and I couldn't come back another day.
She asked the PA and her response was- that's why we give out cards with time/date of appointment. She won't see you"".
I Had Made My follow up appointment via Phone call. Not in Office there was no card with time!
I had to leave, my Reumatologist referred me to another pain & spine specialist.|Where do I start? I have nothing but positive feedback about this location. I had to call last week to make an appointment and spoke with a Janaija ( hopefully I spelled it correctly) lol and she was amazing. She answered all my questions and was very kind even when I didn't understand. Thanks for the great customer service.|Dr. Mitchell is a well educated doctor. He attentively listens to your concerns, reads over all notes from your other doctors and comes up with a plan that fits your needs. Whether it be medication, injections or recommending surgery he's there for you. Also, his staff is reflection of his leadership. I highly recommend Dr. Mitchell @ Pain Management Institute.|Easy scheduling, little wait time, overall a good experience.

Edit for update: All I'm going to say is this- I've been in excruciating pain since 2001, but refused to even consider back surgery. No pain meds, just a high tolerance for pain and a progressively souring attitude. Injection? Sure thing. Another one, but maybe 3. Uh, ok. But then when the actual PAIN MANAGEMENT PHYSICIAN dismissed my very valid question as irrelevant, proceeded to degrade my PCP for her choice of muscle relaxer, that's it. She didn't pick it, I did. Because in 20 years, there haven't been enormous medical breakthroughs in that particular area. Once again, someone who's actual JOB TITLE is Pain Management/ Anesthesiologist, has clearly stayed far past her expiration date on compassion. When your PCP says ""Wait, aren't you seeing a pain management doctor? She's not managing much."" I should've pulled the e brake immediately. Instead I foolishly trusted it was just a bad day, I'm super anxious so etc etc. No, it is not me. And I get it's really a sh1t job where you're lied to all day. Everyone knows that. It's not my fault that the rubber glove treatment finally got to physicians. But if you can't get past your own indignation to effectively treat the patients you see? It's time.|They never answer their phone3 to reschedule appointments, they DON""T return any messages. Been trying for 2 weeks now and left several messages. Nothing don't recommend them for anything|My Mother & I one of Her caregivers made a hour trip to her appointment to get her pain medication refills.  I ask the assistant and the nurse to make sure Her medications were sent to CVs  "" if they had my Mom's medications in stock, and shocking, they didn't even receive the orders from Dr Mitchell.  Will you please remedy  that mistake.  Also,  when we came in for the appointment, last month, which I was there, it as well was not entered into your office and was told She didn't have an appointment, until my Mom showed proof with Her card.  My Mom's shoulders are hanging on by a sliver ( both), & she has to scoot 5 steps max at a time, as Her knees are so bad at 82, with a walker moving slower and than a snail from pain.  Please stop applying the torture.  She is a beautiful person inside and out and our family wants to knows you care enough to remedy the problem, as it's the weekend and it takes pain medication to help her make it to church to help teach Sunday School, which is the 1 thing She loves doing and can barely do it, but does for Jesus.

I didn't want to write this review but I got sick and tired of the waiting time. No professionalism at all. JPS and Parkland do better than this.|Been ill for over 2 decades. I have trigemina neuralgia, occipital neuralgia and autonomic neuropathy. In the past 24 years I have seen over 100 specialists throughout the U.S. For the past 19 years I was seeing a Pain Dr. in San Antonio. She is 1st class, honest and brilliant. But the trip became too difficult for me painwise  ... travel, hotel, etc. too expensive.

I was referred to Dr. Phan locally. I had a patient for 8 months or so. He prescribed morphine tablets ... as well as a few other meds which were $600 to $700 per month! Couldn't afford! This happened over and over ... like he was trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat.

After a few months his asst. said I had failed a urine test, actually 2. But they waited until my next appt. to tell me. Dr. Phan was too scared to tell me, saying 'it's ok from the hallway after his asst. condemned my HABIT. But his assistant was adamant that the test results were 100% correct. She said I was using HEROIN or Oxycontin. I told them it was impossible. Never used heroin, not ever and wouldn't. And it had been over a decade since I had used Oxy!

On the 3rd test I failed again ... but after waiting for an hour in the waiting room
the office attendant took my copay, and in the waiting room she told me I had failed AGAIN in front of all those in the waiting room! Of course, I wanted to talk to someone ... Dr., asst or in-house LAB?
No way! No one would talk to me. Finally, I was refunded my copay.

I showed the test results to other doctors and they LAUGHED and were dismayed ... after looking at the test results. For years I had been using Fioricet w codeine which 'Peter Phan' knew. Adding morphine to the mix caused a reaction that created a false positive? I even tried to explain this on the 2nd fail ... but was scorned as a druggie and one using heroin or Oxy! I had read about these interactions from years past. But they wouldn't hear it!

Finally, during this MESS I had begun falling and gasping for air. Phan sent me to a heart Dr. Thousands $$ in tests! Heart Dr. sent me to pulmonologist, thousand$ again in scans and tests! Finally, the drug test fiasco proved to be an eye opener! A blessing! All this time ... It had been the MORPHINE which had constricted my LUNGS! After failed tests I had no more morphine ... so I went cold turkey over a few days, and began BREATHING again! And this pain clinic never ever mentioned this! They should never be in business!

I've been encouraged to sue but I'm not the suing type. If you read this please rethink going to this place. If I could have rated this place a ZERO I would have! Good luck?|The first pain management specialist I had was so bad Jeremy Epstein don't go to him he had me scared to visit this pain specialist.

They took my name, number and insurance information to verify benefits.

Got a call back stating they are not accepting new patients. Why didn't someone tell me that when I called?

Got a call a few days later to make an appointment. Receptionist took all my information and confirmed an appointment date.

Get a call the next day ""there was a miscommunication, we are not accepting new patients. The appointment you had needs to be cancelled"" - not very professional.

Yes, I was a potential new patient. As a manager in customer service, the back and forth was unnecessary and clearly a sign of how the practice is run. Definitely dodged a bullet.|They let me go from the office after their mess up. The office manager was VERY unprofessional! So sad to have seen Dr Chen go. Don't waste your money on this place! The manager is quite the joke and has no respect. You would think he is on the patients side but nope. Beware of him only caring about money. Steer clear of here!|I cannot explain enough in words what The Pain Relief Center in Plano, Texas has meant to me in the last 14 days. Dr. Chen has the best personality, experience, and knowledge of any Dr. I have ever met. He listens and explains the issue and plan in a way that I have never experienced before. I moved to Texas a year ago and recently had an issue with back pain that was very debilitating. Dr Chen was quick to diagnose, and get me in for an injection and immediately control my pain. He surrounds himself with an impeccable staff, Jennifer, April, Randy, and Nancy and so many more I have not met. I am sure Dr. Rodriguez is absolutely the same way! They care about you, listen, want you to get better and never judge. If you have pain and want a place that is not only state of the art, but REALLY CARES about you! I implore you to choose The Pain Relief Center in Plano, Texas. Words cannot thank them enough and I will be a patient here as long as I need to be! I would experience on your own! You will NOT be disappointed.|Dr. Rodriguez, Debbie and staff are amazing. They have changed my life! I am able to enjoy life and thrive due to the Pain Relief center! Their treatment plans are effective and they always explain everything to ease my mind. The staff is super friendly and there is just such a positive vibe within the office. I highly reccomend them.|WOW is the only thing I can say! I've been dealing with back pain for 10+years and I've seen a few different doctors and pain mngmt and all I can say is Dr Rodriguez cares and listens and helps. In my 30 min visit he did more for me then any other doctor I've ever seen! Lab work DONE, knee&back brace DONE, range of motion test DONE, relief DONE!!!! I almost cried in happy relief! His staff from from office to back office was sweet and compassionate and genuinely ready to listen and help in any way. They took care of EVERYTHING for me. If you have chronic pain/injury you will not be disappointed with this office/nurses/Doctor.
Dr Rodriguez ISN'T the kind of Doctor to throw medication your way, he's willing to get to the root of your pain. Hands down the BEST doctors visit I've EVER had. I can't say enough about my visit in terms of how fabulous it went. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this Doctor and office. If you want quality care, if you want a Doctor who going to listen and care, if you want a Doctor's office who's staff is A+, then please call them. They'll help you!|I met with Dr. Chen today and he spent at least 25 minutes diagnosing my issues. He was confident he could get me back to normal. It has been 25 days since my injury with little to no relief, but seeing Dr. Chen gave me hope that I can get my life back. He is compassionate, caring and listens which in his field is basically unheard of. The entire place is A+ status. I checked in the girls at the front desk were amazing, the girls that took my paper work and had me do the UA were unbelievably and it wasn't an act. I could hear Dr. Chen corresponding with the staff before my visit and it was genuine interaction. I called the nurse line with a question and they were 100% prompt and amazing as well. I moved from MN and took the first pain clinic I saw. I did not do research. I did this time on this move and it paid off. I was with 1 doctor for 15+ years and trust in your Dr. and trust in the patient are important. This is the last place I will ever go for back pain. If I could give them 10 stars I would. I know I will get my life back! That is a great feeling.

7/16/20- The staff from Randy at the front desk to April and Jennifer on the Nurse line are first rate caring people that make every effort to help! Dr. Chen by far the best Dr. I have ever dealt with, caring best personality and Cares about what you have to say! I will Never go anywhere else!

I have been to this office twice.

Let me preface this by saying, I live about 40 minutes away. There are plenty of pain clinics closer.

The first time I met Dr Golden and her Nurse Assistant (I have completely forgotten her name, I'm sorry), I knew I was in the right spot. They are compassionate, caring, understanding and most of all, I don't feel judged. I am not an easy medical case. Anyone with chronic pain knows what I mean.

I recently had an issue with one of my prescriptions. The Office Manager, Sue took care of it immediately and then called me back to let me know. Customer service is exceptional when the Manager actually calls you back to let you know something has been handled.

Thank you Dr. Golden and your Staff for showing empathy and true genuine kindness.|My experience on this first visit was great!  The staff is wonderful!  NP Onuwali is knowledgeable, professional, compassionate, and caring. I cannot say enough about the amazing staff. I have hope now!|Met with Dr. Alex Golden (she) yesterday.   A little chaotic as the team had just moved into the new office space, not sure if it was 100% of the team, but Dr. Golden was there.   Nice space.

Team very friendly and courteous as I watched the patient interaction (even one guy that asked the same questioni 3x, always a friendly response).

Met with Dr. Golden, found her to be patient, open to questions and fully explaining things.  She has recommended a course of action for treatment that I will follow.|Rude staff, rude doctors.

RUN! GO ANYPLACE BUT HERE!

The staff and doctors are awful! They don't explain things and constantly say one thing and do another and then blame you.

Even after I canceled my appointment and told them they were fired, they called and left another rude message.

Also, WARNING, if you have a procedure with them that involves a groin area shot, they take you into a hospital type setting and then tell you to get on a table and drop your pants. No hospital gown or anything. Very unprofessional and honestly it didn't feel right at all! I now have another complaint to put in to the medical board on them!|Was seen Monday for severe sciatic pain limiting my ability to walk and was scheduled for epidural injections the following Monday. Was called on Wednesday because they needed me to reschedule to a later time on the same day. Ok fine. Was called by an after-hours answering service again Friday at 6pm and told my upcoming appointment for Monday was cancelled. Thanks for wasting my time. I could have found another doctor instead of dealing with this injury for a week waiting for nothing. Absolute garbage. Look elsewhere for help!!|Arrived at designated time for an appointment to see a staff member sitting on the floor outside the office. Google shows the office opens at 8am and the appointment was at 830am. The young lady seemed very passive & nonchalant about office possibly opening at 9am but didn't seem to care much about us.

This probably showcases how they run their business and practice so we left.|Got here at 1:15 it is now 2:23. Looks like it's going to take another 30 to get me checked out. Never rush for this pain doctor. They are always slow on leaving|Awful place. Office manager Enrique treats you like trash and expects you to do his job for him and won't give answers as to why they hide things from you. I was told on the phone I would see doctor Howard (individually a wonderful doctor) but I was passed off to a PA, not even an MD. I specifically moved from the Greenville location because they too were horrible, but this place is also. Can't say enough bad things. Oh, and they don't return phone calls and good luck getting ahold of the actual offices.

Was told one price over the phone, then they raised it by OVER 25% once I got there! I don't see how they think it's okay to make such a change, especially when your patients are paying out of pocket.

Original Review: Dr Basava was the answer to my finding a treatment plan for my long term pain! Can't thank her enough.|Worse paint management Dr ever. Doesn't care about their patients takes 200 everything I need a prescription filled plus prescription. Telling me the are refillingn my prescription everything. The young man that answers the phone says he put in a request and that I will have it today. This is now the second time with them.  All u have to do is call the pharmacy. All they do is steal your money and do not help the people. Beware of this place! Do not trust Dr. Basava|Dr. Basava is an amazing doctor. She was able to calm me down before my procedure.

It never failed until TPC tries to send in a prescription. I'm leaving this practice because I have had a hemorrhagic stroke and they don't respect my fear that going without my medicine can cause. My BP instantly rises and I get a severe headache. To have any serious headache causes anxiety.  I'm gone.|Today I came to this Dr. Office and received the worst service ever. The young ladies at the front desk were very rude I wasn't able to be serviced and I honestly had to remove myself because I didn't for see myself dealing with such terrible customer service. My mother is the one that referred me to this office however I do not feel I would come back because of the treatment I received from the time I walked in the door. I'm a firm believer of receiving customer service and I also know that once you walk into a doctors office of all places there should always be friendly faces and personalities because you're the first impression.

The entire staff seem to genuinely enjoy their work and have been very cordial and yet professional during my in person appointments, as well as my follow-up phone calls.  They are extremely responsive and accommodating when I've had questions or concerns.

Just one example, I kept a log of my post-injection symptoms and called the office today to see if there was any way I could get that info to Dr. Khan and not wait for my virtual follow-up appointment scheduled for next week.  Jennifer gladly provided me with an email address I could send my info to.  She said she'd be sure to get it to Dr. Khan who was off site.  I received a callback from Jennifer 30 minutes later.  She told me Dr. Khan had reviewed my notes and agreed there was no reason to wait until next week.  They were able to squeeze me in for tomorrow to see Dr. Khan in person.

Dr. Khan's office called me again as soon as the next injections were approved by Insurance.  They were once again able to squeeze me in that same week.

I had a few questions for Dr. Khan before my next injections and he took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my questions.

I'm just expressing my experience so just don't even put in yours in my experience, thanks a bunches.

Make sure you get sedated if you have anxiety and please check your paperwork or ask deeper questions to make sure they are in the correct area you need treatment for.

Dubose does NOT care or concern himself about his patients. Office staff are unprofessional as well. Dubose, with a ream full of my VA medical records documenting all my injuries, told me he would NOT prescribe ANYTHING to  help me. Other patients have said he will just reduce their meds without warning or concern. He is in the business to make money, not help people and that reflects in his attitude towards his patients.|First off my wife loved Dr. DuBose and he was her favorite Dr. She had been under pain mgmt. for 5+ years in Ft Worth. Another Dr. recommended him and he was 25 miles closer for us. For 2 or more years it was great. No problems until one day at her monthly appt. He told her she failed her last drug test. We were floored. We never even gave drug test second thoughts because she was a stickler for following the rules. In 7+ years never a blip on her record. She is an RN and did everything right to make sure she never had a problem. She was prescribed and took morphine but the test supposedly said she had taken Tramadol recently and he said he was dismissing her. Tramadol would be like taking aspirin compared to the morphine , so it made no sense at all why she would take it. We racked our brains trying to think of where it could have been introduced to her. She takes many other meds and we googled what would give a false positive for Tramadol. Her anti depressant medicine was the first thing that popped up. We informed Dr. DuBose and he asked the lab , they said it wouldn't cause it. My wife had Dr D look it up , sure enough he pulled the same info up. Even after he saw the lab had seemingly lied to him he still didn't listen. She offered to take any test he wanted to give but he didn't offer. You wouldn't offer to take a test , if you knew you had taken something you shouldn't have either. We wanted to know and have peace of mind if she had inadvertently taken some somehow , so I ordered a 13 panel hair sample test that test a minimum of three months previous drug use. We completed the test and sent it in. When we got the results , NEGATIVE for Tramadol use. At least we knew for sure it wasn't a mistake on her part

Like I said , we like Dr.Dubose and his office very much. I don't know how it happened , maybe a bad test or bad chain of command getting it from the bathroom to the lab , but it happened. My wife was SO embarrassed , humiliated , and devastated knowing she had done everything to the letter right for 7+ years and then felt like she was getting the bums rush for something she didn't do. It makes it harder finding a new Dr. too when you have this on your record. It still bothers and humiliates her months later. We harbor no ill feelings for him or his office. I don't know what caused the false test but I feel like it could have been handled differently. Do you know how hard it is to prove you didn't do something ........ that you didn't do ??|Dr. Dan is great! Very empathetic with a great bedside manner. The staff of D3 Pain Management is consistently helpful and professional as well and friendly.|Dr DuBose was wonderful. I was worried about pain management as just pain drugs. Dr DuBose had a great plan with out drug.  I'm 62 and a retired firefighter.  I'm experiencing pain in my neck.  He had solution.

The practice lacks effective communication and professionalism. Brandon, the receptionist, was quite unhelpful. Brandon struggled with basic tasks such as scheduling appointments, had poor communication skills, and displayed concerning behavior. Instead of providing the practice's availability, he asked for mine.... This shows me that River City Pain Management lacks organization and has a poorly structured scheduling process.

I scheduled an appointment months in advance to simply pick up my cast and was told that my ankle cast would be ready. However, I took time off work AND drove 45 minutes to River City Pain Management. I was greeted with disorganized and unacceptable behavior. Rather than updating me beforehand that the cast was not going to be in my treatment plan, the staff unknowingly scrambled around and screamed out searching for the cast outside the exam room. This made me feel uncomfortable, awkward and frustrated knowing that there was no point of me going in the practice to pick up my non existent cast. A simple phone call to address the situation in advance would have been considerate.

After I told my lawyer about my experience and decided to not continue with the practice, Brandon called me multiple times back-to-back like a toxic person would. As I was not able to pick up, Brandon used a different number to reach me when he could have left a voicemail or text...highly unprofessional.

Additionally, despite deciding to discontinue treatment, I was sent medication without my knowledge, which increased my bill unnecessarily. This felt exploitative, and the lack of transparency was troubling.

While Dr. Arnold de Leon was helpful, the management and staff made my experience a complete waste of time and resources. I cannot recommend this practice to anyone. If I could give 0 stars, I would.|This place is awesome  Dr Hunter and the  staff Is super cool. I highly recommend this clinic . The girls in the back are very helpful and friendly and personable me and my son both had pain injections shots and Dr Hunter was superb and  anesthesiologist come here you won't regret it !!!|I Highly recommend Dr Hunter! I have been in severe neck pain with 4 herniated disc's in my neck since October 2023 causing pinched nerves in my back and neck and affecting my arm and hand, and he was so kind and patient and caring. The most kindest compassionate Dr I have ever seen. He recommended a cervical epidural steroid injection. I was scared to have it and had severe anxiety. His surgery nurse Mona talked me out of some of my fear of having the procedure yesterday. And Dr Hunter was so sweet and kind and understanding and except for a little sting at the injection site with the numbing medication I didn't feel anything other than a little pressure of the medicine going in. I worked myself up and my blood pressure up for no reason.|I have had several injections in my spine, knee, and hand. Dr. DeLeon is by far the best pain management Dr. in San Antonio. He is knowledgeable, effective, and compassionate. All of the staff are thorough, friendly and efficient.|I just wrote a review and the whole review disappeared!
So here goes another shot at telling everyone with pain issues, Go DIRECTLY TO DR. MICHAEL HUNTER!
I have been under his superb care and pain management supervision since DECEMBER 23, 2020!

I have told him and everyone I know that HE is the first and only doctor that has really listened to me and provided precisely the best care ever!

He and I have reached such a high level of trust, understanding  and he always knows exactly what my condition requires and treats me accordingly. Dr. Michael Hunter is exactly where he should be and doing what he needs to be doing. He is very humble and has the heart of a loving servant. I trust him and respect him like no other doctor I have EVER encountered in my entire life.

I know that some of this is sounding perhaps a bit gushy to some of you...but this is my honest opinion of him and it's all true.

I knew early on that because of his true empathy for his patients,  that he would become wildly popular at the clinic, and that is exactly what has taken place. His character and integrity are admirable to behold.

The staff, of course, all function like a well-oiled machine with no bottlenecks present to interrupt the flow of billing and record-keeping, etc. Although everything runs smoothly this way, the entire staff is made up with sincere, caring and respectful employees always ready to go that extra mile with a smile on their face.

When you are in serious pain, this is definitely the BEST PLACE for you to go. Just get there according to your appointed time, answer all the questions clearly and honestly-- then just let go and let God work through these exemplary health care providers.|My previous pain doctor retired after me seeing him for 20 years and by the grace of God I found Dr Hunter. He has referred me to 2 surgeons to see if i can be helped with surgery instead of the same old month after month pain meds like my other doctor did. Dr Hunter is very caring, he spends all of the time with me that I need and never rushes me out the door. He seems to honestly care about my pain and wants to do everything possible to help.
The staff is very good and hasn't let me slip  through the cracks. I highly recommend River City Pain Management!|Dr. Michael Hunter, MD is The Very Finest Pain Specialist. He truly cares deeply about the outcome and well-being of all his patients! Dr. Bryan Lai, MD works together with  Dr. Hunter. He is such a truly caring Dr and gives all his patients such amazing care. The team of Doctors all truly care about everyone. I've watched them help people who were suffering with much pain. Some didn't have prior authorization  but were suffering with pain. These Finest Doctors truly care and helped them right away. It touched my heart to see how they put the Patient First and helped them right away! God bless these Finest Caring Doctors at River City Pain Management. I thank God for blessing me with them.

She takes her time and gives you her undivided attention.|If there were a zero rating, that is the rating I would choose.  I would like to express my deep disappointment in the services received from Dr. Adepitan.  My disappointment stems from the fact that she was not responsive to calls and text messages when her guidance was mostly needed.  In times of enormous pain and discomfort and a desperate need to contact her, all I was given was an office number where only a recording was heard.  Messages were left but no response was made.  Additionally, once I received her personal cell phone number text messages with desperate pleas for help and guidance were not responded to.  Requests for how to wean myself from the prescription drugs prescribed, can I split a dose in half, what interaction drugs had with others, among some of the requests, were never answered.  I felt like there was no one monitoring the opiods that had been prescribed.  I do not recommend Dr. Adepitan to any patient needing pain management assistance.|My father had a car accident and had some pain with the mri showing problems with his spine.

Dr. Malik is very patient and is willing to work with you and he really listens to you. My pain in my knee is so much better!  I don't have to take pain killers on a regular basis - just a couple of Tylenol every now and then. I am so thankful!
Allison at the front desk is so welcoming and helpful. !!|Dr Malik is very professional, and he and his staff are very likeable also, which is always a plus. He diagnosed my pain, and we decided on a treatment plan that will allow me to continue my outdoor and other activities. A true blessing for which I am grateful.  Ya know, I just scrolled back through All of the reviews, as of now, 3-23-24, all are 5 star, ALL. ok??

Ok, now, 4-11-24, let me tell you that I got an epidural yesterday, and pain that has been effectively crippling me is gone or greatly relieved today, Dr Malik has cautioned me this may b a temporary effect, but this is miraculous...
And
Ok. So, the Epidurals were great,lasted a few months.
Thursday we completed a nerve ablation procedure, a facet block.
idk how long this will last, nerves can re generate, but if you have been living w lower back pain like I have, for 30> years, being as pain free as I am now is Miraculous. Typically this lasts 6 months- years and years maybe forever.
It's just, well it's enough to cause EXTREME GRATITUDE.
THANK YOU Ike, Allison,and my dear sister that introduced us.
You've been a God send to me lil bro.Today is 8-24-24, b.t.w., so from epidurals to facet blocks took approximately four months, you know, you have t try the least invasive first,as in anything,. I think that's really great, especially as I mentioned this has been over 30 years of living in constant pain.
I cannot gush over this enough, I have my mobility back, I have my ability to be more, much much more, active. Be a part of my children's and grandchildren s lives again...
Hugs all around guys. God bless us, everyone.

I'm very happy to have found him.|I played sports for many years into my adult life and suffered from severe knee pain as I got older. I wanted to avoid knee surgery as long as I could. Dr Malik had a different approach with physical therapy and  In-office procedures that made my pain more manageable. I have also recommended friends with shoulder and back pain, and they have received similar results. I highly recommend Dr Malik and his office for pain management and professional care.|The facility was so clean and beautiful.  Dr. Malik is very nice and professional.

I am always treated respectfully and enjoy the interaction with all the folks who work there as well as the Dripping Springs location.|So far I have only had an initial intake appointment but the office was great at getting me in ASAP to the location with the earliest availability with the understanding that future visits could be scheduled at one of their more convenient to me locations. They let me know the initial paperwork takes 45 minutes but after I was scheduled I was able to print and complete the paperwork from home so my wait time at the office was minimal. The front desk ladies were wonderful and supportive of each other (one gal was having her computer updated and the others made sure she could access what she needed until it was done). The medical assistant was patient, thorough and kind. The doctor was already well read on my situation (thank you PCP for sending a thoroughly written referral) and my visit was exactly what I expected. I know my plan of care and what to expect moving forward. I felt listened to and understood. I look forward to working with this doctor and clinic until I am well again.|She was a wonderful doctor. I had used her because my doctor was on vacation. She came out and personally met me in the hallway prior to going into the surgery room. She thanked me for my military service. And I gave her a few of my conditions while I was going to be there and she was very accepting
Highly recommended doctor, and even more, if you have anxiety or issues being in a surgery center, she provides a very calming atmosphere along with her staff. Highly recommended.|I was very pleased that the staff were able to get same day approval from my insurance, moving my injection appointment up into an appointment that was opened by a canceled appointment.  When you are eager for pain relief, this is a real gift.

Dr. Jarzombek is friendly and really cares.|Great experience on all 3 procedures. I hope the results are life changing for me! Thank you and all your team Dr. J|Greater Austin Pain Center -- Dripping Springs is a great medical provider, and Dr. Jarzombek is the best I have ever dealt with in her field of medicine.  The staff is courteous, and the nurses, PA -- all of them are wonderful.  They take the time to listen to me and deal with any concerns I may have, and put things in terms I understand.  It's so reassuring that I have people like them caring for my medical needs.  They are my favorite in all of my medical care!  Thanks to them for all they do|I just saw Dr. J this morning, as a new patient, and I don't think I have EVER met a more caring doctor. Very sweet!  And she listened to me!  I am honestly looking forward to seeing her next time.|The process went smoothly and everyone on intake and discharge was very nice. They also kept me updated on when I would be taken back.
Once I entered the procedure room, although everyone knew their tasks, and all went well, I had no idea what to expect. Finally I asked and someone answered, ""I'm going to tell you. You'll feel a sharp pinch"", (I did), and now some pressure, the meds going in, you're done""!
I have no idea who was talking or if a Doc or nurse preformed the procedure. No one introduced themselves. As I was being wheeled out, a person in the corner with head covering and mask turned and said, ""Have a happy Thanksgiving"". Maybe it was the Doc, maybe not. Couldn't tell.
I was wheeled to the recovery room, checked over, and then right outside and I walked to my car. Done.
This was my first visit and while all this may be normal, it seemed a bit impersonal to me. I had hoped to see the Doc either before or after as I had a couple questions, but, no.
I did ask, in the procedure room, how many of these they did in a day. Someone said up to about 40!
So... they herd them in an out pretty fast. But maybe do 35, and take a minute to say hi to the person on the table.

Their scheduling department is a mess. The Dr told me they would call to schedule for my procedure within 2 weeks, never got a call, I did get a text (6 weeks later) telling me they got the order from the dr and would contact me soon. Never heard from them.  Got a call from them after 2 months telling me they needed to reschedule my follow up (I didn'teven know i had), I asked what the follow up was for and was told rudely that everyone has a follow up. I told her the procedure was never done and she argued with me! I attempted multiple times to contact the appointment line for procedures, was transferred to ""my"" scheduler, left multiple messages but they never called back. So frustrating, I finally gave up and won't ever be back.|Got my referral send from my doctor at md andersonn . Waited 9 days called the office lady told me they were waiting on paper work from other clinic waited 10 more days called back lady did not even know what was going on told her what last lady Said was told oh she don't know what she was talking about though I all ready was a patient and that I need to sign forms and wait for paper work  have been in pain going on a month waiting for this office witch has no idea what is going on now have to have my doctor give me another referral if I had 10 arms I would give this place 10 thumbs down they do not care about you as a person that only care if your insurance pays|The BEST patient portal communication ever!! I was really surprised how quickly they responded to my question. Literally less than 30 minutes. I am definitely using that way from now on.

Also, Dr. Jones is wonderful. I'm grateful for his kindness and patience with my 71 year old mom and helping her with relief from her chronic pain.|Dr Iyer is absolutely amazing. My Nina is almost 80 and for the first time  she had an amazing experience. She had stuff injected in her knee and it's always been a horrible experience anywhere she's had something done at. He was amazing! Highly recommend him!!!|I had a new patient appointment that I was 20 minutes early for. Filled out there multiple forms of repeat information. I sat in the waiting room for 40 minutes past my appointment time so I was there a total of 60 minutes. Everyone that was there before me and after me were seen. I sat there with no updates for 40 minutes. No one said anything to me. Then I heard someone say ""is she still here did she leave yet"". At that time I stood up said I wasn't waiting anymore and asked to reschedule. Two days later and the $161 dollars I paid has not been refunded. They are claiming it was a missed appointment. This office was a mess from the receptionist who wouldn't look me in the eye and was just rude to the statement by them that all the current doctors are leaving anyway and it will be all new staff February 1st. I wasn't told about all the doctors leaving until I went to reschedule, so I could've decided if I wanted  to see someone who was leaving or reschedule with another provider.
I do not recommend the Texas City location.|Doctors and nurse practitioners are great but the administration, medicine, and billing department is the worst in the business.  If the ball can be dropped they will drop it every time.  I know 6 different people go through the same thing I do with them every time.  Half the time they loose your results, late getting you your prescriptions.  P.s.  if you loose receipts don't ever pay with cash.  They also try to charge twice for visits and drug screens and I've had to prove from bank statements multiple times.  Also if you are over 10 min late they charge a no show fee of $50, but multiple times over the years I've got there early and waited over 2 1/2 hours to be seen.  If you talk to someone to make changes or communicate with the doctors to find out why your medications haven't been sent to the pharmacy which is pretty common, be sure you get the  name and location of whoever you talk to because as soon as you hang up the phone it will be like you never called and whatever they were supposed to make notes of or put into their system in regards to your call, chart, etc  won't be in the system. Constantly the worst infrastructure and accountability I've ever seen in any business.  There are multiple locations and I've been to four of them and all four are the same results.   I thought when they changed over from International Pain & Spine to Principal Pain and Spine it would get better but nothing has changed.|I have been going there for years now. I have something there is no cure for. In pain 24/7. I have always been treated with respect from Doctor Reyes to the two other what I would call PAs in pain management. Some times the office staff is not polite but those never seem to last long. The girls in there now seem just fine to me and I hope they stay and continue to be polite.  Hate to even be a patient but I do not have a choice and glad for this clinic!!! Good place!!!!!|Dr's don't care about the patient. They have re-scheduled my appointment over three times one because the doctor has an emergency and the other two they did not even could tell me why. The wait is extensive while you hear laughter in the back. Not professional at all. I do not recommend this set of doctors to anyone that want to be consider a patient . I don't see the health care not the health in this office. Just recently I was called by the office and they rescheduled my appointment. I took a day off and when I came to the office the lady said I was not scheduled. In the meantime I had to deal with the pain, pain management doctor really! No meds for over a month.

There's always plenty of parking and the offices and rest rooms are very clean. It sounds to me like most of these other reviewers must have went in the wrong entrance lol. Thank you all Dr Alvarado and staff.|I have been going to the Texas Pain Institute for 3 years now. My first Doctor was Dr. Alvarado, he left for Arizona. Although Dr. Alvarado was my first pain doctor that really helped me when he left Dr. Aggrawal (the head doctor became my new pain advisor and pain doctor.) I was nervous at first, now he has also become one of my favorite pain doctors. (I have had pain doctors since 2011) I would recommend Texas Pain Institute.

New update: September 9, 2024 -- this office was one of the best! Now trying to get an appointment in Denton is like pulling teeth. Also, there has been  a problem with my prior authorization of medicine (That I had for years) and cannot get a hold of anyone to call us back or help us. I assume the only way to get help is to go to whatever location the office people are that day. I don't know what to do anymore. The government rulings about chronic pain have become the maze of mazes.|If I could give less than a 1 star I would. I went to Dr A for about 5 years and then they hired Christopher Humphrey. From the moment I met him he was argumentative told me that I looked ""worried"" without even introducing himself. Talks down to women. He seems to be a very very unhappy person. Warning - this PA will make sure that you are no longer able to see a pain management doctor again. Be aware and stay away from Christopher Humphrey. They will make up lies saying that your urine test are negative so they can no longer treat you. He has no concern or care about an individual being in chronic pain.|I have to say that after all the pain doctors I have seen through the years Dr. Alvarado has been the best most professional understanding and compassionate dr I have seen. He actually explains the whole situation to where you can understand the treatment he is wanting to go with. He won't push surgery on you unless it is the last option. I've been seeing him for the last 5 yrs and he has done more to help control my pain including placing a spinal cord stimulator in and finally had me on the right medication to help control the pain. I also have to say that he was so very compassionate and caring when I was diagnosed with cancer and he totally would work with me if I couldn't come in due to being so sick from the chemo he would work with me and let me come in when I was feeling good enough to come in for my follow ups. We need more drs like him but it's sad to say he has left the TPI office and he will be surely missed. The new dr that came in isn't as caring or understanding of my situation and is very rude and doesn't take time to explain or even listen to your concerns on certain issues you may be having. Unfortunately now I have been forced to find a new dr due to they informed me that they do not take my insurance as of 2yrs ago but yet they've been seeing me with no problems until yesterday and the new staff in front were extremely rude and wouldn't even help me with suggesting how to be able to help me in what to do to continue being able to see them, or what I could do to find a new dr. They just said you will not be seen again there and basically don't try to go through them for anything. Nothing like feeling helpless and being thrown out to the wolves! I most definitely will not recommend this office to any of my friends that need a professional dr to help with their pain. Now I'm stuck with no pain management routine and stuck with a stimulator in my back with no chance of getting help with it anymore. Very disappointed in how fast this office has gone downhill in the last couple of months! Good luck to anyone who can actually get the help they need from them. I gave a five star rating while Dr. Alvarado was there, but now in my opinion I would give it a 2!|Dr. Alvarado is the greatest!! Very nice, friendly, warm and inviting. He actually listens if you have concerns/problems and really advocates for his patients and not just a pill pusher. The front office staff is also great. They are very friendly and helpful. If you have a schedule change or billing questions, they'll find you an answer before you leave the office.
Seriously the greatest doctor's office.|Dr. Alvarado and his staff are amazing, however, I had a really horrible experience with his male PA. He was argumentative, spoke aggressively as well as condescending to me. He was defensive and threatening even going so far as to tell me I need a med clinic, not their office because if I'm not willing to do a more invasive procedure such as surgery that they have every right to stop prescribing my meds. I have been on the same meds for years, and they work. I'm not taking any kind of hard core opiate, and I have never run out of meds, go to all my appointments, and am always engaged in my care. The way he treated me was despicable, and as a former nurse, not how we're tought to treat our patients...as if they were one of our own family members! It makes me wonder how he treats the elderly that come in and can't stand up for themselves or even know the right questions to ask! Because of my medical knowledge, and previous experience with pain management and this office specifically, I was able to call him on some of the things he told me, and I've refused to see him in the future. He talks a good game, but he's rude, disrespectful, and clearly in the WRONG career!|I have been a patient of Dr. Alvarado's for 3+ years (Shirley Cawyer ) (above is my husband)  He has helped give my life back.  He surgically implanted an intrathecal pain pump in 2019 and my quality of life has greatly improved.  I am so thankful to you Dr. Alvarado.  I am sorry to say I cannot give such glowing reviews of the rest of his staff.  The front office is like a revolving door. Of course I have been a patient during the pandemic and that could have something to do with it.  Dr could be a better communicator.  I didn't understand what Drs policy on Rx refills and requests were.  That could have been smoother.   I don't know if he thought I knew more than I knew.  I should have come to my visit prepared with all the questions and concerns I had.  It has taken a while to get to the ""sweet spot"" with my therapy.  I am sorry he is moving.  Denton patients will sorely miss him.|Dr. Alvarado and his staff have always been really great with me. His bedside manner is awesome. He makes you feel really comfortable. He really cares about you being able to manage your pain! I recommend him to anyone needing to manage their pain.

She is that kind of person that comes off as genuine, selfless and has an ability to make you feel great. Her spirit is infectious and incredible. Chris is my provider, he is attentive and thorough. He is easy to talk to and always addresses my concerns. I was moved around from provider to provider for a while until I landed with him. I am extremely happy with him and he was worth the wait to get to. The office is eager to help with appointments. I actually forgot an appointment one day even with being reminded. I was notified and I felt so dumb. I was seen the very next day as they were able to squeeze me in. I am only doing 4 stars because the first provider I saw wasn't agreeable to me. She came off as snobby and didn't want to listen to what I was saying. I addressed this with the office manager and I haven't had to deal with her again. Sometimes when you lodge a complaint you can be labeled a troublesome patient. I was nervous this would happen at Advance pain care. I assure you this is not the case. They all treat me with dignity and care. Please do not forget about Tiffany. Say hi to her. She will brighten your day. She certainly brightened mine, even though I was sad and depressed just receiving news my father was rushed to the Hospital by an ambulance. I did not let them know this was weighing on me, so it makes Tiffany's warm nature and ability to help people seem so much more profound.|I can not believe this location has a 4.6?
I waited 45 minutes in the room while listening to laughing, and personal conversations.
The nurse's aid asked if I could leave a sample, and I said I need some water. She said she'd bring me some then walked out. After 20 minutes I just fill my cup up from the sink in the room and started drinking water. Once I finally had to go, I asked where the restroom was at and was directed.
Walking through the sea of staff just talking and chatting it up, (which to me, Ive never seen anything like it). It was like a house party. I think it's rude especially when the people that are there are sick, and in pain. It was a very unprofessional environment. I went and left a sample walked back through the sea of employees, looked at the nurse's aid chatting it up with another employee and went back to the room but left the door open to get some air and to hopefully remind them I was waiting. At 40 minutes I went up to the counter to ask what the hold up was? I was told I'm next. I went back to the room and sat down. The nurse's aid walked in and said the PA would be here shortly. I looked at here and said, did you forget to bring my water? She said, I was on the phone. I knew that was a straight up lie because I walked right by her while she was laughing and talking to a coworker. She didn't even offer me water. It was like the conversation never happened.
When the PA came in she apologized for the wait. I didn't say anything. She asked what hurts? I said nothing has changed. She didn't even know what is wrong with me. She continued to ask me what hurts? She didn't know 1 single thing about my condition.
Then she turned into a used car salesperson try to shove procedure down my throat. We discussed treatment of steroid injection which does help temporarily but I told her I don't want to do it if my insurance won't pay for it because I just has prostate surgery which the insurance approved initially but then after, I had it denied, so I have to pay for it. She said the insurance would pay but they needed another MRI. I told her I have to get an MRI and CT scan next week for my prostate and I don't want to do another MRI. She said fair enough. She had a look on her face like she lost a sale. Like she failed a sale.
As of today 2/6/25 my RX medication is supposed to be refilled. I called the pharmacy before they closed and they said your doctor hasn't sent anything in. This HAS NEVER HAPPENED.
I'm really glad that at least I have medication to get me through until I can call the doctor tomorrow.
This place is 100%  AN ABSOLUTE JOKE.
( with the exception of the front desk).
I'll never go to this location again. My normal office was short staffed so I went to this location.
I've been to the Cedar Park, and Round Rock location and they are awesome.
If you are sick and in pain DO NOT GO HERE. I felt like I was treated like cattle, and some idiot.
I'm writing this 3 hours after this experience and I'm still upset.|I have been a patient at Advanced Pain Care  (APC) off and on for a number of years. I have been treated for the following issues: fractured vertebrae, open wound VAC healing/debreadment as well as extreme muscle pain.  I have found everyone with whom I've come in contact to be enormously attentive, concerned, and dedicated to helping me through my issues. I'd like to highlight the attention I receive regularly from Nurse Destiny, and the Physicians Assistant named Chris.   Thank You APC, Georgetown!|Great rheumatologists but the billing takes forever still dealing with an infusion billing issue since 4/11/24 it is now 10/15/24. They set me up with a copay program and I've basically had to make every call to them to figure out how to get reimbursed because they wanted to bill me for something the copay program covers. I keep calling and they say they will do it but I have yet to see it done.|Advanced Pain Care in Georgetown Is absolutely the best. We moved to Georgetown six years ago. I was leaving beloved doctors that I had had for over 25 years. I wanted someone closer to where I live now and I needed a Rheumatologist. I saw Dr. Pegram and he took the time and cared for me like he had known me for a very long time. I have seen other doctors and P.A.'s  there as well and they are all amazing. In the past when I've left their office, I thought about doing a review. I've never done one anywhere., , but today was an exceptional experience. Their computers were down and there were several people waiting to get checked in. Emma was at the front desk and she took care of each one of us like she always does, she's calm under fire and always has a smile. I still got in on time and left on time. Each person in the office I've met is special, I think they're all there for a reason. They all are compassionate and do everything that they can to help people feel better. They see people who are hurting with chronic pain with heavy hearts and for a lot of us, it took all they could do-just to get there that day. They don't get good sleep, they're fatigued and have been in pain for years and every single day is hard, just to get through the day. They understand THAT , they care and they work with you to help you. They can only do as much as we can tell them and try to explain what is going on with us and sometimes we just don't have the words. Nikki (Dr. Pegram's (M.A.) ) is always amazing. She helps me find those words and then she helps me feel better. I wonder how many stories they hear like mine and how much pain they see every day, I am so thankful for them. Through the years since I've been here, I have been slowly feeling better and better. Today when I left the office, I realized, that I feel better now - Than when all of this fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis started so long ago.  I was in my 30s when I first got fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. For 30 years, I've been living in pain, chronic pain, Which brought on depression and each day I was just trying to get through day. I'm 66 now and for all this time I have felt old and tired, like I was 100. Today I'm going to go play with my great grand-babies and see my friends and  go for a walk with my husband. Advanced Pain Care and the people who work there have given me back my life and I can't tell you how good that feels.
I'm always so cautious of peoples time and try to keep things short. I know everyone's time is precious. I'm sorry,  but I don't care if this is so long.  The people at that office changed my life, day by day and year by year.
I talked to Daniel today. He's the manager,  and just seeing his smile melts your heart, and he keeps everything running like a well oiled clock. Andrea usually checks me out and again with a smile. Today Tiffany checked me out, they were overloaded because she usually does x-rays. She's wonderful, I could go on, but now I'm feeling guilty, but I have to mention Dr. Dennis and his staff, Stephanie and Shannon , And the 15 other people that make that office work. I haven't met them all but I see them working. and again, I am so thankful for each of them. If you've been hurting, you don't have to , or at least not that bad.  There are things they can do. They can help you if you give them a chance. It breaks my heart to see so much pain. They are a family of compassionate and caring professionals that truly want to do all they can to help you. I started feeling better in little ways, just helping me to sleep better and have a little bit more energy. It seems like it's just baby steps, but in time when you look back , You will be able to see the difference. I hope you can give yourself the gift of going to Advanced Pain Care for help, and give it time because I promise it will help.
I'm done, gotta go  
Thank you, thank you to each and everyone of you working at Advanced Pain Care. You are a hard-working, compassionate, and special group of people and I am so thankful that you are there.|This team is amazing, PA Jordan Waldron has given my life back to me, she's an awesome person.

I am hopeful about what his protocols can do.|Dr. Groysman & his team are so wonderful.  I came in for 2 SGB's and an EAT procedure.  I flew in and felt so comfortable with the staff.  I got some relief from my long covid and dysautonomia as well!  I came back the next day for an ANS test and you couldn't ask for a more knowledgeable doctor and staff who have experience!|When I first engaged with Dr. Groysman I was at the point of desperation due to intense long Covid symptoms. Before seeing him I had seen numerous doctors who were unable to provide much help. Some of their recommendations actually made me more sick. Dr. Groysman developed a treatment protocol specific to my situation and my needs. I'm not being dramatic when I say with these treatments I have been resurrected.
I'm no longer struggling with debilitating cognitive, emotional and physical fatigue. My crushing headaches, head pressure and tinnitus are gone. The horrible cough that kept me from sleeping for more than a year and a half is gone. My body feels like I'm alive again.
I still have to pace myself as my body continues to heal. But it's simply life changing to be able to hold a conversation without feeling as if I'm going to collapse, to enjoy cooking again, walk my puppy, grocery shop, or go to the nursery.
Thank you Dr. G and your amazing staff. You saved my life!|Dr. Groysman patiently listened and made great suggestions during a telemed visit. Looking forward to working with him and his clinic in the future.|Dr. Groysman and his team are fantastic! I had to fly in from Belize and they were so great at helping me get things all arranged. The experience with my SGB and EATS  was better than we had even hoped for! I am 1 full week out from treatment and feeling 60-70 % better than I have felt in over 2 years! So very highly recommend!|After months of unbearable back pain, I discovered Southwest Pain Management in Irving, Texas. Their approach is unique, focusing on interventional techniques. I opted for the Discseel injections, and the relief was more than I could have hoped for. Their detailed information and care plan on their website really helped me understand what to expect.

Over the past three years, he has helped me make incredible breakthroughs that I never thought were possible. When I first started seeing him, I was trapped in bed at home, unable to live my life. Thanks to his expertise and personalized treatment approach, I'm now able to go out, reconnect with friends, and even attend parties. The progress we've made together has been truly life-changing, and I couldn't be more grateful.

The communication between Dr. Irfan and me is always very clear, and he takes the time to make sure I understand every part of my treatment plan. His office staff is also incredibly competent and easy to work with, making the entire process smooth and stress-free.

Trash overflowing, blood around toilet.  Did not provide good service.|My appointment was scheduled for 11 AM, but the experience was a complete disaster. I waited over an hour just to be called into the room where they check your blood pressure, only to be left sitting there for another hour before finally seeing a doctor. What's the point of scheduling an appointment if they clearly have no intention of honoring it? This place shows zero respect for your time. It's obvious they couldn't care less about their patients. I would never recommend this place to anyone--nothing but negative things to say about this establishment. Absolutely unacceptable.|I hate this place 2nd time being seen. My doctor (Dr.Irfan) refused to fill out my form for my job has he told me he doesn't get paid to fill out forms. I have insurance I pay to get seen at the office at the office I've never experience anything like this . The best office that I was seen was comprehensive spine center, but it's bad enough they stop taking insurance and referred me out to Texas Pain Physicians.|I absolutely Love this place. Their service is always a great experience. Very professional and courteous. Dr. Elhady always gets me right! So right that I danced the sole right off my boot! Great Job Done! Great Staff!|Scheduling is problematic. You cancel in advance and they claim you didn't then try to charge you penalty. They cancel  because their nurse practitioners quit a lot but the office doesn't tell you. Then you have to wait and wait as an unscheduled walk in. One teleappointment during covid the doctor blew me off completely then said the office was NOT charging me as a courtesy! Scheduling service needs a lot of help.

That immediately through me off! The doctor came in and had me stand, wal, bend over and stick my hands out to test strength. He literally said one sentence to me. They immediately placed me on list to have numerous injections with no anesthesia unless I paid $100 cash everytime. I was given a minimal dose of an opioid and muscle relaxers. I went ahead with the first injection without the costly anesthesia. It hurt so bad for weeks. I've had chronic pain since I was in my late twenties. Several accidents, severe arthritis, Lupus pain, Connective Tissue Disease and osteoporosis. Every part of my body hurts 24/7. I don't remember ever not having pain! It's horrible! I continued going in against my better judgement. I believe it was my 5th visit at 9am. I literally got out of bed, dressed, brushed my teeth and used my listening as I have for 40 years, did my hair and makeup. Got there did my urine test and 45 minutes later get called in the back that my urine test was positive for alot and recent alcohol. I don't drink and haven't since I tried a drink when I was 17. Hated it and never drank again. There were the nurse, an office worker and finally the doctor all in my face interrogating me. I told them only thing it could of been was my listerine and I don't drink it I swish it. Doctor said swishing listerine wasnt strong enough to show up in pee. I was livid! I asked for another pee test because they pile all these pee cups on the counter with a stick in it right close together.  My guess someone made a mistake during the test. I asked for another test and they said no but to feel free to go elsewhere and pay out of pocket which I didn't have so I left with no prescription and feeling down. About 9 months-a year later I had been sick with covid then pneumonia. I was given antibiotics and the cough pearls tesla I think. They also called in another liquid medication for my cough. I called the pain management office told them what was happening. Also, had to leave a message for the nurse. I took exactly 2 doses of the liquid medicine and she called me told me not to take it anymore and bring it to them mind you I'm still sick. I told her I could not come until I was over the pneumonia and covid. She then told the doctor and by being sick as hell I wasn't supposed to take anything unless they approved first. I was released as a patient for being severely ill. This place is a joke! They push the injections and want to charge for anesthesia for injections. They really don't give much meds to help your pain. And, in my opinion they need to be closed down! Period.|I been seeing Dr Chouteau since 2014. I have been pleased with her care as well as her staff. She gives back injections and I do not use any anesthesia besides the local to numb where she puts the needle in. What a magician.|The young girl working at the front desk she's been so polite and very professional and she touched my heart from listening to me on the computer working with Empower I just want to say thank you you have made a difference in my life and thank you for caring. Sincerely Mr Pete Rivas from Wichita Falls Texas she's only been their for only 6 months again thank you  have a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year|Dr.Morsy is disrespectful and unprofessional. He only assessed my problem area for one second and pushed way too hard even though I was there for pain in that area and it was very tender. No bed side manner. No respect for his patients. He's a bad listener! I had to repeat the same things over and over to him! He medically gaslights and talks down to you, being very condescending and confrontational. He was very argumentative. I was there for a completely different nerve than the one he wanted to schedule for injection. He kept looking at his watch the whole time!! Rude! I will go somewhere else.|I was very pleased to meet the Dr Elhady, she was the best Dr I ever met,  the reason I am putting my review because of lack of communication with their staff with the patient. I was out of pocket patient and being very bad pain after consulting the Dr she prescribed medication but after 3 days I tried to contact the Dr office to pass my message that I am not getting relief for my pain. But unfortunately despite I am keep contacting the Dr office with their staff I didn't hear from them,  every time they said all staff are busy. It's very surprising for me not a single person contact me and I got another email for my next appointment. How can an out of pocket patient can pay such a big money all the time, so I have decided to find another Dr. But I must say that there is a big lack of communication with their department which creates really bad impression. I already sent an email to the Director of business as well.  Very disappointed|Dr. Alex Golden has truly been an answer to my prayers! I recently relocated to Texas from out of state, and as many of you who are  reading this know, it is often a challenge to get a new pain management team set up to meet your needs. Dr. Golden not only recognized my previous plan but added several new modalities. Also, she is very gifted when administering injections. Additionally, the support staff is knowledgeable, professional and caring! Even the phone support team is an A++++! Thank you, Dr. Golden for your compassionate care!!|Dr. Dalya Elhady is a caring, compassionate, and very learned medical professional and surgeon. She recently placed an SCS implant in my back to in an effort to help reduce the need for oral medications and injections. It seems that a lot of people are leaving negative reviews and complaining about her cutting their meds back. Dr. Elhady's desire to help people deal with chronic pain without a constant and/or increasing need for opioids is not only her desire to do what's in the best interest of the patient, but also to treat patients in accordance with government regulations that are beyond her control.|Arrived on Friday at 2:00pm for a 2:15pm appointment for medication refill. There were quite a few other people in the waiting room. I ended up waiting until 3:00pm to go back into a room. After speaking with the medical assistant, I ended up waiting another 30 minutes for the doctor to show up. We went over what the next steps were. And was told he would send in refill my medication.When I went to check out (4:00pm) I asked how long it would take for my pharmacy to receive the prescription. I was told he has until the end of day, at 5pm. Ok, I understand. We'll 5 o'clock came and passed. I called back up and left a message at 6pm. Didn't receive a call back. At 9ish, I messaged the doctor on the portal stating my pharmacy never received the prescription. It's now the next day, Saturday. Wouldn't you know the offices are closed until Monday. I understand sometimes you have to wait a while to see the doctor. However I shouldn't have to wait 3 days for a prescription. I had a very unprofessional experience, that quite literally left me in pain.",2024-11-15|2024-10-07|2024-12-12|2024-07-11|2024-03-10|2023-11-07|2024-05-10|2024-04-13,1|5|5|1|1|5|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Does he prescribe opiates?",Yes,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ08WfL-ggTIYRXFmViEPVwDc,42

I was given three days of pain medication and the weekend was coming! No one would see me, no one would help me... Until I called Ascent. They treated me so well. I was helped right away, had an appointment the next day. I highly recommend them over Integrated Pain solutions, they were horrible. I may have only needed them for that month, but at that time, it really changed my overall well-being. Thank you so much!|Really thought I was at the right place and right doctor. They tell me they will do the disectomy surgery, then never heard back. One of the ladies said she was a director of the pain clinic first told me ""I will call you back in an hour, never heard back from her until I called her on Tuesday. She said they are still trying to get a quote. Two weeks and no quote, no call, no text, no return calls.

I thought I had a right place, but once again it's another pain clinic that over promises and under delivered. It's said these places have NO empathy for their clients. The director said we don't want to lose your business that tells me I'm a dollar sign only.

Addition, went to spine doctor, they reviewed the procedure ascent did, said the reason injection did work, is the didn't do it properly, there went $1,000.00 for nothing, said that's the reason it only
lasted 36 hours, says to many want to be pain clinics that don't ever provided any service, did get a name and number to file medical complaints about this place.

Funny they only accept 5 stars reviews and not anything less, that's why there are 12 reviews and only review are 5 stars because the other 7 are 1 star reviews. So there real rating is 41%, still 40% to high

What I find is they remove poor reviews to make them look better. Posted this review about 6 months ago, and it was removed, also notice a lot of the other poor reviews were deleted.|Awesome Awesome Clinic! Dr.Mahendru & Dr.Burgess are amazing.

I have had nothing but the best experiences coming here. I wish I had them 10 years ago when I 1st had my accident.|My experience with spine and pain clinic was absolutely outstanding, the staff was very friendly and helpful Dr. Mohammed Arif was very nice. I highly recommend Spine and Joint Clinic.|OMG!! I can't believe how simple and unpainful my procedure was. Without any anesthesia!!! Dr. Arif Muhammed told me I had nothing to worry about and he was Right!!! I've been put under anesthesia for so many years for my procedures, and didn't feel comfortable not having being put to sleep. Now, I'm just in Awwwww. Thank You to all employees at this clinic......IF YOU'RE HAVING IN BACK, KNEE, SHOULDER, BONE PROBLEMS THIS IS THE PLACE TO COME|Dr Arif is an awesome  dr as he listen to what you tell him and show him where exactly  the pain is located  in my back and help me reduce  the pain I just wish we can fix it completely  and be pain free. Thanks Dr Arif  Deb|I went to see Dr Arif 2 months ago for chronic pelvic pain that I've been dealing with after years of pain and adenomyosis & endometriosis after my old doctors practice was shut down. As we all know, gaslighting of women in medicine is a huge issue and this doctor is no different. First of all, i am not permitted to take NSAIDs and also have to be extremely careful of steroids because of a previous stomach surgery and ulcer risks, and was told at my first appointment he understood this and that hed prescribe some rescue meds for days when my pain is unbearable. Not only was i not prescribed anything, at my next appointment 2 weeks later, i was given an injection in my hip (which is NOT the source of my pain) and told that it would ""make my pain go away."" When i asked what was in the injection, i was not given a clear answer and had to google, only to find out that i was injected with steroids after i was explicit that i was not comfortable with steroid injections because of possible systemic effects. Not surprisingly, my chronic soft tissue pelvic pain was not fixed by this injection and in fact it caused me additional pain in my hip for several days that wasnt there previously. Dr Arif, if youre reading this, do not insult my intelligence. I am not dumb, and your gaslighting is not okay.
To make it worse, I was referred to your practice by a friend who did receive at home pain management medications, but he is a man so I guess his pain is more legitimate than mine? Is that what it is? I understand the difficulties faced with prescribing medication, but if you were not going to do that then be honest with your patients. Do not waste my time and money and send me on my way.
I left your office feeling defeated, with more pain in a place I never had pain to begin with, and angry because I was injected with something I told you I wasn't comfortable with. Not okay. I didn't even receive the back brace you insisted on, which also by the way doesn't begin to address my pain but I was willing to try everything just to get help. I will not be coming back, and if you are a woman with chronic pain that may be considered ""invisible"" (pain that is apparently comparable to a heart attack) DO NOT GO HERE. This doctor is a joke. Again, do not I insult my intelligence.|I visited with Dr. Arif today for spinal pain and arthritis of the neck. He is a very compassionate and knowledgeable Doctor. I would highly recommended him based on my experience.|The best Pain Clinic I've ever been to!! Trust me when I say the Doctor and the entire staff is knowledgeable and they listen to your needs and put a plan of action in place that you agree to. They care! I was treated with respect and they were compassionate and kind!! We will continue to travel from McKinney just because of how wonderful they are! Switch pain Doctors to Spine and Pain Clinic of Texas in Plano! Don't wait!! Awesome care!|My first visit with Spine&Pain clinic in Plano, TX with Dr. Muhammad Arif was great.

He is compassionate and listens and also takes time to inform you of exactly what is happening.
My only issue with the clinic is a misrepresentation of insurance in network services. I was casually asked to sign a form when checking out of my 1st appointment consenting to pay the anesthesiologist bill if not covered by my insurance. I was uncomfortable signing and stated at the time that I would like all services to be in network and was told that they would confirm that along with a total $ for procedure.
Over 3 weeks I have called 3 times.
2 days before the procedure was booked for I called again to request a total and to confirm that the anesthesiologist was in network.
After speaking to 3 very nice people it turns out they do not have nor ever did have an in network anesthesiologist and I would be responsible for a max out of pocket of $400.
I was told about third party billing, new set of code and rules etc which I'm sure all apply. My disappointment is that this was never explained to me despite repeated phone calls requesting the info until I had to insist 2 days before my procedure. My advice to anyone that is looking to use this clinic is to confirm the services and billing ahead of time and DO NOT FEEL PRESSURED into signing a form agreeing to pay for anything out of network if you are uncomfortable and without the cost up front. You are entitled to this by law.",2024-12-31|2024-12-10|2021-08-19|2025-02-11|2024-04-10|2024-12-05|2024-01-22|2022-08-30,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|3,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJNWMYiGJzToYRzmdLv8-PuJc,36

They required me to turn over medication from my primary care doctor and I am still waiting for them to call in a new prescription.  Of course,  no one is available to contact after 5.  As icing on the cake while I was waiting for my test, a young woman tested positive for a fever over 100.  They let her cool off and after a trip to the bathroom she had her temp retested at 99, at which time she was allowed to go in.  When I went back she was dresses in black with other ?doctors.  She wasn't a nurse.  This made me very nervous.  It just doesn't seem like a very professional establishment.|I came to IPA after my car wreck and have been seeing Dr. McDavid all this time.

How yall doin?  I pray the people reading  this post are blessed  and highly  favored. I am going to send a shout-out to Miss Amy. The Big Dawg in the Physical therapy  room. She is large and in charge but comes in a tiny package.  She is so kind, caring, and compassionate.  She is knowledgeable  about her profession. She is very attentive  when she is evaluating  you for physical  therapy.  She takes her time.  She listens to everything you tell her. She gives great advice, feedback , and suggestions to help you improve your condition.She makes you feel so comfortable.
I have back issues, neck issues, 2 knee replacements, 2 rotator cuff surgeries, 3 carpal tunnel surgeries, and 2 auto immune diseases that affect muscles, nerves, and joints It is a lot to deal with. But by the grace of God. I am still standing tall in mind, body, and spirit.
Ms. Amy made a recommendation  to confer with a podiatrist. His name is Dr. J.Landry in Arlington.  She described how the joints are interconnected and work  together to make the joints  move in sync with each other. Ms. Amy went on to tell me how the foot  joints can or maybe the culprit to knee and back pain.I went to AOA yall. Lord , I just have to shake my head. I consulted with them initially about my back and foot. It was a big mistake. Dr. W told me Miss Amy didn't  know what she was talking about. He is a professional, and she is just a physical  therapist. The way he talked to me was insulting and hurtful. I never went back. I thought about it. I got a referral from Dr. Hermine and went to see Dr. Landry. I started treatment with my foot. Eventually, I had surgery  to correct my foot problem. Guess what, yall? There was a bone, Dr. Landry put back into position. Immediately a few days after foot surgery, I noticed my right knee was not hurting anymore. I could bend down, get up, move, and walk so much better. I was so grateful to God . I had a knee replacement. It was so painful. I had this surgery in 2018. My back pain was excruciating. I had the foot surgery  in 2024. The recommendation  that Ms. Amy made it on point! I am so much better from the recommendation  she made. So Guess who was wrong when he said  that he was more professionally  trained and Ms Amy didn't  know what she was talking about!!! Now, Dr. Weiser is a great surgeon for some people but not for me. He was wrong!! I don't  mind saying it.
If you are looking for excellent physical  therapy I highly recommend  Ms. Amy. She does an excellent job in what she does. Regency Physical  therapy  employees, great people, the Sargeant Ms. Brittany, Amazing Amanda,Gracey full of Grace, Venia for Victory and Gabe Mr. baseball !! They all work well together with Ms. Amy leading the way. They are great with all the patients . They  all have helped me at different stages in my life to get stronger and  better mentally,physically , and spiritually.It has helped me to live a better life and deal with pain in a more effective  way.When you know better you can do better.  It takes  time ,dedication , and a lot of hard work.  If you  need physical  therapy, choosing Regency  Pain & therapy is an excellent  choice. I just had to give you props, Ms. Amy. Go head, girl!!!|I'm a patient of Dr. Cindy NG, she's a wonderful doctor! My latest visit was today 1/13/25 and I waited for that one, but I didn't mind waiting because she's a good doctor. She's very caring and thoughtful person. She listens to my concerns and explain anything l have a issue with. She's really takes time to help her patients. Thanks Dr. NG! (I only gave 4 stars because the exam room was freezing!)|I was a new patient to Regency Pain. I needed to reschedule an appointment. Called 12 times Monday to no avail. No one ever answered the phone!! I tried calling 4-5 times on Tuesday morning and same thing happened. Finally, I at least found a line that went through to an answering machine, so I left a message.
The nice young lady who responded said that sometimes they have to just let phones go unanswered because everyone is too busy to answer incoming calls!! I decided I would find another pain doctor if their staff was allowing phone calls to go unanswered.|Dr.Ng is one of the most attentive and caring physicians around. She looks into things deeper than surface level and truly cares about her patient's health. Not just pushing you through the door to get to the next one. Doctors like her are hard to come by. Thanks for all you do, Dr. Ng definitely my favorite doctor!|Dr. NG is one of the best!! She's attentive, compassionate and knowledgeable. She takes the time to evaluate and determine the best treatment to get the maximum results. I have been seeing Dr. NG for almost two years and highly  recommend her.|Dr Sacky is very patient care focused rather than trying to get to the next appointment he spends time with me and answers all my questions.  He also takes care to not over extend my finances which is very much appreciated.|I was able to see Doctor Dirnberger. The visit went well. He was very attentive and able to explain a lot of things to me in detail. The visit was not rushed. I appreciated the work he did to try to understand what was going on with me. Sam, his medical student was great as well. I liked the fact they took the time to look over my notes and make recommendations for me.|Dr. Butler is soo through and kind. I've had a very pleasant experience working with him on my pain. January 2025 will be 2 years with an everyday headache. I've gone through a couple of procedures to try to help the headaches but they haven't been successful but that's just my experience it could work for other people. Hermine Dr Butlers N.P. is very kind too and always makes me feel welcome. She gives hugs too lol THIS is a very professional place and I'm sure all the doctors here are great.

This is not OK.|Doctor Khan is an excellent doctor. I have been going to him since 2017. He takes his time to listen and ask questions about my issues and always been giving me great advice on how to treat my pain management. I truly appreciate his talent and his expertise in his profession. If you are looking for great doctor that would give you the time to listen to you and help you manage your pain, then you must go see Doctor Khan. I am so grateful to him for helping me to manage my pain.|Dr. Khan's level of care plummeted after my insurance changed to Medicare. Despite being a loyal patient for 8 years, his lack of concern for my quality of life and pain was appalling. He dismissed my concerns, pain, and restrictions without a second thought, leaving me feeling invalidated and uncared for. It's disheartening and disappointing that a pain management physician lacks basic compassion for someone in pain. Avoid at all costs.|Dr. Khan is always on time and makes me feel like I am his only patient. He listens and is very attentive. The staff is AWESOME. Very efficient. I love it that he can sometimes do appointments via Zoom. I can't recommend enough.|Staff and Dr Khan are excellent. Always answers the phone and tends to your needs and does their best to accommodate their patient. Wish all doctor's offices were ran like this one.  Dr. Khan is very knowledgeable and sincerely tries to help you.|I came into Dr Khan's office to get treated for pain associated with a protruding disc that was pinching my nerve.   Dr Khan was incredibly patient and described my options and helped me understand the severity of my injury.  He was very professional and made me feel at ease during the procedure by letting me know what he was going to do before he did it and informing me of what I should expect to feel.   I highly recommend Dr Khan to anyone in need of a pain doctor.  His staff were also very professional and my overall experience couldn't have been better.|Dr Khan and his team are always first class in their work & getting me to the correct resolution.   I have been going to see him/them for about seven years now whenever my back flares up.  Surgery never needed.    Don't hesitate  to book an appt.|I have lupus, arthritis and chronic nerve pain throughout my body. So I have been sent to multiple pain clinics over the years. I recently had my shoulder replaced and was referred here by the surgeon that replaced my shoulder. This is by far the best pain clinic that I have been sent to. Dr. Khan actually, legitimately cares and listens to his patients. He's NOT one of those that will insist on putting out a forest fire with a garden hose. He will care about you, listen to you and come up with a legitimate, safe plan to treat your pain. And if your pain is temporary, then he will gently, as your pain dissipates, walk down your medication. And/Or if you have chronic pain, HE WILL come up with a more permanent solution. One thing he won't do is leave you hanging, suffering.
Another major plus about this clinic is the staff. Just like Doc Khan, his staff actually care and actually want to help you. They have helped several times to straighten out insurance or pharmaceutical issues for me and they do it in a timely manner. They ALWAYS answer the phone or return your calls. Which is something that has become very rare these days. My mother's pain clinic in Temple, TX have not answered their phone since 2010. Their (my Mother's pain clinic in Temple) favorite saying when confronted about their inability to answer the phone or return her calls is, ""Well, if you're really hurting that bad then you'll just come in to see us about any of your issues"".

When I asked to be put on my old medication at first he said no then he told me he would only give me 2 week supply as well as half the dose then have to see him again for a new visit. When I told him my other doctor prescribed it this way he got mad said I should go to him and kicked me out of his office. I have never been treated with such disrespect from a doctor in my whole life.|I am Dan's wife, Fran Schully, using his Google Account.  My experience at Dr. Hauck""s office was totally pleasant, without any undesirable occurrence!  The nurses were gentle and very excellent. The nurse who placed the needle for my IV placed it without any discomfort.  The young man who was the Anesthetist  carefully explained the procedure for beginning and ending the anesthetic.  I had no anxiety and simply went to sleep and waked up again when the procedure was finished.  I exclaimed to the nurses that I wished the whole team could have participated in my last three surgeries because the whole experience was so easy, calm, and offered no anxiety at all!
Thank you, Dr. Hauck, for having such an exemplary staff and for your expertise in performing this procedure!  I am thankful for all of you!|Great staff that treats you like family and this is the first time I've had sustainable pain relief in a long time.

I cannot get into my VA (long story)and spend thousands of dollars in treatment. Went to see Dr. Reemer and it was a joke. My back is 9/10-10 on their pain scale almost everyday. It causes sciatic pain all the way down to my feet 24/7. His answer to my pain was a urinalysis and injection..... The injection did not reduce pain, instead it created more pain.

Absolutely sickening and depressing.|Dr Remer is good, but the girl at the front desk (Shirley) is the rudest person I have ever met!!

I've been under Dr Steven Remer's care for 6 years now after undergoing 10 surgeries in the past 10 years including bilateral knee replacements. He was the only reason I was finally pointed to the correct specialists and diagnosed properly with Rheumatoid Arthritis to begin my path of healing and receiving the right biologics and treatments. This office is very sympathetic to chronic pain sufferers and holistically treats their patients in managing their pain with an internal physical therapy staff including a massage therapist and chiropractor in addition to prescription and treatment plans if needed. Dr Remer is highly skilled in various noninvasive injections (not just ""steroid shots"" but procedures such as Rhizotomies and ESI's), and this has been a key component in managing my pain over the years.

As a doctor he is supposed to offer options that I am comfortable with. I know there are more ways such as oral pain medication. Upon asking for an alternative to injections he said """"""""""this is the only option we have. Your pain must not be as bad since your rejecting injections."""""""""" I'm sorry?

I have never met a doctor as condescending as Dr. Irfan (and I'm an ER nurse, so that's saying a lot). First, he couldn't be bothered to come into the exam room.

Third, he started off by saying ""you've already seen a spine dr so why are you here"" in a demeaning tone as if he was put out that we were there. Fourth, he didn't care to take the time to listen to my wife about the pain she was experiencing. When I asked if there were any other meds she could try because nothing had worked so far he said ""no she's tried them all, continue with physical therapy then we'll do an injection."" When he asked a question my wife didn't have the answer to at the moment he said, ""this is stuff you should know, it's not rocket science."" At the end he spoke to his assistant and said ""are we seeing so and so next?"" And then he just walked out of the ""office""... I was BAFFLED.

Cons- no advanced care for chronic conditions. If you are looking for compassionate and care without constant injections, go to this clinic.

Incompetent and miscommunication of office staff at its finest.
Don't expect anything to be handled timely.
Don't expect to get an appointment right away.
If you're a Zebra and not a horse, don't go here.|DO NOT GO HERE. Doctor has 5 other locations, is only available here on Wednesdays, even then if you book an appointment it will not be honored. They use a call center and apparently even though the staff has recordings of all calls made through them they do not communicate appointment times, cancelations or bookings. Horrible service, do your self a favor, save yourself the headache. Seek advice through actual professional. Chances are you will not even see the doctor.|What a disaster this office is.
First, they don't have any signage on the building showing you where the office is. When you do get inside, there are just a bunch of paper signs taped on the wall for Dr. Irfam.
Second, as a new patient they sent me email appointment reminders with three different addresses for the office.
Third, the appointment reminder they sent had the wrong time for my appointment.
Fourth, the poor receptionist just kept dropping the ball - forgetting things, incomplete instructions, etc.

I'm amazed this place stays in business.|Dr. Irfain is the worst doctor I've ever met. He didn't care or listen to a word I said and talked about himself asking me who my last dr. Was and even looked him up and asked if he was better looking then him... what? When I came in for my back and wrist injections he stated that i was there for neck injections i had to correct him he didn't even look at my chart. When i woke up i realized he did not do my wrist injections that i reminded him about at least 5 times....i was told that i was moving to much and that he could do them if i really wanted them while awake but it will be painful....ive been put under many times I've never been told i moved around ever. I even hand surgery on my hands and everything went fine. I could he was irritated that i wanted my injections that i was supposed to have.....later i get my EOB from my insurance and he changed for wrist injections that i never received....this Dr. Is incompetent and rude. I never returned back after that and have found a sweet understanding and caring doctor. Same your time and money and find some place else they have no clue what there doing.|Please read the last paragraph.

I have been seeing Dr Irfan for over a year now after my previous pain management doctor retired. Dr Irfan has continued his education keeping him up to date on the latest developments in non invasive procedures as well as using opioids as the last option.

He also stays current with the REMS federal compliance program that establishes a relationship between the patient, pharmacy, physician and the REMS team. As a patient I have found this program to be extremely efficient as long as all the parties stay current with the REMS requirements.

Patients need to understand that the program has been put in place for the protection of all involved. It prevents patients from seeing multiple doctors for narcotics or going to various emergency departments seeking early refills or doctor shopping. Dr. Irfan and the staff go over the office policies and as long as you comply with the policies your not going to have a problem.

This process also helps the patient find comfort that the doctor they're seeing is in good standing with the medical board, is a pain medicine specialist or has met the requirements for the REMS program.

I find Dr Irfan listens to my current pain condition and makes the best decision while managing my pain and changes the medication/treatment(s) as needed.
I have nothing but awesome things to say about his clinic staff while he is seeing patients in the Grapevine Office. He sees patients at different offices throughout the metroplex during the week.

The Corp Office is a whole different issue.  I am in hopes that the issues with the Corp staff get better. I have never delt with anyone as unprofessional and flat out rude in my life.  It takes an act of CONGRESS to actually speak to the staff in the office where you see the doctor.  They NEVER return your call. The receptionist who takes your call is nothing but a stop gap measure to prevent you from speaking to the office staff.

I typically get my medications every 30 days. Because of Covid19 they went to telemedicine which is great in theory. The problem is when you do a telemedicine visit they only write for a 15 day supply. THERE IS THE PROBLEM. When they do this the insurance gets you for another copay. Plus the insurance rejects the claim because it looks like your trying to fill a 45 day supply when you get the 30 day supply on your next office visit. My pharmacy tried to address the issue with the doctor but again they get the gastopo that answers the phone and have no clue about insurance.
Sadly I hear other patients, doctors and pharmacies
talk about the same problems.Today I was at another doctors office and a lady heard me calling the office. She apologized for listening but said she has the same problems and now they have started texting patients instead of calling them directly. I won't be signing anything allowing a doctors office to text me when I have a problem.

Please don't get me wrong. Dr Irfan is wonderful and very understanding. He is just an employee like his staff. His office staff in the Grapevine office is fabulous and  very helpful.|Dr. Irfan is great. He helped my wife with her chronic pain and never talked down to her. He has a great bedside manner and is very kind and his staff is so friendly and helpful. Getting well takes a long time and he is so patient and willing to listen. We both love him and his staff. We travel 3 hours one way to see him and it is so worth it.  We will never go to any other pain doctor.

RJ Thomas|Steroid injection in the back. The first procedure did not work. in order for the insurance to pay for the next procedure, you have to lie and tell them that it was 80% effective when the second procedure didn't work encourage you that the third and fourth one will, but you have to continue to lie to get your insurance to pay for it. They make mistakes when setting up appointments and then act like it's your fault. The girl behind the front desk is horribly rude. As long as you're feeding their procedures then they encourage you to come back again again. I'm not sure if I should contact my insurance company and tell them about the insurance fraud or the state of Utah with their unethical practices . Either way I've got amazing insurance that pays for all this but these guys just don't care|Doctors and staff are very helpful and attentive. I feel like they actually listen to you and spend the time needed to explain something. They give you time to ask questions without feeling rushed. Very good bedside mannerisms and even in procedures they communicate what's happening or going to happen so you are aware of each step. The facility is very clean and well managed. Thank you for helping me with my chronic pain.|Dr. Rajiv Shah is a phenomenal doctor. He has helped our family including my parents for many, many years.

They were very thorough and made sure to do a full exam and x rays before any type of treatment to ensure they weren't doing more harm than good. After just the first adjustment, I felt so much relief and had more energy. Everyone is super nice. If you have the financial ability, definitely worth it.|This place is absolutely fantastic! My wife started working here administering the touch point injections. I came in to meet her coworkers and to see this amazing facility she had been telling me about. Upon entering the building, I was blown away by how clean and organized the flow of patients was set up.
I went to say hello to my wife but ended up having a lymphatic massage followed by a chiropractic adjustment by Dr. Jackson.
Before my adjustment, I was asked my medical history. I have had back surgery to fuse my lower back, so Dr. Jackson recommended some x-rays to ensure the adjustment wouldn't cause damage or hurt me.
After reviewing the x-rays, Dr. Jackson was able to adjust me and did such an amazing job. I had great movement throughout my entire body. Dr. Jackson's technique was soft but very affective.
Long story short, I'm scheduling an appointment for an overall wellness check and to create a care plan with Integrated pain specialist.
I can honestly say I'm excited to start feeling healthier/ better in mind and body due to the fantastic doctors, NP, and overall incredible staff this company has put together.|About two months ago I injured my neck and it was absolutely horrible. I started going to integrated and have been going there for the past six weeks, the knowledge they gave me about my neck and what we need to do to get it better was so eye opening. Most chiropractors are just adjust them and send them on their way, they way integrated does a detailed plan to not just give you temporarily relief but have a way to be forever pain free is amazing. Definitely would recommend to anyone|I have to admit, when I first came to Integrated Pain Specialists, I was skeptical. I didn't believe it would really help, but I was very pleasantly surprised. My back and neck are feeling so much better. After a week of coming, I had a better range of motion in my back. It was amazing! I have also been able to sit crisscross on the floor with my students. I didn't think I would be able to do that again, but I can and it's relatively comfortable.

Also, everyone at the clinic is kind, knowledgeable, sympathetic, and genuine. It's nice to come to a place where you actually feel like everyone is as invested in your health as you are. I would recommend Integrated Pain Specialists, in Bountiful to anyone.|When I came to Integrated I was having severe lower back pain.  They came together with a personalized plan just for me, focusing on not just getting me pain free but more flexible and mobile.  It has been a whole health approach, combining physical therapy with chiropractic work, and so many other things. The staff is amazing. They are friendly, they all take the time to get to know you, and have been committed to me seeing the results that I want. Overall they have exceeded my expectations. You aren't just a patient. They genuinely care about your wellness. I would highly recommend them to anyone!|In my constant quest for wellness, I stumbled into Integrated Wellness a few weeks back. My daughter recommended a chiropractor there. Dr. Jackson is one of the best I have ever worked with, and a most excellent replacement for the chiro that was keeping me going. They did comprehensive tests and recommended physical therapy in addition to the chiropractic I sought. The program I am on has returned me to feeling like myself, and we're only a third of the way through. In the words of one of the therapists, ""Don't come here! Unless you want results..."" They know their stuff, and use it to the patient's best advantage. Come here if you want to feel better!|Dr Jackson and his team have been beyond amazing! We took my daughter to several other Dr.'s and none of them could help us.

I'll give a background on why I give a five-star review. The clinic has been outstanding and I want to recognize that just give people my journey so that they know what to expect.

For those who want a TL:DR: Dr Obah and Mina are excellent, they will take plenty of time with you and your appointment to hear your concerns. If you need a full hour for a visit they will give you a full hour and you will never feel rushed to leave. Every member of the staff knows me by first name. I have no trouble reaching them by phone. When necessary, I've been be worked in for a same day procedure or exam. It has been done with friendly smiles. They leave nothing off the table, but are most concerned with getting to the root causes of your pain rather than simply wanting to prescribe you something and expect you to forget about the rest.

Most of this probably goes without saying but I will say: Be aware, it is not an huge franchise clinic. Do check in with the office. Sometimes they will have short days or some of the staff might not be available, so they might be closed or scheduled for a half day. I can only foresee this being problematic if you don't keep in communication with them.

Now, to go a little bit longer just to give more details for those who want them to see what my treatment has been like-

For over 20 years now I have dealt with chronic pain due to several injuries from sports and a life of hard work. I have nerve issues, a neck injury, lower back injuries, knee, shoulder and other injuries. For the last two decades I have had a few different clinic experiences as I've moved. I've experienced the full range of good, bad and middling doctors and clinics. This past year some chronic health problems, the state of my injuries, and my pain had gotten so bad that life was becoming impossible. I couldn't stand up straight to walk, sit for long periods, sleep, take care of myself, dress in the morning, or simply live a normal life.

Lifespring, Dr. Obah, Mina, the other assistance, receptionists and staff have all been fantastic. They've helped me get to a point where I can stand up straight and walk upright again, clean my house like a normal person, dress myself, and get back to working, studying and being a normal person again. I had stopped even being able to engage in social activities and was becoming a shut-in. Things are back to normal! I hope others can experience the same.|I'm writing to express my concern about the poor customer service at the clinic. While Dr. Obah is a great and caring doctor, the reception staff, medical assistant's  and clinic systems are inefficient. They often don't answer calls or return voicemails, and even go on holiday closure  without addressing patient concerns and returning calls. This  has significantly impacted my experience at the clinic.|I initially started seeing Dr. Obah, because I was trying to utilize injections to pin point my pain. 2018 crushed me in many ways, the trauma & pain made it difficult to regulate my emotions at times (crying ALOT ). I have been approaching things with a multidisciplinary approach. I have had years of PT, counseling, surgeries, etc. I switched to Dr. Robison after deciding I wasn't going to do injections anymore. I adore Dr. Obah & the time he spends with his patients, which was needed for me at the beginning, but seeing as he is so...busy & the only one that does injections I felt like transferring to a different doctor was fair so others can benefit from his compassion that I feel is rare. Recently I have gotten new pain & have been working with Robison & Obah getting injections again. Because these 2 Dr.s have helped manage most of my pain & been diligent in helping find a resolution, my emotional regulation has improved substantially, which has helped me to be able to advocate for my self. Dr. Robison has given me multiple suggestions after listening to me, those suggestions have worked wonderfully with my health plan. She is hands on & thoroughly tries to help find resolutions. I have had one hiccup with billing. Out of the many injections I have had here, only one I paid $50 for sedation, which later happened to be refunded fully to my lifesprings account. The balance started getting lower, and I was told it was co-pays but the balance didn't reflect that. I didn't realize this was happening & I called and confirmed balance was $50 previous to scheduling an injection that insurance wouldn't cover sedation, after they looked to see who I spoke with, it was detetmined this was a new employee that gave me inaccurate information. I showed up thinking I had a $50 credit ready to cover the cost of the needed sedation. I felt horrible that I was in this situation again. I realized that Dr. Robison & I had discussed 2 injections, insurance coveres the sedation for the other so I suggested we switch so the time wasn't wasted. I was thankful for the resolution. In the past when I was new I recall a miscommunication & ended up in the injection room being asked if I had paid for sedation. I was devastated because I didn't have the funds, I started to get ready to leave & they said they'd take care of it. Since then I have noticed needed policies have been implemented to avoid this happening again, pre-approval & informing which injections insurance covers sedation for. After thinking of all they have done for me I decided to leave it be, it evens out. I hope to continue with them as they help me on my journey to get back to the healthy lifestyle I desire.  I have loved all the nurses, I only had one unfortunate encounter with a nurse I never worked with, luckily I was in a good place, I was able to be compassionate myself & realize they must've been having a bad day just like everyone else does, and although it seemed aimed at me I knew I didn't do anything wrong so I didn't own it, instead I killed it with kindness. So thankful for these 6 years working with lifesprings.|I had been seeing Dr Oba for years, but as I make my medications last longer than prescribed it was hard to guess when I would need to come in next. I had been through a few different providers that had come and gone, but then I started with NP Stacey Robison. Not only is she invested in my pain and physical quality of life. I do miss Liz her now moved on nurse, but her current nurse is wonderful too b|My sister sees this clinic and referred me.
I had my one single apt over a year ago (feb 2023)!!!
I see a clinic in ogden and considered transferring and being seen at this location due to having my medical card and it would of been easier dealing with it all in one place. One dr.
The dr i requested to see isn't who I was scheduled with. The clinic isn't comfortable or welcoming. And clearly completely unorganized which is absolutely unsettling being incharge of such a critical part of people's livelihood.
The apt was uncomfortable and I immediately left and called the previous pain clinic and rescheduled with them.
I never filled a script. I never went back.
So nine months after my apt the office receptionist calls to ask all of my address information so she can send me the refund for the apt. That was in October of 2023. I have literally called and left 5-10 voice-mails. Spoke to different humans. Including specifically the billing female. And still have never relieved the ""refund"". Or even follow up at this point.
I cannot imagine letting this clinic be incharge of my pain management.
The unorganization is embarrassing and scary!|Compassion is the last word I would use to describe this place. They are concerned with getting your money, NOT patient care. I would highly recommend finding a different pain management clinic.|If I could give zero stars and let you know do not waste your time with this clinic. Read half of the reviews they all mean it. This place is judgemental and do not care about your pain and will make you wait 3 months just to tell you no you are not an adequate client here. Are you serious? So getting my arm cut off and being in miserable pain doesn't qualify me? this place needs to shut down.|My husband and I have been going here for 5 years.  Dr Stacy and Dr Obah are amazing.  That's only if u can get by the rudest scheduling person, Jenny, who has time after time hung up on us rather than transferring then accusing us of hanging up on her.  After 5 minutes of hold I did call back assuming I wasn't on hold any longer.  I then called back and when she answered I quickly told her I simply needed to be transferred to our amazing Medical Assistant, Lindsey.  Perhaps a little more customer service and respect training for the gal who has full control of the phone system.   Again amazing doctors terrible reception.

I've struggled with constant back pain for years and visited 4-5 different chiropractors, physical therapists, you name it. I never got better and sometimes I felt like the pain got worse. From the very beginning, I felt like Integrated does things completely different, and very much for the better. They make you feel like they truly care about helping you get better, and not just to treat the symptoms, but to actually get to the root of what is causing the problems. They explain everything to you so well throughout the whole process. Every person you encounter is so friendly and I genuinely enjoy spending time there. Who knew physical therapy could actually be fun? (Special shout-out to Price for making the PT portion the best part of the whole visit, which is usually NOT the case.)

I've been going 3x a week for about a month and have been wearing a brace and orthotics and as of this week, I have seen an 80% improvement. I can't even put into words how much this has already changed my life for the better. I can't possibly recommend them enough for anyone else who has been suffering from pain. Thank you all so much!|I am a former employee but also a patient. I ended up getting severe neck pain out of the blue from a muscle spasm and I called and team was quick to get me the treatment needed. They truly care about making sure you are taken care of. Sam is a fantastic PA and one of the only people I trust to inject. He is fantastic with his injections and knowledge when it comes to needing treatment. Learning from him and getting treatment from him has been exceptional throughout my time knowing him. The chiropractors are also just as great. I left with my neck way more improved having more movement than I did before the appointment because of the adjustment and injections. Kristina at the front desk and the Clinic Manager Wayne are also so good about making sure you get the treatment needed at the time you need it. Huge shoutout to Integrated!|Everyone from the doctors, to the aids, to the people working the desk, and the case managers are absolutely amazing. My appointments have become a highlight of my week. Not to mention the pain in my neck is  almost gone completely only halfway through my treatment plan! If you have persistent pain, you're doing yourself a disservice by not coming for a consultation.|I just finished my 12 week treatment and have made 76% improvement overall and significant increased mobility. The friendly faces and positive atmosphere always left me feeling 100% better than when I walked in the door. I highly recommend integrated pain specialists if you want to improve your life.|My experience at Integrated Pain Specialists has been TOP NOTCH!
From the initial review, to education, to treatment plan and implementation the team has been amazing!

For context: I was in a car crash prior to discovering IPS- and dealing with daily 8/10 pain that was causing me to miss work. I'm now 8 weeks into my 12 week treatment plan and I am happy to say that my pain is down to an average of 3/10.

The staff here makes you feel welcomed, and I seriously always look forward to coming!|After the first three weeks, it all  went downhill.  You are expected to come in and tote your chart around like a passport.  Otherwise, the chiropractor does not know what he is seeing you for and simply wants to ""crack your back.""   I was meant to have different treatments that I wasn't receiving because apparently, it's a self-serve facility.  You are expected to know you are responsible for asking for your care eventhough your paying them to care for you.  I had scheduled reoccuring appointments but couldn't get into get shots because I had to stand in line and wait around until I could weed my way in.  There were weeks that people were off, so no care was given nlthose weeks.  There is no backup person for injections.
I had appointments scheduled (reoccurring), and I would show up and be told that I wasn't scheduled because they forgot to schedule me out more.
I was also scheduled to have procedures done and needed a driver.  We scheduled time off work, and I have had those appointments both changed because Dr. Reed decided to ""not work on Tuesdays anymore.""  I had to reschedule a month later.  They set up two appointments, and Dr. Reed, yet again, was not available for one of them and got pushed out again.
Dr. Reed was doing a procedure on my back  and laughing at me because I was in pain.

Price their PT is amazing.  If they don't have 8 people occupying his area at the same time, he is great to work with and genuinely cares.  The issue is they herd people in there like cattle, and there is no room to do PT, but they definitely want to charge you for standing around.

Sam, their nurse who gives TP injections, is great as well.  Again, the  issues are he has no backup person when he takes time off, and you literally have to wait around in a crowd to get in to see him some days.

I've missed so much care that I should have had and am more pain now in my back than when I started.  My back and legs give out to where I collapse a few times a week.   I am so sad because I had high expectations for recovery and getting my life back.  

I am expecting a refund for the care not given AND something done to make it right.

A standard I'm sorry doesn't even come close to acceptable.  You all should know better than that.|Integrated pain specialists bas been the reason for my improvement! i have struggled with low back pain for 2 years and have seen significant results since coming here. The staff is wonderful as well!|I am so glad that I found these guys!! This is a one stop shop to address all of your needs with professional staff that really care.

Once she arrived it went smooth and efficient. They sent us home with a gas card once more apologizing for her late arrival. Also, the nurse placed the best IV I have ever had (and I have had a lot).|I recently visited Spinal Interventions at 270 River Park Dr in Provo, UT, and had a great experience. The check-in process was a bit lengthy, but the front desk staff handled it efficiently and with kindness, making sure all patients were cared for and informed. Their professionalism and welcoming demeanor set a positive tone for my visit.

The nursing staff was absolutely outstanding. They were thorough, attentive, and compassionate, ensuring that I felt comfortable and informed at every step. Their dedication to patient care was evident and truly appreciated.

Dr. Stringham was exceptional, taking the time to explain every aspect of the procedure in detail. He carefully walked me through what to expect both beforehand and during the procedure itself, which helped ease any anxiety I had. His ability to communicate complex information in a clear and reassuring way was remarkable.

Overall, I was very impressed by the level of care and professionalism I experienced at Spinal Interventions.

I love Dr Donaldson. She is fantastic. She is a TEN  doctor. But the PA Smith is a world class egotistical jerk. First off..people can hear every word you say while sitting in the room waiting. I heard what you said about me-someone you've never met. I HAD to change my appointment a day early because of my work schedule, NOT because I'm some doped up drug seeker. You do not belong in this type of medical field if you treat patients like this.

I've had several different injections during the last several years in my lower back with zero positive results. Spinal Interventions and Doctor Sanders have changed all that.

But having been in and out pain management for 15 years. I am happy for some of the protocols. After you go through it it becomes easier and easier month after month. My dr Travis diamond has a real sense for care. He is also patient and knowledgeable, h e answered all my wife's questions and concerns helped with; also understand a new condition and state I was in understanding the seriousness of it. Thanks an ton Travis I hope we can work together for many more year I appreciate your help!|My experience was wonderful. Everyone was very efficient and nice and Dr. Benfield is exceptional. He always prepared me for what was going to happen next, so there were no surprises and my appointment went perfect!|This is a great clinic. I've been working with them for a number of years now and they really have helped me with chronic pain that isn't going away, ever. Ive needed to learn to cope, exercise, learn and change many things as well minimize pain.

I've worked with a couple of different providers and they all treat me like a person, not just some chart number. Sir Travis Dimmond (lots of initials here}, Dr. Jeffrey CJ Bentley (lots of initials here too) are two providers who have taken care of me as if was their bestie or something.

They don't have a foot out of the door as soon as they walk into the room like many other physicians and practitioners do.  The others who assist are excellent as well! Tracy, Teresa, to name a couple who are awesome.

Anyway ... This is the place.

Update on 1/7/25
They are as good as they ever was

Update 1/8/25
I got a response from Intermountain after I gave the update. Just the pre programmed text.
I took the time to write a review.
I would appreciat it if you took the time to write a response.
I realize you're a big company, and perhaps many people are leaving responses every day. I am also positive that you have a very large PR team. So Even Steven.
Having a computer, send a thank you, is not a thank you.
Imagine getting the exact same computer-generated happy birthday email from your brother every year. While it was just pre programmed into his email system. And your brother just kept moving along on his path and didn't miss a beat.
Like that... downscale that by 99%, that's the example to make a point but on a lot less meaningful scale lol.

I still give this place FIVE STARS!
Doctor Bentley and Travis Dimmond are the two people I work with the most and I can't tell everybody how much I appreciate those two. They have helped me so much along my journey. They are the definition of medical professionals.

The front desk and scheduling staff are amazing too. I know a few of the names, and I really want to say thanks personally to each of those as well, but there's others I don't know their names and I don't want them to feel left out. So I won't leave names, and I will just say all of them are awesome.
It is true, you wouldn't think a front desk staff has that big of an influence on my health. They certainly do, in many ways! Sometimes I feel they have moved mountains on my behalf.
So thanks to them too. A good team like that probably doesn't get recognized enough but they have my thanks and appreciation.

Ok. Enough for today.|This is an amazing clinic.  Everyone is so so kind.  Rob Harkness is especially amazing, he is kind and takes the time to listen and actually help me manage my pain (without judgment) so that I can actually have a better quality of life.

He is compassionate, highly qualified; He meets or excells in the highest definition of competency as well in providing the highest standard of professional care, and support.

The pre procedural nurse was very instructive and Dr Hruska was caring and willing to answer all my questions.  She talked me thru every step and explained what I would be feeling.  It was so helpful.  I handled it very well because of her expertise.|Dr Tiemann was so great. He really listened and helped me understand what the problem was.

I've never met a Physician that has been so caring and took the time to explain my condition.  I felt so comfortable  and cared about .. also Konny's diagnosis was spot on even though I doubted it at first. .. I really don't write reviews but if anyone is considering pain management give them a try. I Guarantee you won't be disappointed !!|This was a beyond frustrating experience for my wife and myself. They gave a shot on the wrong side to my wife at first, and the nurse said she had done this before and apologized. The doctor ended up missing this as well. It's been well over a month, and my wife is still in pain on the side that never needed it. I approached numerous lawyers and DOPL and continuing to do so. I have called 6 times and left voicemails as well as walked in personally, and there are no responses from them to recommend something to help or at least apologize at the complete bare minimum.|Really good. Life changing for me. A surgeon referred me to have surgery, but I tried going here to get by for longer without it. After a series of visits my pain minimized each time and eventually was gone for 5 years - without surgery. I went back recently when it started to return and had an equally great experience and results. I see Dr Westin and PA, Konny.|I am writing this after only one visit, so it is only based on an initial consultation with Dr. Weston, also attended by Jared, who assisted with initial questions and in recording the discussion. Even though I have yet to receive treatment, I am writing now because some of the more recent reviews have been a bit salty toward Dr. W and the atmosphere of the office. I found Dr. Weston completely personable, bright, and articulate. He explained his interpretation of my MRI patiently. He took the time to answer all of my questions. I will be getting a second opinion, because a screwed up spine is serious stuff, to me. But Dr. W completely impressed me with his intellect and demeanor. He took my questions and concerns seriously, and I believe he is interested in helping me with my quality of life.Jared was awesome too, and seemed happy with the whole scene.  So that's cool. Peace.|The shot I received did nothing,  I was told they would give me 2 shots, my invoice said I received 2 shots,  one was supposed to be in the right side of my spine the other in the left,  they gave me both shots in the right side.  I then returned to talk about possibly getting a different procedure for my pain, and asked for a doctors note for my work for light duty, I basically have no disc left between L5 and S1 and the three above those are bulging and torn. They said it's not severe enough to get a note! I'm only 48, I'm not overweight or unhealthy.  My pain is so severe I can't sleep,  play with my children,  sit up out of bed, run or jump. And this is not severe enough to warrant a light duty note?  This place only wants your money. They don't care about individual circumstances or your well being, or health.  They also never answer the phone,  return emails, or phone calls.  Find someone else that actually cares about you and your individual medical needs.|I made an appointment for pain from a neck fusion. They didn't even let me speak to a doctor. The PA. ""Josh"" refused to help me with any pain medication and referred me to another doctor in their office. Another co-pay and more office visit. He did give me a prescription for Diclofenac without asking me if there was a history of heart issues. Being in my sixty's , I researched Diclofenac. There are many studies that claim this drug is related to and can cause heart attacks. This pain clinic appears to me to be just a money maker for the doctors. With no help for the patients. I will be looking for another clinic that has better educated staff. I recommend don't go here.
Also, The nurse assistant had a disgusting nose-ring. That was a definite clue  this office is not professional.|This place is pretty bad. The doctor started off the conversation by telling me he doesn't prescribe pain killers, even though I didn't ask. The said my neck warrants a surgery, but all they can do is give me an injection. They wouldn't even tell me what the injection was or how/if it would help me. Save your money and time and go somewhere else.|Prior to my appointment I read a ton of reviews for Dr. Stevens and was surprised at all the people who expected to meet with a surgeon and gain a friend. He didn't hug me when I walked in. He did, however, educate me on the extent of my back injury and what my options were. He took time to answer all of my questions in a kind and professional manner.  He was kind and respectful. I haven't had my procedure yet but expect that it will go well.

Edit:
I have since had the procedure and it has changed my life in the most positive way possible. I was walking directly after surgery, the next day I helped my Wife clean and felt the best that I have felt in a very long time. More importantly than bedside manner, which was good, Dr. Stevens is a world-class surgeon.

They are there to care for you!
Dr. Angela Krull is most remarkable.  She takes the time to get to know and understand you.
This is the place to go for expert compassionate care!
I am so grateful!|Both my husband and I are and have been treated by Dr Chen and Shane Green for almost 15 years. We love the care and compassion shown by each of them. They treat us like old friends each time we come in to see them. The integrity, coupled with an understanding for and nonjudgmental treatment of pain they display is rare in the medical community. If you need help with your pain management, then we recommend them to you whole heartedly.|From Rick J Nichols, Alta Pain Clinic  is the best Pain Clinic in the business. They are so kind, and compassionate and are  always on time with your visit. Shane does not concider himself as a Doctor but from what I read in his reviews all his patience do concider him as a Doctor. He is as knowlegable as a Doctor. They are by far the best. Dr Chinn is the best at giving injections and they really work. Thank You to all the staff at Alta Pain Physicians you guys are wonderful. Rick J Nichols

0912/2024 From Rick Nichols, I have had the priviliege of working with Jason for the last couple of months. Jason is wonderful to work with he is kind and compashionate and has great bedside manors during you visit. Also when you call and leave a message to talk to him he always returns your calls very quickly and as always the staff up front is very kind also. We are so thankful to have Alta Pain Physicans to take care of us. Thank You all so much for you help. I look forward to my visits with Alta Pain Physicans and Jason,  Sincerley Rick J Nichols|Very pleased with each visit I have, Dr Shane Green is amazing!!  He listens, he cares and understands with what you are dealing with. Very compassionate, overall he has been the best pain management doctor I have had, its very refreshing to find a doctor who cares and who does not just push pharmaceuticals. My mother sees him as well and feels the same.
Thank you to all of the staff, friendly and nice.
Teri and Carol...|The staff there is great, professional, and kind. My P.A. Jason listens to KY concerns and orders tests if needed.|I am so impressed with their office and providers! They did an ablation in my lower back never made me feel rushed or that they  couldn't take the time to answer my questions it was like a fresh of breath air. All the staff is very nice and pleasant. It is nice after experiencing medical care in Washington state (which is awful,  they just make you feel like a person in line and they have very limited time answer or explain  questions and you feel like it's more about them making money and seeing how many patients they can pump in and out) to feel like I found a pain management clinic that truly cares about me and wants to find a way to give me the best quality of life as I have a five year old so this is super important to me. You can't go wrong seeing any of the providers there. I just wanna say thank you so much to their office  and that I am so thankful for them and it's nice to see doctors being doctors morally and doing it because their truly care, you are in great hands there and I HIGHY recommend it to anyone suffering chronic pain!!!|I met with Shane Green today who is one the good guys in the industry who truly cares. I can see why Dr. Michael Chen hired Shane Green as his PA because they both share the passion for health and providing the best possible care for their valued patients. I've been seeing them for years to help me manage my severe chronic back pain after transferring pain management clinics after I felt like I was just a number and dollar sign to my last pain doctor. Since day one, Shane & Michael Chen and staff have actually listened to me, provided excellent professional care while treating me as a human along the way which is SO nice and rare. I recommend both Shane Green & Dr. Michael Chen without any reservations and I was not compensated in any way for leaving my honest review. Thank you guys!|If you are in need of a pain clinic this is the one! Shane Green and Dr. Chen are the best!

Overprescribing was such an issue the results have hurt so many. Unfortunately my doctor retired early because of all the headaches from being a caring, professional provider. Phusion Wellness is none of those things. They only care about $! They charge $250 per visit no matter of what your insurance covers. They have no doctors I'm aware of and at best a Physician Assistant will help you. They have you do a ""behavioral health"" appointment each month to help look like they've been proactive. It's trying to sell more services you don't need. You don't even get to be seen in office more than 1 every 6 months. The minimum requirement of the FDA. I failed a UA after all the years of not ever having any issues. I was told it corner from touching money or anything so simple. They only care about their $ and possibly getting in trouble for having that effect them. If you want a place that will prescribe to basically anyone as long as you follow all the rules and pay the bills this is the place. Katelyn is an unqualified person to have your life in her hands. She decided to kick me out of the program. Not my doctor, because I didn't even have one, but not even my physician assistant. She, not a medical professional, decided to kick me out of the program. I should have left there already. Looking for a new doctor is daunting. I know this happening is for the best. If you have true needs for pain management DON'T go here! If you're looking for the new face of ""pill mills"" this IS the place for you.|Phusion Wellness providers and staff are among the best in the business. They lead w empathy, compassion and truly care about their patients and their long term pain management. They provide many resources and forms of therapy to guide you to healing and maintaining your pain management over the long term. I would recommend if you're looking for a staff that truly cares and puts their patients first, reach out to Phusion Wellness, Greg is my provider, Michelle is amazing as well.|So very pleased with the level of care that I have received from Phusion Wellness Pain Clinic & Behavioral Health Specialists where I have been a patient for 3+ years.
This pain clinic is unlike any other clinic that I have experienced in my decades-long quest to manage chronic pain.
The staff demonstrates sincere care and compassion re: your well-being. They are far-more authentically-supportive than other clinics that I've dealt with throughout the past  20 years (namely while living in the Midwest), while attempting to manage chronic pain.
Truly, Phusion provides a world of positive difference in contrast to what I was used to dealing with in a pain clinic setting.
The clinic in Mesa, AZ. is phenomenal!
The doctors are wonderful and strive to help you achieve the highest level  'quality of life' possible for your particular health situation and needs.
The counselors are absolutely top-notch and provide excellent support for the patients in many capacities and utilize various therapeutic modalities.
The entire staff, (from schedulers to intake nurses), are friendly and efficient.
If you're in need of knowledgeable and caring pain specialists, give Phusion Wellness a try!
Kris B.|Phusion Wellness has been life changing. From my intake interview to present day the Staff are caring, understanding and I never feel judged for disabilities and need for more than being a pin cushion my previous providers. The addition of Behavioral Health Therapy monthly is invaluable. I am able to work again and function in society. Thank you to the entire staff.|Phusion Wellness has been a life saver for me. I never expected to be a chronic pain patient but due to a neurosurgeon destroying my cervical spine I do experience regular pain. Greg and Chad are fabulous and I love the consistency of setting up appointments. The behavioral workshops help so much because it helps me realize I am not alone.|I am pleased with my visit.

Dr. Child was my original practitioner, but then due to Ins.coverage  reasons I was encouraged to switch to Dr. Brent Egan... Both Doctors were nothing but respectful,  knowledgeable,  &  kind to me which is honestly a rarity sadly  when  it comes to Pain Management/ medication.  I whole heartedly appreciate their care, time & knowledge. Each visit is pretty quick and pleasant.  Thanks so very much to ya'll! You've helped make a stressful situation such as finding a new clinic after my old Doc was shut down literally randomly for no fault or reason of his own, which immediately/ abruptly left me "" high n dry""  a.k.a screwed  basically  due to "" rules about Dr. Shopping.   Which  is the MOST ludicrous  rule ever created especially when it comes to patients like myself that have literally no choice but to look for a doctor to relieve long-term/ forever treatment for Chronic Pain.  Anyways... point is I just genuinely appreciate being treated with respect and dignity! Thanks ya'll!!|The DR. And clinic were GREAT in all areas.  GREATE  JOB DR. EGAN.Thanks for the help|I have some pretty rare health issues that cause me tremendous pain. I have been under the care of a pain specialist since starting my journey to a diagnosis 10 years ago. Once my diagnosis was made my previous specialist did not bother to listen or care to learn about it or me. I was given a pill to shut me up for every issue I had. I was referred to Dr. Child by my best friend. I have never been more thankful to find this provider and his team. They are always, kind, professional and willing to go the extra mile for me and I am sure every single one of their patients. They have a multi step therapy plan to help you reach your best pain free goals. I am no longer just thrown pills and if I need an increase in something after doing procedures and therapy, I am never looked at or meant to feel like an addict because I am not. I never wanted to live my life in pain, I never wanted to need to be medicated but I am glad that Dr. Child and his staff are empathetic and understand that sometimes it is necessary for people who suffer from debilitating pain day in and day out. His bedside manner is next to nothing that I have ever seen and I am lucky to have many top specialist over my care and his is top of the top. Do not hesitate to come and see Dr. Child because I have no doubt that he will do what is right and necessary for your individual needs. I am so lucky to have found him, I just wish it was sooner.|I have been a patient of Dr Egans for about 4 years. I thought he was a wonderful Dr until today. My appointment was at 8:30 this morning, it came and went. I didn't receive a phone call or text nothing. After I called repeatedly they finally called me back. I am Extremely Disappointed in how they handled this situation. I really love all the ladies in the office, I will miss them. But the Doc, I expected more from him.  I thought he was a great Doctor and actually cared about his patients but in truth it's all about the money.  Sad but true!!|I've never seen them, because they demanded ""proof"" I have chronic pain. They asked for a doctor's referral, which I provided. Then they said that's not enough. When asked what I should provide that would be enough, they would not tell me. I hope they help people, because they sure didn't help me. Very rude and unhelpful.|I am always greeted warmly by the front desk.  Brent Egan is a truly kind person who honestly cares about his patients.   He always takes the time to go over anything you need him to.  He explains things to make sure you understand.  I'm so happy I found him.|Forced to wait 45 minutes for an appointment.
They are unprofessional - disorganized and rude.
I walked out after waiting and being told they can't do injections where I needed them.",2024-10-21|2024-05-11|2025-02-10|2022-01-19|2021-03-10|2024-07-11|2022-12-07|2024-08-05,5|5|5|5|1|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJp_XUBC6AUocRNcX3qC3NizM,48
