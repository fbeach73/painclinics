As soon as explained my situation to the doctor, he knew right away. I was in pain and I needed help. He has assessed me and he has given me two rounds of steroids and he is continuing to treat me to help heal me the best that we can, this doctor is the only doctor that has ever taken the time to actually listen to me and believe me on all the pain that I'm in I recommend dr gungor 100%|I am grateful that Dr. Gungor was referred to me. From the first moment of meeting him I felt at ease because he took his time to ask the right questions, to listen, to evaluate and provide sound recommendations. He transcribed the information accurately in my chart which told me was really listening. Nothing got lost in translation. He won my confidence.  He has an excellent administrative staff in Eladia and Lillian who are timely, prompt and professional. A pleasure to work with. My experience at HSS with Dr. Gungor and the team who took care of me was a model of dignified care from the first moment of entering the unit until I left. Dr. Gungor's expertise during the procedure and his nurse Maricris Anic were really a star team against the backdrop of beautiful Latin music! I don't know every name but Gina and Deborah and everyone who touched my care including Jordan the nurse who called me the next day makes this a ten star  experience.|Where do I begin?  After finding Dr. Gungor, your search will have ended.  I have never met a more compassionate, caring, knowledgeable doctor for pain management.  My journey with Dr. Gungor began in 2013 when I had a pain that wrapped around from my back, on my side to my abdomen.  I was misdiagnosed by numerous doctors for about 3 months.  Dr. Gungor realized it was an ""intercostal nerve"" that was causing my pain.  I had an RFD (Radio-Frequency Denervation) and the pain has NEVER returned.  I have been treated by Dr. Gungor since then for different nerve pain, back pain and neck pain from a spine surgery I had in 2010.  His experience as an Anesthesiologist before he decided to focus mainly on pain management, is legendary.  One of the levels of my spine surgery did not fuse, but Dr. Gungor has kept me more than manageable with some neck and nerve pain instead of me agreeing to have another surgery about 2 years after the first one.  Dr. Gungor walks you through every option and procedure and literally holds your hand and makes sure you are comfortable before and during any procedure I have with him, and it has been many from RFD's, epidurals, facet joint injections and trigger injections.  Dr. Gungor's expertise is extraordinary and his bedside manner is off the charts, even to the point of him remembering everything I tell him about my family.  He always asks how they are doing as well.  I'm happy that one of the other doctors at HSS in the pain management department sent me to Dr. Gungor.   I am grateful to have Dr. Gungor guiding me on a pain-free journey!!|I have been a patient of Dr Gungor for 15 years. HSS as well as Dr Gungor truly stand out. The care and warmth displayed by everyone is undeniably the best you can ever ask for.|Dr. Gungor is an amazing doctor who deeply cares about his patients.  I've been seeing him for almost 15 years ago for neck and back injuries I received while serving overseas for the US government.  He has always taken the time to discuss my treatment options and helped me manage the pain so that I can continue serving abroad at the highest levels.  I'm so thankful for Dr. Gungor and greatly appreciate his professionalism and expertise.|If I could add stars to rate the level of consistent, quality care I've received since finding Dr. Gungor, I would gladly do so.
It's comforting to have a physician on my Care team that doesn't waiver when it comes to listening  to my concerns.  Further, Dr. Gungor addresses  each one with viable recommendations for treatment, and transparency about the potential outcomes. He is top notch, always balancing care and empathy, that puts me at ease, with my condition.
During every encounter with Dr. Gungor, and his staff, I feel ""heard"" as a patient.  The professionalism is unwavering and commendable. This is almost a rarity in most health care settings lately.
I would, without any reservation, recommend Dr. Gungor to anyone in need of an experienced, competent and compassionate pain expert.  He remains current with treatment options, consults as needed, with other members of a care team, and always puts the patient - first!|I have been a patient of Dr. Gungor for many years. During this time he has explored numerous procedures to ease my pain. Due to the excellent and innovative quality of his care, I am able to function very well. His approach is kind and attentive. He is supported by an equally committed staff.|I am a patient of Dr. Gungor for over 10 years and has address all my needs associated with my back and and neck pain. Dr. Gungor is by far the best Dr. I regularly see. He truly cares about my pain and listen to what I say about how I am feeling. Never rushes through my appointment and completely understanding not only my pain, but the anxiety and personal issues having chronic pain places on my mental health. He focuses on controlling my pain needs with all the newest technologies. When conducting a procedure he always makes sure I am not in pain or experiencing any unnecessary anxiety. I would highly recommend any person dealing with pain make an appointment with Dr. Gungor.",2024-04-16|2023-11-14|2022-09-15|2024-07-16|2020-12-14|2022-09-16|2022-09-21|2022-09-29,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Appointments recommended",,,advanced_treatment_options|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJOfcfqsZYwokRfB71sCbVZ2M,20

Sinai / Beth Israel Pain and Palliative Care Center was almost as good as the one I'm being treated at now with one major difference... location and parking.
Navigating to this location has always been a challenge, regardless of transportation. Whether driving or using public transit, I consistently faced delays and missed appointments due to the unpredictable travel times. These 50-60 minute trips often took 2-3 hours, significantly impacting my punctuality.

My doctor, Dr. Benjamin H. Natelson, has been incredibly understanding of my condition, which causes cognitive difficulties. He consistently accommodated my challenges, patiently waiting or rescheduling appointments. His support extended beyond simply waiting - he provided detailed, step-by-step directions over the phone and even personally escorted me to the correct subway entrance.

Dr. Natelson's dedication has been invaluable. I've been his patient since 1994, following him from UMDNJ in Newark to Mt. Sinai Beth Israel and now to their uptown location. This new location offers significantly improved accessibility, regardless of transportation method.

The availability of valet parking at Mt. Sinai is a major relief, eliminating the stress of finding parking and further minimizing the risk of late arrivals. This is especially beneficial after a long drive without any unforeseen delays.|The worst hospital ever. I schedule an appointment for pelvic ultrasound.I asked in advance how long is the wait time and was told there are 4 technicians so it will only take 15 minutes I also was told to come ""ready"" meaning with fool bladder. I had 8 glasses of water and was put on hold for an hour. When I said I CANT WAIT any longer I was told that it is my problem, they have 4 more people before me and cant do anything but I am welcome to complain. When I asked for a manager I was told  she/he is not available, so I left. Not only I had to take an extended lunch and didn't accomplish anything  and had to commute when its 95 F outside taking subway underground in this heat and spending $5 for nothing but waiting more than an hour after having 8 glasses of water was a torture!

They ask the right question ?  They also listen very carefully. They don't give medications which I love but they do give you an injection to relieve your pain they send you to physical therapy. I just wish that there was a chiropractor in that office but I was in there I love the reception girls and all the doctors there

When I questioned the staff about my need for help, they apologized and said that they didn't really know what to do because it is not a situation they handle often.

When I reach out to the front staff, they never seem to understand what I need although I've spoken to the same person (Diandra) numerous times. She is continuously unprofessional and lacks any empathy towards my situation always placing blame on the doctor, other departments and insurance carrier. It seems the manager's never available. Unfortunately, the one person(Laryssa) that seems to know what is going on is in the billing department and so swapped with other cases that she forgets what our conversations entailed when I call to follow up.

I came to him with lower back pain. He took his time to clearly explain my problem, the possible courses of treatment, and benefits/risks of choosing different approaches. He answered all my questions thoroughly and thoughtfully, with a great deal of respect for patient autonomy and input. Even though I ultimately needed surgery to address my problem, Dr Waldman gave it his all to solve my problem with the tools he has as a physiatrist. I highly recommend him for his diagnostic skills and his technical expertise.|I came to see Dr. Waldman from NJ after I started having right sided lower back pain. Dr. Walkman knew that my significant other and I are medical professionals and he still sat with us for over 30 minutes to explain the details of the entire MRI while showing us exactly what he saw and what his concerns were. He was exceptionally thorough and professional. He offered me options for treatment and considered my goals for rehabilitation. His fellow was also very thorough, friendly, and professional.|One epidural reduced my back pain by 90%.

He doesn't prescribe narcotics routinely, if that's what you're looking for as a bandaid for your pain. He takes a detailed history, listens intently to what his patients have to say, orders the appropriate tests, shows you the results and discusses at length treatment options. If something doesn't work, he has a back up plan. He doesn't rush into surgery either, unless all options are exhausted. He's a gentle and caring soul who clearly has devoted his life to making back pain more manageable. I've been seeing him for over three years and have a very complex case and I recommend him highly.|I don't have enough words to describe how happy I am after I met Dr Seth Waldman.  I had 2 other Pain Mgmt Drs before him and was very disappointed.  I travel every month to see him to NYC and it worth it since no other Dr like him.  He spends as much time as I need to answer all my questions, to explain all I need to know and always finds words of encouragement.  Not easy to have a patient who survived 2 serious spinal fusions, struggles with pain 24/7 and has many complications and nerve damages.  But in 6 years I never heard from him ""Nothing can be done"", he always finds a solution to help me and I am very grateful for that.

I found VIP and decide to give it a try, and much to my disappointment he treatment did not work, it actually made my veins much worse then they were..

Not only did I developed new varicose veins within months of
My treatment, the veins I wanted treated got worse. I also developed more spider veins all over my legs.
My legs look much worse than they did before .

I did check with my primary care Physician and they referred me to a Vascular surgeon. The surgeon told
Me the veins that needed to be treated are not treated correctly.

I did reach out to VIP to let them know my disappointment and hoping to give them a chance to rectify the situation, I was told
I would be contacted back but I never heard back from them.

I know VIP has treated many patients successfully but for me that was not the case, I highly recommend if you have a bad varicose veins seeing a Vascular surgeon may be your best bet..

I found her to be extremely thorough; she listened very well; she was very friendly and down to earth; and she  outlined several different options for my treatment plan. I liked that she wasn't pushy about any of them and allowed me to be able to participate in my care too. I felt the direction she going with me was reasonable, regardless of the particular path we choose.

The nurse, Brittney, was equally as thorough and friendly as my provider, and so were the receptionists. I felt very comfortable at this office, and I felt like a person to my provider, the nurse and the receptionist.

As for the clinic, itself, parking was adequate and easily accessible. The clinic is Lin a convenient location. Inside, the reception area was neat and clean, although the chairs in the waiting area could've been a bit more comfortable, but the wait time was very brief, so it wasn't really that big of a deal. The rest room was also very neat and clean, as well as the patient rooms.

Overall, the first visit left a very good impression and I'd highly recommend this clinic and this provider.|Alison Thomas is very compassionate and kind. Of the many kinds of physicians I have dealt with, she and her clinic actually listen and is very supportive and understanding of my many physical issues and needs. I'm always greeted with a smile, concern, and patience. I feel that I am heard, I am truly cared for. I hate the way I feel regarding my condition , but their approach and their care bring a ray of sunshine to my day. I have never left there feeling that they were not in my corner. I see Allison, Alissa, Dr McCall , and they are always professional and honest and they always seem to be happy. I cannot say anything but positive about Eastern Regional Pain Clinic in Goldsboro, NC and their staff.|Friendly staff and they always make sure that I have what I need! The wait time is always short usually not more than 15 minutes! They listen to what I have going on and do their best to help me have a better quality of life! I am very satisfied with this medical profession!|Physician's, PA, nurses and staff have all been great to work with, especially Allison.  She takes the time to listen, explain and address any concerns or issues.  A true professional.  Highly recommend them if you need top notch care!|Allison was very professional and caring. She was very pleased with the response and relief of pain I received from my injection. I am totally pleased with this practice and all staff.|Absolutely wonderful. I felt like y'all really want to help and I felt like you were happy to help me. Michelle is the best!! She was very personal and professional!!! I will not go anywhere else with my issue....|I have to say Michelle Fleck, FNP is an amazing individual.  Not only does she listen to my concerns and feelings she hears what you say. There is never a rush to get you out. Greatly satisfied with my experience here. Would recommend to anyone experiencing pain and discomfort. Five Stars!!!!|Allison Thomas NP is awesome!!! I've been going to other pain clinics for probably 10 years now and she is the first provider that I feel really listened to me. After only 2 months, we have a treatment plan that has been successful. Not only is she a good NP , she's one of the nicest and sweetest people you'll ever meet.

Had to give a urine sample with a nurse present in the bathroom and fill out so many papers. Briefed on what not to do with medicine, and I never received anything. I didn't know what to even expect,I had never been to anything like this. My records were never sent, had to take another trip for X-rays, then return two more weeks later, had a came at the wrong time, they would not see me even tho they were empty and I drove 45 mins to get there, said I was a walk in first time, I'm pretty sure the insurance was billed for the previous visit. I felt like there was not much empathy towards pain, or a goal of me feeling better. I've been in pain for three years now, and feel like  no where I go is serious about helping or cares genuinely. I'm out of heart with the whole matter. These doctors don't realize what a impact thier spirit has on people who are already desperate. But the staff in the office was great. I'm gonna have to leave my ruptured disc and arthritis and growing poverty to God.|The doctors there are very thorough and helpful.

Everyone there treats you with respect and true concerns for your well being. I would highly recommend the Pain Clinic of North Carolina. Great Doctor's. I see Jamie and think the world of her.

I was under the impression that it was a place for drug abuse and that I would be treated as an abuser, even though I had just begun my treatment. I was so wrong !! I saw a very friendly staff, a very understanding staff and not once was I treated with less respect or less dignity than any other Clinic I've been to, Eye, Dental, Ear etc..
My impression was so off base, I hope anyone who needs help with medication after an injury or surgery understands the importance of the Clinic. Your health care is important and this process is not to shame anyone who takes pain medication, it's to control the quantity of medication that not only you might be able to achieve but to also control the influx of medication that does hit the streets.

She cares about my well being, not just my pain but my life! She asks questions to make sure that I feel safe in my living environment and if I need help with food insecurities!! She is very professional, but very caring at the same time. I highly recommend her especially if you are at an advanced age, like myself!!!|I have had the worst experience in my life dealing with this place. I went in to get help with my health issues willing to do what was asked of me to receive the help that I needed. They asked me to do physical therapy and I asked if they could fill out paperwork for me for my job in order for me to be able to go and keep my job. I was told sure no problem. I was thinking great but boy was I wrong. My first and only visit was in September I called every week several times each week reminding them that the paperwork needed to be sent back it had a deadline. I asked if they would fax the documents they said they didn't have a fax so it had to be picked up. When finally got word back from my job I found out that they didn't allow me enough time off for my situation and I gave them more paperwork to fix that one thing and they went right back to holding on to the paperwork it went past the deadline and when I finally received word from my job this time they left the time allowed away from work blank. Funny thing where they didn't have a fax machine before I found out that they fax the paperwork. Listen if you decide to go ahead and go to this facility in Winston Salem I would hope that you received better care than I did. The doctor was Christopher Gilmore and his nurse Maria. She was very rude he seemed nice but obvious didn't care because at the end of the day I called and left messages never got a call back so this my warning to you go and  see someone else.|Would not recommend this place. They did NOT ask for my co-pay when I would check in, which resulted in building a bill that I couldn't pay all together at once, so I wasn't ""allowed"" to be seen until paid. I've had 7 back surgeries and paralyzed twice. I'm in excruciating pain everyday all day. Office staff up front have bad attitudes all the time. The nurses also have bad attitudes and are very judgmental. The doctors nor PA's did not help me in the time I was there, prescribing medication I've taken before multiple times and told them it didn't help. Suggested a surgery I've been told no by other doctors about many times. When I would send a message through Mychart NONE were answered.|Dr North , Lena Ferris, FNP-C Tammy Burke FNP-C

So they have left me with nothing for the pain. And I used to take oxycodone 5mg 4x a day so now I have nothing to take for my severe pain. And I've ended up in the er because im in so much pain.

Some reviews say he is dismissive- in my case this is not true at all, he listened to my struggles, is very knowledgeable, has excellent bedside manner and most of all he actually cares enough to help manage my pain. I got my first injections today, and am hopeful for recovery now. I can't thank him enough for helping me. The staff is also wonderful!|Dr.Ward is the best doctor I've ever seen in my life, explained everything in detail, and ordered multiple tests that no other doctors would!

Appointment was at 10:20, got there at 9:52, was told to hold on a minute, checked in at 9:58 then was told I was not there 30 minutes early so would have to reschedule my appointment. When I told her I was there at 9:52, she said i checked you in at 9:58, you're late. I saved money and also decided who not to see. Can't imagine how little attention they would actually give to my case. If you do go, take a picture of the time you stand at the desk. They will make you wait then you'll be late.|Not to happy with the current change up with the staff, and unfamiliar faces that are now there!.. But Dr. Jessica Salmon, is wonderful!!

Closed at 3:00 today. I literally drove here to do this.  It would be nice if someone would return my voicemail or answer the phones. Not a good way to run a business
Updated: They called me on Monday and apologized about the situation.  They also updated the open times on Google as well.

I was unfortunately involved in a car accident. My wife ask some friends for recommendations and the pain and laser center came highly recommended. I also visited my primary care the day after the accident and they also recommended pain and laser center. I had never been to a chiropractor. My primary care called and they opened a spot for me to come the same day. I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first but after a few visits and adjustments I am now a believer. I have made steady progress over the past 3 weeks. The treatments are great. This office has a very nice, modern, clean and relaxing atmosphere. The professional staff is wonderfully positive. I highly recommend this place of business if you have been in an accident or maybe have issues with pain in your back. Special thanks to Dr. Stafford.|Dr. Williams is an amazing Chiropractor as he is a person.  Every single visit has been very welcoming, pleasant, and beneficial.  The entire staff is equally amazing.  I look forward to seeing everyone and having my treatment sessions.  In a world where kindness, consideration and smiles seem to be less...you are guaranteed all three and more when you visit.  Thank you Dr. Williams, Dr. Evans, Ashley, Aileen, Melanie, Kelly and Jesse!!!!!!!!|Friendly and knowledgeable staff - Aileen the laser technician is wonderful as is Dr. Williams.  I came here in September with debilitating pain from an existing condition worsened by a slip and fall.  The treatment plan designed for me has effectively, and happily, got me back to 100%. I highly recommend this center!|Great Place!!! Friendly and caring staff.  Was having disk pain that was impacting my nerves and legs.  Aileen does a great job applying the laser treatments. Started receiving treatments with the last two weeks and the majority of the pain is gone.|I had some serious pain issues after I herniated a disk while working out a few months ago. On top of the normal back pain that comes with a herniated disk, I also developed a sciatic issue that would run down the left side of my leg that at times, was even more painful.  I met with Dr. Evans and she recommended laser therapy along with rehab and adjustments. I noticed the laser therapy really helped my back, especially my sciatic nerve. It really calmed the nerve down and gave me some much-needed pain relief. If you are active and need some help with you back pain, I would recommend to anyone that they speak with Dr. Evans.|PAIN AND LASER CENTER in Greensboro N.C. on West Market Street is an awesome place for any type of pain. The people that work there are professional, nice, and gentle.  The office is very organized and ran very professional. Each person that comes there is important to all the staff and the Doctors.

I arrived 30 mins prior as told to by them. Instead I waited 2 hrs and 30 mins in waiting room, to see dr for 10 mins tops an told my condition is minor. Totally disregarded by dr that my medications worked for me an cut me off all medications to be put on basically one medication, an put on a medication I can't take. Then basically rushed out cayse it was 5 pm. The staff was rude, the front desk gave dirty looks, an never a smile. Were on cellphones. Now one tech ms. A. Garcia was kind an understanding of me being a parents whose husband is deployed. An apologized for the wait. I asked my pcp to be sent somewhere else.|I made an appt for 12/18. I needed to reschedule it for 2025. Called a week before my appt and left a message to reached. No one got back to me. Just called today 12/17 to confirm that appt was cx and to resched. I got a foreign operator who said they were gonna transfer me to the right department, waited over 20 mins for a person to pick up only for them to tell me to pick option 1 and transferred me back into the queue WHILE I was still SPEAKING TO THEM. Needless to say I will not be calling a third time.|I had horrible experiences at the Fayetteville location. The front desk and nurses are rude, uncaring and disrespectful. The only person who I felt was caring was the Nurse Practioner or PA. (She was not a doctor. She was pregnant the last time I saw her but unfortunately I can't remember her name.) My last visit was in July 2024. They had just moved to a new location. I was put into a large room with a GURNEY, 1 chair and a tiny table for the doctor to put his computer on. He wanted to see my lower back so he lowered my pants while I stood in the middle of the room since there was no exam table for me to even lean on. It felt odd and uncomfortable. I was in excruciating pain. I asked for a shot of Toradol to calm the pain down. The doctor refused. (I am not on any controlled substances so I was not trying  to get any ""drugs"". Toradol is not a controlled substance and works great for easing my pain temporarily.) The doctor checked me over and said ""I'll be right back"". I waited for a long time thinking he had a Eureka moment but he never came back! However, he did order an MRI. Since I knew I was NEVER stepping foot in that place again, I made sure my MRI results were sent to me and my Primary Care physician. Something showed up on the MRI that was unrelated to my spine. My PC called me the very next day and told me I had to go to another doctor to have the findings checked out immediately! Wake Spine and Pain never called me about the results. Thank God I had my results sent to my PC or I would not have had this concerning condition taken care of ASAP.  Weeks or possibly months later, I did get an unintelligible voice message from Wake Spine and Pain about rescheduling a follow-up appointment. Since my last visit with this disrespectful,  uncaring practice,  I have found a NEW clinic where I am treated with dignity and respect. For years, I put up with the hatefulness at Wake Spine and Pain because I thought it was the only pain clinic in Fayetteville. Due to my work schedule  I did not want to go to travel long distances. I just want people to know there is another option in the Fayetteville area!|I've been attending Wake Spine and Pain for a couple of years now and I have to say hands down I love the atmosphere, the staff members and especially my NP Tamesha Kamconteh. She is the best. Very empathetic, understanding, passionate and listens to her patients and gives the best service hands down. Thank You Mrs Kamconteh.|I saw PA Tameka. Wasn't a pleasant experience. Going to a new dr or PA is always stressful but it was much more. On my 1st visit, I asked if she would able to write my meds & if a nerve stimulator implant for my back would be helpful. A yr ago I decided to quit taking narcotics as they weren't doing much good. I told them when I made the appt I was NOT looking for medication other than my Lyrica. No problem. The 2nd visit was off the rails! She was short & disinterested in what I had to say. She reminded me of the tests she ordered the 1st visit. She went to check on something then sent another nurse in with the name of another clinic, telling me Ms Tameka said I was an ""addict"" & that was the name of a detox center. Say what? I asked to see Ms T but the nurse pointed her finger at the door & told me I needed to leave. I was flabbergasted! The only rx I asked abt was changing me back to my original muscle relaxer. So that makes me an addict? OK. But I'm a happy addict then. Lolol
Addicted to sobriety!!|I hate to post this as I was excited to see a doc. This post was my initial appt experience. I checked in early and completed my paperwork earlier in day since was coming from fort liberty. I arrive for my appt time but was told I was ""supposed to come 30 minutes before my appt"" time and i had to be rescheduled"" was somone going to tell me that? The text doesn't say that. I declined and will not return.|The office staff at the front desk are rude and short with patients. Wait time is excessively long. You will be waiting over an hour after appointment times. Doctors do not inform you of your results in a timely manner. I have been inquiring about my results for a while and had to call back while awaiting a follow up appointment. Phone hold times are also extremely lone. While waiting in an exam room no one comes to tell you anything they just let you wait and hour or so over your appointment time.
The only staff member who pulled me in on time and explained my x-rays was Princy Paul. She was the only reason I didn't pull out but now I am having second thoughts about this establishment.

The office is spotless and always has some kind of decoration up for the upcoming holiday. The dr's and all the staff seem to be very knowledgeable about what is going on and willing to help in anyway possible. I will definitely go back if needed.|I don't want to put anything out there just yet because I only went in before my first appointment last week. Dr Todd was very thorough and put me in a different direction than I went in there for which made a lot of sense to me. After seeing a few other doctors for a couple other things before this appointment I would give this doctor an 11 since those other doctors would get negatives and some. It's bedside manners were so I guess I wasn't used to being treated so nicely and being able to go over things in detail and not rushing me out the door like the others.So with that being said, I will do another review after I go back to my second appointment after my MRI and that may turn everything in a total different direction possibly. We shall see.|Very responsive! Dr. Lewis and his assistant are very kind. Talked me through my injection. Very personable answered all my questions and to beat it all no more pain in my shoulder.

Changing their phone number.  2. Not answering their phone.  3.Screwing up your appointment.  4. 2 months out for another appointment.  5. Saying they don't have your imaging when you show up for that appointment so they can't see you then.  6. Not being bothered to call and inform you of the lack of imaging in the 2 months prior.   THIS PLACE IS NOT MUCH ABOVE A SCAM. Call me livid!!!|For the second time in as many months, Comprehensive Pain Consultants HAS DROPPED THE BALL. Customer service is absolutely horrible.

I saw Dr. Knab and his team, they were extremely informative and personable. Dr. Knab was able to correctly identify the issue and provide treatment. I was positively blown away by the great care I received from the staff. I highly recommend this practice!|Very positive experience today. Respectful, gentle and very knowledgeable team. I'm looking forward to continuing care with them. First time in a while that I was treated like a real person. Thanks so much.

A follow up: four months, 3 procedures, both doctors and only temporary relief. Finally I was seen at a follow up by a PA I had not met. She informed me that I was 72, my back is in bad shape and they can't help me anymore. It's the first time I've ever been rejected by a medical practice and I didn't even see a doctor in the end! Medicine is the only service that demands payment even when the treatment fails. Draw your own conclusion.|Recommend Dr. Arora and this practice to all needing pain management care. You will be in the best expert, kind, and compassionate hands working with this practice and I am so grateful for being able to be their patient!! Recently had first lumbar sympathetic nerve block injection with Dr. Arora and was so nervous beforehand but he and his staff talked me through it with kindness and patience. I cried tears of joy at the relief this injection gave me! Highly recommend!!!|My first visit was 6 weeks ago. I have had back pain and leg pain off and on for 6 years which affected my leg all the way down to my ankle. In the past six years I had visited three other pain clinics in town and this was my last stop. When asked my level of pain it was 7.5.Sitting for more than 5 minutes was extremely uncomfortable in any chair including car seats. Driving, aggravated the pain immensely. Since I didn't have a current MRI, the staff sent me immediately for a current one. At my follow-up visit for the MRI, I was told that I have a thicken ligament at L4/L5. The staff  showed me my MRI in detail taking time to explain what they were showing me. I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered a procedure that would alleviate my pain. I was handed a brochure for a procedure called the M.I.L.D procedure. The staff explain this procedure to me and advised me to research it as well. I found what they explained to me was correct and it is a minimally invasive procedure. I accepted the surgery and it was done in a very timely manner. Three days after the surgery, I am pain free in my back and leg and I couldn't be more happy. The staff at the clinic are truly dedicated to helping people reduce their pain as much as possible with today's technology. I hope I don't need to visit this clinic again but it is very comforting to know that if I have any body pain in the future I have a clinic that offers me tried and true options with expertise. Thank you to all the clinical staff for your professionalism, expertise and above all caring enough not to rush me out the door and explain worth while options.|Dr. Knab and his staff are very personable, attentive and take the time to listen to your concerns.   Highly recommended!|Today was my first visit , everyone was super nice, professional and very informative. Dr Arora was wonderful, he took his time to explain everything and listened to all
of my concerns . I look forward to being treated by them in the future.|Dr. Sunil k. Arora messed up my spinal injection and when I confronted him he denied it. Now I'm in severe spinal and leg pain. I have reported him to the medical board and filing a medical malpractice lawsuit. Please DO NOT get a back injection or any injections from him. He does not take accountability for his actions. Only gets defensive. And his nurses will back him because they don't want to be out of a damn job. It's sad and pathetic that he messed up someone's life and not admitting to it.|I came across the Center For Pain Management when I started looking for PRP injections. I am 28 and have torn my bicep tendon 4 times now in the past 7 years. The surgeon wanted to try cortisone before surgery but after doing my research found that cortisone is short term and often creates more issues, especially when surgery is needed. Dr. Knab and his team were awesome, very helpful and very affordable. It has been six months since my PRP injections and while I still need surgery, the progress I have made is still pretty incredible. Before the PRP I couldn't even walk without my arm in a sling and now I can lift weights and do light swimming. Unfortunately my injury is pretty severe since It's happened so many times, so I will still need the surgery. But the improvements I made were legitimate and I would highly recommend seeking them out for alternative healing methods.

The Dr (Shah) assured me that I would receive a call verifying insurance approval and a date scheduled for surgery to install a spinal cord stimulator. 2 weeks before Christmas I called to get the status and both times I got a answering machine message that someone from the office would return call within 2 days promise. Both times no one ever  returned my call. Here it is January 7, 2025 and still no call back or anyone calling me about insurance approval / disapproval.

I feel disappointed because I have followed all the rules|My wife has been battling chronic pain for almost 3 years, and was referred to half a dozen different specialists before we found Dr. Shah. After reviewing all of the prior imaging and tests he took us through a series of progressively more intense treatments until we found one that works. My wife finally had her first pain-free days in years thanks to Dr. Shah.

I'm puzzled by the reviews saying that the staff are hard to reach. We've gotten the voice menu and left messages on occasion but that's been the exception for us, and when we do leave a message we've always gotten a prompt callback. Their insurance  team did all the heavy lifting for us with pre-approvals and, in the latest case, a successful insurance appeal.

It is no exaggeration to say that finding Dr. Shah was life-changing for us. I just wish we'd found him sooner.|I don't recommend the Carolinas pain center. I went there for my knees.

My husband had been prescribed pain medication in the past, and after two recent surgeries, he was referred to Midtown Pain and Spine for pain management services. In his first appointment with Heather Allen, NP, she informed him she would not be prescribing pain medication at that appointment. In fact, it was their policy not to prescribe for the first two weeks as he would need to provide a urine sample for drug screening. We found it highly unusual that a pain clinic made patients wait two weeks for a turnaround on the drug testing. Heather offered him a lidocaine patch and some gel, both of which could be purchased over the counter. It was a wasted appointment. Wouldn't it be reasonable for the clinic to share their two-week policy up front with new patients? My husband literally grit his teeth for two weeks, waiting for his second appointment. When we arrived, Heather told us they did not receive his urinalysis back yet; therefore, she would not be prescribing any pain medication for him. There was no indication of when that would be or any regard for our time or the inconvenience of coming early to an appointment when they were not prepared to treat him. When my husband reiterated his need for help, Heather replied with a genuine lack of empathy, ""I feel for you."" Her lack of patient care shocked me! I have been working in the medical field for 30 years and don't recall a time I saw a provider so dismissive. When we realized it was again a wasted appointment and my husband was not going to be treated with care and respect, we got up to leave and Heather commented, ""It's my decision who I take on as a patient, anyway.""  Very poor patient care.

The staff was very nice and welcoming and eased my anxiety right as I checked in. Dr Grey was very easy to talk to. At first he just listened and I was a little unsure but by the end he starting joking and really wanted to get to know me personally. Anything I mentioned in the beginning of the appointment he repeated at the end and I would not have thought he would have remembered. Very detail and will ask you multiple times before you walk out...""do you have any questions"" he made me feel comfortable. It's simple, follow the rules and this practice will help you if you truly need it.|Love this place . The only pain Dr I've been to that don't judge u or treat you like a drug seeker.  He listens to you and hears you . He helped me recover from my addiction by giving me a chance to be in the Suboxone program and has continued to support me thru this journey and monitors me biweekly because I don't have the strength yet to go monthly and he knows this. I'm grateful for him for what he's done for me and I wanted to praise him for  taking me as a patient knowing I had failed a drug test in the beginning but he didn't give up on me . So I didnt give up on me either    if your struggling don't wait. Call today and make a appt for help . It's here!

The staff is very friendly and actually cares about you. Dr. Gray is the best caring doctor I have met with the best bed side manors.  I recommend Pain Clinic of North Carolina to anyone.|I had a very unfortunate experience with this practice.  I signed up for the Pfizer vaccine (this would be my 2nd one and very time sensitive).  I believe I got a few reminders from the office prior to my appointment, to make sure that remembered.  I even called myself to verify the appointment and time, and to reiterate and verify that I was getting the Pfizer vaccine.  Always, this was confirmed.  I showed up on time on the day of my appointment, sat on the exam table, and was asked if I was ready for my shot.  I said yes, and then again verified with them that I was getting the Pfizer vaccine.  Shocked, the medical assistant said that all they had left in stock was the J&J vaccine.  I explained that I could not get that, as I had already received the Pfizer.  The medical assistant then went to get Tanya.  I'm not sure of Tanya's role in the office, but it appeared that she had some sort of authority.  Tanya explained that the office had run out of Pfizer.  She said that she would be picking up or having delivered more of the Pfizer at the Health Department that day around lunch time, and that I would call me back that very afternoon to give me a time to come back.  I called the office after lunch to find out if the office had the Pfizer.  Was told Tanya was busy, but she would call back.  I then decided to drive back to the office late that afternoon, only to be told Tanya was busy, but would call me.  It is now been a few weeks.  I never got a call back.  I was able to get an appointment at a Walgreens in  Shelby, NC within the appropriate timeframe.|Diligent care. I've never felt rushed, respectful to my holistic values, always accommodating to my awful schedule giving I travel for work. Could not be more grateful for both Dr Bourne and Dr Gray.|My medical care experience at this clinic is impeccable.

Thank you guys for your care and your professionalism!|My name is Chris Ajinga.

On 13 June I had a follow up appt with Dr Harum. The appt was for a facet block/injection. I initially met Dr Harum on 31 May where he looked at my MRIs.

We discussed my pain issues and my recent diagnosis of terminal bone cancer throughout my spine.

I was seeking pain relief for the bone pain. Dr Harum prescribed a pain patch that unfortunately does not work on this pain.

As I entered the Crystal Coast Pain Management center for my scheduled appt with Dr Harum I was met by Michael who was to prep me for the facet block procedure.

I told Michael of my pain issues and it would not be possible to lay on my stomach for the procedure and that I needed to talk with Dr Harum about the pain patch he prescribed.

Michael left me and when he came back he said he spoke to Dr Harum. Dr Harum told Michael he did not remember me.

No problem as I said if he just stepped in to see me he would.

Michael said the facet block procedure was canceled as I could not lay on my stomach.

Again I asked to speak with Dr Harum regarding the ineffective pain relief prescribed and never saw him.

Michael said this day was reserved for office procedures and Dr Harum could not/would not see me and to schedule a follow up appt for next week.

I was shocked that Dr Harum could so easily dismiss a patient's request to see him during a time of urgent need.

Michael was apologetic and helped me schedule the follow up appt.

Based upon the lack of attention/ compassion demonstrated by Dr Harum, I cannot recommend this office to any patient.

It appears as though the procedures day of multiple facet blocks is their money making process.

Cannot for the life of me understand how a Doctor could be so callous and indifferent to a patient. He didn't even take the time already allotted to me to respond to my request for assistance. Not even to step in and see if he could ""remember"" me.

I will not be returning to your practice.|Chose this pain management practice because I was desperate for help and relief after weeks of constant pain and they were able to get me in to be seen sooner than other practices. I've now realized, there was a reason they had availability. Horrible experience. Rude office staff, no compassion, MD had no knowledge about my diagnosis, no medications prescribed, no calls returned, and the one test that they ordered, they didn't even do prior authorization for (even though requested multiple times), so I couldn't have it done. Major waste of my time and money.|Horrible place. Wife was in the hospital so we missed our appointment. They charged us a $150 no show fee and refuse to ever see us again unless we pay it. Apparently making sure that they knew we were not gonna make it should have been my main concern while my wife was hospitalized. Try Johnston pain management instead.|I must say that the staff have been so welcoming and friendly.  Dr. Foley is a treasure.  She doesn't make you feel awkward or embarrassed because we are in pain medication. She very tentative to my needs and makes sure I'm comfortable with her decisions.  I would recommend them in a heartbeat.  It took us over 2 months to find her and finally found her a few months ago.|I have to say the staff is the absolute best! From the doctors who alway have time for me, the assistants who make sure everything is done in a timely manner, to the reception greeting me with a smiling face. Never once have I had a problem with this office nor their staff. They truly care about their patients. They do make patients on narcotics sign an agreement. Seems pretty simple. Easy to follow and the staff really explains it. Seems to me maybe a bad review or two maybe due to their lack of following the agreement?

I bet they already know who left this review without a name bc I openly share my feelings about the few great medical establishments we have so they get the full respect deserved!|I went to the clinic with some questions about a procedure I'm supposed to be getting.  The clinic manager refused to answer, all she would say was ""your doctor discussed that with you"".  No, if they did I would not still have questions, and gate keeping information like that when you intend to stick needles into me?  No.  This place is worse than the VA.  Seriously, flat out refuse to answer questions then drop you as a patient when you won't let them out needles in you without asking what's in them.

I'm also not taking fitness advice from someone who has never seen the inside of a gym.|First of all, their answering service are whatever you want to call. It is crappy as ever. There's no way you can get hardly no way you can get to anyone. You can make several calls and everytime you get recordings and every time you push buttons, they switch to something else but nobody ever talks to me. And so, finally, after 2 days of calling a woman calls and I think she was the assistant for Vanessa beir and I told her, I said, I took only one of the pills that she gave me and I broke out in a sweat and I got itchy skin and all things started happening I just felt awful.  And they don't really do a heck of a lot about it, they said, well, the Doctor said those aren't real symptoms that the medicine doesn't have that symptoms, apparently they haven't investigated it because that is one of the symptoms of a side effect. That's why I didn't take anymore. And I wanted to talk to the Doctor and they said no. You have to come in and the doctor won't talk to me on the phone. So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do from now on.|We had to see the physician's assistant Vanessa Bair today and I do NOT recommend her, I would definitely reschedule to see someone else if she's the one you have to see. I understand that she needs to hear stuff from my husband and that's fine but I am apart of his support system, even through the V.A. I am my husbands caregiver and she acted like she didn't want to hear anything from me at all. Very unprofessional since he has a problem expressing everything that is going on (because on top of physical disabilities he also is treated for mental disabilities through the V.A.) and I DO have to help him explain everything that goes on and I KNOW everything because I am with him and help him with his everyday tasks 24/7, even his V.A. doctors understand and respect that.

There was other things that needed to be said in this appointment that my husband will have to suffer through all because I wasn't able to talk and elaborate on the things going on because she had a chip on her shoulder and wanted to show her ""authority"" or whatever. Not to mention, she put that my husband reported the side effects of constipation and such and he did NOT say that at all!! My main concern is that my husband gets the proper care needed to help relieve his pain and it was very evident that she didn't want to work with me for the better management for my husbands care.|Today was my second visit to Johnston pain management in Hampstead. I am extremely impressed by the competence, efficiency and compassion of SunnyFranken, PA and her medical staff. Prior to referral to JPM, my experience with another pain management group was filled with stress. I have had a very positive experience at JPM.|Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Able to get me in without weeks of waiting. I received an injection for nerve pain related to disc degeneration and aside from the prick of the needle for the local anesthetic, did not feel a thing! I felt significant improvement each day for about 2 weeks and at that point would say pain was about 95% resolved and only and 1-2 level. This after being at a 9-10 pain level for weeks and barely able to function in daily required tasks. They are awesome!!!!|I cannot recommend this clinic. The staff is very friendly. It appears clean. The wait times were at least an hour. I  never saw or met Dr. Holder. They only took vitals like weight, blood pressure, pill count and temperature. They never did any physical exam. Had they done a simple pelvic exam, they would have found the undissolved sutures in my pelvic area that has been causing my severe pain. They referred me out and I never received a call from the clinic I was referred help. I have met several people who have received a great deal of help but I cannot say that about my case after seeing them for about 6 months. Now, after investigating on my own, with the help of my general practitioner, we finally found the problem. I have undissolved stitches that my body has been treating like foreign objects for years and now we have found an OBGYN that will take them out. We are looking forward to having them removed. Thank you and good luck to any patients going to this clinic.|John Holder M.D is God sent he listened he understood everything I am going through.

They called me two days before the procedure stating that they have to reschedule. I said OK reschedule my procedure for the following week then the following week happened. Call me again to reschedule my appointment on a Sunday morning by this time, I have been frustrated dealing with pain morning and night. I've been to the ER because of the pain I The pain has gotten unbearable . The last time I had to reschedule my procedure to the pain center  off of Mallard Creek. Got to the doctor office or Mis. Howard  we rescheduled your appointment  at 3:15 I said no because the nurse called on Sunday stated my appointment was at 3:45. No a call or text  This is very unprofessional for a doctor office to constantly do this to a patient that was with them for over a decade Dealing with chronic pain|After a horrible experience with a lumbar puncture at another location,
my experience here was easy, painless and pleasant - the difference between night and day.  The staff was over the top friendly, considerate and professional.
Just one stick and my x-ray guided lumbar puncture was accomplished. Dr. Ajam talked to me the whole time - making me feel informed and comfortable about my spine. Everything went well.
The office itself is convenient and in a very pleasant neighborhood. Traffic was not bad at all.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  (Dr. Ajam was wonderful!)|Lee Campbell thank you! I have never had a physician work with me like this and I will never forget the level of care you have given me. I'm never a number. You listen and keep me assured of our plan. I know there is light at the end of this and I know you will be by my side as we work to the end. I'm blessed to have you and I'm able to live a functioning life because of you and your care. I can work and care for my children. This wouldn't be possible without you.|I've been a patient here I believe for tough to 2 years or longer. The doctors here do excellent work medically speaking. Currently I'm suffering from sciatic pain in my right leg severely. I have scheduled an appointment with therapeutic rehabilitation for my first appointment on October 18. I requested for a few pain pills until I could make my earliest appointment October 17. I was refused. I am in total disagreement with their refusal. I myself have pumped thousands of dollars into this office. I am severely dissatisfied with their decision to allow me to stay in pain. Therefore I terminated them all.b They'll never receive another penny from me. I wrote this to make everyone aware of how I have been treated.|I've been going to Dr Lee Campbell for several years now and I know that he is the sweetest person out there. I've never had a  specialist like him. He will always listen to what I would say to him and when he came into my room he would say hello, how you doing and a handshake. I have been blessed with a great man and friend who has not only been there for my pain but he has been there for me. There were several times he would pray for me and the situation I was in, and sometimes gave me a hug to reassure me that I am worthy, and nobody has ever done anything like this before. Maybe some Drs are scared to, but I thank God he sent me a great Dr who cares about my health, family and my life. God Bless you Dr. Lee Campbell.|Awesome staff to say the least! Dr. Deering completely calmed my anxious he took the time to listen. I wasn't rushed or hurried. The procedure for the injection went really well, exactly as he described. He talked to me throughout the entire process, explained each procedure. I'm so Happy on my way to pain free.  I feel great! We highly recommended!|Dr Deering was giving me injections for my painful lower spine due to arthritis. During the second visit for injections, my right leg jumped up off the table and I let them know it hurt a lot because I vocalized my pain. I never saw Dr Deering, only his shoes through the little hole in the table for my face as I was laying on my stomach. After that procedure, I couldn't walk! My right knee went numb and collapsed! Andrew, I guess that was his name, said it happens sometimes and said it should go away in a few minutes. Well, it didn't and he called my husband from the waiting room so he could help me walk out and leave. Occasionally my left knee collapsed also. I was very scared not knowing what had happened to me, nor was I given any explanation. I was supposed to return for a RFA treatment yet I was never called to schedule this. In Dr Deering's notes it says that I was monitored for 30 minutes! That's totally false! We were ushered out asap. After a day in bed, I had to use a walker for a week until I trusted my legs again. I even had my husband drive me to appointments because I never was told what happened, so I couldn't trust myself. It finally passed after a week.
Never going back to him and because of him I'm starting to loose my trust in doctors! I'm 63 yrs young and I won't stand for this rudeness and unprofessionalism, and I'd prefer a two-sided conversation! My first visit he walked out of me when I was talking! I should have noticed the red flag then, especially when I had several concerns that he refused to listen to! Never! Never! Never again! This happened in early June of 2022. My advice, look more into a doctors background. Spinal issues should not be taken lightly. You're only mm's away from paralysis!!|Sub-par at best.
Doctor Deering seems trustworthy and Boston Scientific as well so far for my internal back stimulator, but the office/practive overall is somewhat of a joke. They don't answer the phone, ever. If and when they do, it's someone in Winston-Salem, NC., someone who clearly does not know what's going on in Charlotte as I was supposed to have an appointment this morning with Dr. Deering but upon arrival was told he is on vacation and they are not sure how I got scheduled for today. Fine. Unacceptable, but fine. Next appointment with the Dr. wasn't for two weeks. No thanks, in too much pain to wait that long. Will go elsewhere from now on. If this were the first instance of having difficulty reaching ANYONE at the practice I wouldn't even be writing this review, but as it has been this way EVERY SINGLE TIME, my patience has run out. Avoid CPI in Charlotte if you can IMHO.",2024-09-13|2024-04-24|2023-12-18|2023-10-12|2023-08-31|2021-08-06|2022-09-21|2023-03-30,1|5|5|3|5|5|1|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJJee-jc8hVIgRoek4qtKrGPA,34

After noticing Dr Buzzanell exhibiting serious memory problems and the entire staff refusing to answer legitimate questions, I did a little research. If you are a patient or are considering becoming one, please check into why this doctor was allowed to have his medical license reinstated after one of his patients died. Then check into ALL patient deaths associated with this doctor.|Had high hopes my chronic spinal pain would be remedied. Had a long talk with Dr. Buzznell, felt pressured to agree to schedule an ablation, without seeing any MRIs, or surgeon findings. I should have asked him about why he doesn't practice medicine in Pennsylvania anymore. Do your own research before dealing with any of these ""pain"" doctors. They aren't interested in your pain level, only your insurance level. I was hoping this place was legit.|If you're in pain, there is no better place to go than going to the Blue Ridge Pain Management . From the minute you walk in with being greeted and staff member that brings you in for your appointment
could not be any more friendlier and professionalism. Dr Charles Buzzanell will listen to what you got to say about what is going on with your pain issues . You will feel like your being listened to and not being rushed.  It's nice to feel there are other options to your care and not a one fits all attitude.|I've been going to Blue Ridge Pain Management now for quite a while. I got to the point where my pain was under control and I left for approximately 7 months but had to go back. I'm not one to take narcotics unless absolutely necessary and that's one thing that this pain management clinic knows about me. Of course they do other things besides give out medications. I was having injections for various conditions and I was being sent to physical therapy where I actually had what is called dry needling in my arms, where I was having pain for some unknown reason and the dry needling worked a miracle where the pain in my arms has never returned and I owe that suggestion to Spencer Maney. Dr. Buzzanell and Spencer Maney are both very professional and very personable and easy to talk to. So if you need someplace to help you deal with your pain in a multitude of ways, I recommend giving Blue Ridge Pain Management a try.|I really like Dr. Buzzanell. He's very professional. I was in a car accident & because of the blunt force to my upper body, he diagnosed a trapezius injury. Usually someone might have that trauma from a sports injury. I went to several Doctors, they all just gave me steroid shots nothing was helping. He recommended I have my nerves blocked in the area most effected.
What a difference!! If you saw before & after pictures. WOW.!!!! Soft tissue damage is not detected in MRI's,          C-SCAN or X-Rays. He is the only one to help my severe pain & it wasn't with pills. It was a treatment!!!|I am sure worried about Dr buzznell and staff after this awful hurricane if anyone has any info can u please share and thank you so much|This practice is filled with wonderful, caring, and knowledgeable professionals! Their practice and office environment seems to function like a very close family. That's exactly the way they've treated my dad. He's a 76 year old with impaired vision and Dr. Buzzanell has tended to him with sincere compassion. My dad talks about him for days after each visit. He's so happy to finally have a doctor that has the skills and genuinely cares enough to help him with the back pain that has ailed him for 55 years. Taking him to this practice was the best healthcare decision I've ever made for my dad.|My past experiences with pain management clinics/ doctors had left me feeling pretty much invisible. When they treat you like cattle being branded you lose all confidence in their ability to actually HELP you.
Dr. Buzzanell has never treated me that way in the slightest.  Right away he took a sincere approach to my situation and all that I had been through, which was quite a lot. He didn't rush me in the front door and out the back. The treatments we agreed to were very helpful. When I didn't get the best results with a treatment another procedure has been offered and I look forward to this next step. It seems as if no matter how busy his day has been (and they always are) he  always takes plenty of time to listen to me. He and his staff have always treated me respectfully which is a rare act to find in this day and time. (Especially for an older lady on Medicare!)
Thank you Dr. Buzzanell and staff. Y'all have been a Godsend.
I am on disability due to severe arthritis and severe fibromyalgia.  I underwent 10, yes ten, surgeries in 2018 alone due to my arthritis.

You won't feel as though you're just another number. These Doctors are very caring about each patient. They work beyond the scope of just managing pain, for example: if a blood work panel reveals something out of the ordinary the Doctors will refer the patients to the needed help. I can go on and on about this company of loving/caring team of professional individuals, but every person in need of this type of assistance will have to go through the proper channels to experience it for themselves. I drive over an hour to get there but it's worth it all. The assistance I've been provided has allowed me to have a better quality of life.
My name is Stephanie L|So I don't normally do this, give a bad review. But I feel like people should know the way that this office and it's owner treats their patients.

If you're familiar with the globe, then you no doubt realize it's well-nigh impossible to get further away from Raleigh NC than the Philippines & China, unless of course you're launched into SPACE!  Well during those 5 years, I made quarterly trips back to Raleigh to see my doctor at Carolina Pain & Spine.

If you dislike air travel as much as I do, you'd no doubt consider slitting your wrists before undertaking such a burden.  Moreover, the financial cost alone would be enough to dissuade most people.  Nonetheless, if that  medical care was indispensable to continued full-time employment, as it was in my case, & you had 6 kids, most parents would at least try to do as I did.

Perhaps the ONLY tangible benefit such an insane travel regimen bestows is the enormous cache of frequent flyer miles (650k++ when 'doubling' & 'tripling' of mileage is triggered).  But when one is in severe pain in Asia, where the medical profession has a considerably different philosophy vis-a-vis the relief of chronic pain, it should come as no surprise that an American with adequate funds would be prepared to take drastic steps in order to continue working in his/her chosen profession.|Everyone was friendly and it was nice and clean. I love the PA that I have, because she explained everything to me and helped me out a lot. She understood where I was coming from when I explained to her what was going on and she answered my question truthfully. I just love the place over all and will send anyone there to get treatment if they having any type of trouble with their spine. And I learned that it was not what people were telling me about the pain clinic it was just as I was expected.|I moved to NC from PA and the laws are very different, I had a lot of trouble finding a doctor that would even see me and no one would give me a reason why, they just said they couldn't help me. Carolina Pain & Spine took me in and guided me to not only fit NC laws but to do it the way that worked best for me, my voice was heard and I knew that from the start! I have now moved two hours away from them and have considered finding something closer to me, but after reading reviews of other places and the horrendous horror stories, I will not be going anywhere else. They are well worth my routinely 4 hour drive to see them and know that I'm being given the best possible care. I get examined routinely, I get tests done instantly when something feels off.. I have had falls, and they don't just do what they want, they seriously listen and to me, Being heard, especially after dealing with your pain for many many years and knowing what works, what doesn't and what even aggravates the pain is everything!! I would recommend them to anyone, not one particular doctor or PA, they are all great and this includes all staff there, I have never once gotten an attitude or had a bad experience and I've been going for about a year now. Even issues I've had with the pharmacy to where I've had to call the office we're always handled quickly and efficiently. They don't always answer the phone, I mean they are working, but leave a message and they are on it that day! All rooms are clean, the wait is never too long, waiting room is always open with plenty of seats. As long as I'm in NC, I will be going here regardless of the drive.|Worst customer service you have to constantly keep on them to get prescription sent in and taking care of on time however you must be in the office 15 minutes early or you're not on time just all around bad customer service|I have been a patient of Dr. Schrimanker's for over a decade.

Still wondering if I got bamboozeled as I never noted one degree or license to practice on the wall. The entire experience was incredibly frustrating as I've seen multiple physicians who have referred me to Pain Management to help manage my pain only to get to this physician who is completely Unsympathetic with a small man complex on a Drs high and thinks you should worship the ground he walks on because he supposedly went to medical school and  could quite frankly care less about his patients. Boy was I disappointed and disgusted. he possessed less of the characteristics of a good doctor then I have ever seen before. He did less then a five minute exam and then made his conclusion. He bullied gas light and shot down every suggestion with no promise of hope or helping find a diagnosis. Leaving me in an incredibly unsafe position. then, had the audacity to shake my hand as he left the room ( I was in shock). I left the office in tears incredibly angry and extremely frustrated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this physician at all costs As he clearly Could care less about his Hippocratic oath|Kicked out for having two clean urine screens. Meaning I was punished because I didn't need meds a couple days (especially after injections) Never heard of being kicked out for not using more meds than you need.  Pill count was always okay. They went back months in my chart. No one talked to me about any problems. Then out of the blue PA decided to no longer treat me. Staff are uncaring. They have a large turn over of doctors lately.

The entire staff is friendly, professional, and extremely helpful.  There is adequate parking, a very clean office, and all the latest equipment for diagnostics and individual treatments. The individual care given by Dr. Haasis and his entire staff is amazing.  THEY ACTUALLY LISTEN AND CARE!!!  Due to the reason I am there (chronic pain), not having to wait long periods for my appointment (sitting is worse than standing) is a true blessing. I know this does not occur without a dedicated team effort and respect regarding the patient's time. Even though you are in pain, the  positive   environment there is very beneficial.   I get injections 4 times a year with extremely good results. Dr. Haasis is very skilled and reassuring during procedures.   When I lived in Dallas, I had to go to a hospital to get them.  It is so much easier here and because I have so much trust in my doctor and his staff, anxiety free.  I feel I am so lucky to have found Dr. Haasis and his wonderful staff.  I know they are a great team:  caring, intelligent,  professional, dedicated, patient, and helpful.  I am a retired RN (25 yrs) and am familiar with both sides of the coin....

However, in my opinion, the doctor is a 100% useless, money grabbing loser who didn't seem to have a clue about how to treat back pain or be willing to help my wife while in his office.

He said ""after he had a chance to look at x-rays he'd call us back in and then recommend treatment.  He could have seen the x-rays then but said we'd have to come back at another time.
Now, almost two months and three messages left for him later, I still have not had call, email or text from the office.  I did get a $125.00 bill from them saying my Medicare and BCBSnc didn't fully cover his bill.  I wish I have never heard of

Super nice people with great attitudes who treat you like family. Candace at the desk is an outstanding professional, friendly person who is so kind and sweet. Jennifer is a phenomenal PA, who is attentive and sweet and always shows compassion as well as professionalism.|I should've avoided this place when I read the initial reviews from others. I went in for a physical exam from a referral from my provider several weeks ago in order to schedule the pain injection to my SI joint. The doctor indicated there are 2 different injections that can be done to the area (1 of which isn't approved by insurance, so we went with the one that is). Taking that into account we scheduled the injection appointment 2 weeks' out to ensure ample time to everything to be processed. Additionally it was important to get the appointment in before the end of the year since I have hit my out of pocket max for 2023 already.

I received a call the day of indicating that insurance had denied the claim due to insufficient information from the doctor, and the out of pocket cost would be $550. When I communicated the information, they indicated I would have to come in for another physical exam so the doctor could resubmit to insurance, and therefore would be unable to get the injection before the end of the year.

I then asked if it was possible to pay the out of pocket amount of $550, and then if/when the insurance claim is approved to receive a reimbursement. They responded with no unfortunately once I paid the $550 it would be gone.

So not only has several weeks of my time been wasted (looks like the denial happened a week ago), but now that the injection can't happen anywhere before the end of the year Wake Spine and Pain has cost me several hundred dollars regardless of who I go through since I'll have to get it done in 2024.

Completely unreasonable responses and timing from them at every corner, and incompetence (and a laziness on completing notes to the insurance provider) from the doctor as well. If I could give 0 stars I would, and this place should be avoided.|One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I've had chronic pain for 12 years. I have tricare. I was referred to this ""pain management"" clinic by my primary docter. This place will do nothing but push physical therapy and steroid injections. I waited a month for this appt. I left in just as much pain as I showed up in due to the physican assistants negligence. She treated me like I was someone off the street trying to get opiates. I asked for the lowest dosage pain killer she could give me to take the edge off till mri results came back and immediately shut me down because she insisted I take the same tests I've taking with other doctors and wanted to just prescribe me another brand of the same medicine that wasn't working. If you have tricare and expect to have some sort of pain relief from this place look else where. The physician assistant there is rude, doesn't listen to anything you see, and jumps to conclusions. She ended my appointment after I refused to take the same tests I've already taking.

He truly cares & listens to his patients, he developed a plan to manage my pain through various complex issues. He has always been available as needed. He is such a nice man! He is rare find !|Today was my first visit with Dr. Edminston & his wonderful staff!  After being in so much pain for so many years, I had almost given up on of having any improvement in my symptoms or the quality of life.  I was very  pleasantly surprised with how much time the doctor took to listen to me, explain things & offer suggestions.  He made it clear that it wouldn't be a quick fix & also was honest about things I would also need to change in my lifestyle.  All of his staff was so kind & caring! I now have hope that the possibility of having more good days than bad can be achieved!|Dr Edmiston is the best Doctor I have had since my accident. He is and has been the greatest.  He listens and is very attentive. I love being his patient because I know I can count on him.|Dr Edmundson and staff are kind and caring!  He takes the time to listen to me and help me understand my pain issues.  I have gone to other doctors and he's the best!  Wouldn't go to any other doctor!|Dr. Edminston is one of the best physicians I have been to and sadly I have been to many.  He is very caring and empathetic.  As well, he is very knowledgeable.  I would and have recommend him to just about anyone.|I rate Dr. 5++++ stars his staff..
Well now that's totally different rating. Unfortunately ""The One"" nurse definitely needs attitude check especially when it comes to working with PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PAIN !
Patient has to sign contract & part of the agreement is RESPECT for staff/nurses or BE DISCHARGED!!! SHE could at least FAKE a smile & Pretend to have COMPASSION. Not that SHE does.... time to Retire or find another area of nursing.. bothers me to even say this.. Nuff said.|Be careful all you patients if u test positive it can be a false positive if u have a high kidney and liver count this dr will cut u off without any notice or forewarning and no recommendations which he is supposed to supply I was a perfect patient never missed a pill count or test for 2 1/2 years not even a retest to confirm especially when the patient has a debilitating incurable disease and relies on medication to survive. That's not compassion or good practice . I lodged a complaint with the A.M.A. As well

My issue is the fact that they let me know three weeks before as opposed to three months ago . Now I'm going to have a lapse in care and treatment when I could have started the process at a different location. If they truly cared about their patients' well being, they would have e given notice to avoid lapse in treatment or care. I would have even been willing to pay out of pocket. It is unfortunate that they don't care about their patients' well being.|16 months and not a moment without s reaming pain! Thanks to ""Dr"" Tellis and PA Foley. Tellis did a nerve ablasion and did not numb L5/S1. L4/5 was deadened. This caused me to hyperextend coming up off the table. This herniated L3/4, and ripped both hips. Then they want to dump you. Starting multiple corrective surgeries. Horrid place!!! Go to New Bern!|Lindsay Smith has been my pain management professional for almost five years. I've got neck and back injuries from a challenging law enforcement career; now retired. Every time I've had breakthrough pain, Lindsay has known exactly what to do to resolve the issue. She's professional, knowledgeable, experienced, empathetic, and her people skills are outstanding. Being her patient is a genuine asset to my quality of life, and as long as she's at Crystal Coast Pain Management, I'll keep going there.|My pain was originally dismissed as psychological even before any work up was completed. I requested to be transferred to Dr Auman and I had the most wonderful experience with her. She had taken her time with me, explained things, and really made me feel like my concerns were validated, she treated me like a person. Highly recommend Dr Auman!!!!|Elizabeth J. Raynor FNP-BC, FNP-C is who I saw Today I actually got in my car and cried all the way from the office to my house I drove 1 hour and 20 mins to this appointment to be treated so  so nasty and rude she was disgusting her attitude her behavior!  first thing she said was I don't treat RA with opioids. I'm confused why that was the first thing she said she never actually told me what her plan was? or how? she actually treats RA for her patients. The worst part she looked me in my face several times and said well that is life life is unfair she repeated that multiple times felt like somebody punch me in my stomach I have never had a doctor treat and talk to me like that ever in my life! I pray she never gets cancer because it would suck for a doctor to look at her and say that is unfortunate, unfortunately  life is not fair wow!!! as patients we come in already dealing with so much we didn't ask for this to happen so the comment well life is just unfair is extremely unacceptable. She does not need to be working for a pain managment practice if she feels like that. Worst experience of my life!|The office received my physician's referral 10 Jan, but when I called twice to see if they needed me to have other records transmitted I was lied to both times about the time of receipt. Today I was told the processor was still working on referrals from the first week of Jan, so I would not get a call until the middle of Feb at the earliest.  Her time problem was explained as ""the doctors aren't here all the time."" It is clear the office staff is not efficient & not always truthful. My guess is that the doctors & the corporate office are not aware that many of their patients are suffering because of the attitude & inefficiency of the support staff.  When I asked for a referral (to anyplace) from the office of my neurologist I was warned about staff inefficiency.  (Note:  Johnston Pain Management also suffers from the same problem.)  Update:  By going through the office manager I finally got an appt., which went well. However, my records were not rec'd, which prevents me from my treatment. I called the previous practice & was told the request had never been rec'd. I called Coastal to report that & spoke to Carla, who would only refer me to Naomi, who wasn't there, & would not notify Dr. Auman of the problem. I had to repeat the problem 3 times, as she didn't seem to understand, & then she reprimanded me, ""Don't be ugly!""  So I still can't get treatment, & have no idea what happened to my record request.  Whether it is the fault of one practice or another, I just want to get the problem resolved so I can receive treatment. I don't need to be treated with disdain, but like a respected patient in need of medical care. I like my doctor, but the staff attitude is blocking our relationship & my care.|I have had the opportunity to be referred to Dr. Auman at Crystal Coast Pain Management a few months ago. I have been treated with the utmost respect and dignity, while undergoing; epidurals, cervical facet blocks, as well as gel knee injections and RFA's. I would like to commend Dr Auman for treating her staff with kindness and displaying a positive roll model to her staff. I'm very lucky that my primary care physician, Dr Manalukas recommended me to Dr. Courtney Auman. She has taken an active roll in my recovery and I'm very appreciative for her caring attitude.|Today was my very first appointment. Everyone  there was so very pleasant and professional.  I had a good experience with my doctor, went on to the pharmacy after and there was a small issue with my insurance.  When I  called the doctors office they were already on it. Amazing.

The doctor spoke to me about a treatment plan, understood my concerns, and gave me options that I felt comfortable with (I wanted to avoid specific ""hard"" medications). They listened to me and have set me up with a plan to help until I have a surgery date scheduled.
They also were advocates to the insurance company for me when the insurance company didn't understand the treatment plan. I am beyond thankful for their team and happy I go to this office!|I've never had a bad interaction with anyone at this location. Upon arriving the facility is clean and welcoming. The reception ladies are kind and respectful. The patient rooms are clean in smell and looks. I am usually seen by Jazzmene, Meredith, and Angel. They have always took my concerns in to consideration, and allowed me to be an active participant in my own care. They take the time listen, educate, and comfort when needed. Meredith has been the primary doctor that I see. I am fortunate, because with her help I went from being in agonizing facial pain and headaches 95% of the time to less than 5 severe episodes a month. If you're on the fence about this place, just go. You're in great hands!|To the Owner :
Last week I called this location  and spoke to a very friendly voice and i mentioned that I was confirming my appointment  for a few days in advance.

When I arrived there were 3 young women that check you in.
Each one was  friendly  and professional.

I have been going to this place for many years but one thing I like about it is the people who work up front.

Even when I was checking out all three of these women were very cheerful and helpful.

Thank you!
*Gary Stewart|The staff and doctors here are absolutely awesome.  Today was my first appointment and I had anxiety about my condition and whether the doctor would be empathetic to my needs.  The doctor was extremely caring; I didn't feel rushed, and they took the time to address all my concerns. I am very pleased with this center.  I would definitely recommned them for your neurology and pain management needs.|If I could give zero stars, I would!  I had a referral put into this office and when I went to my 9:00 a.m. appointment Michelle at the front desk told me my appointment was not here and I'm not in the system at all. She explained where the other Neurology clinic is so I drive there. When I get there, I'm not in their system either. So I call my insurance and she tells me it is the first place I went to...so I drive all the way back to first place. After 5-10 minutes of looking me up in their system they finally locate my referral. Michelle hands me the phone to talk to Hayley and she tells me she located my referral and she schedule me an appointment for me. I tell her well I'm here now- I got here before my appointment time and i paid for a babysitter as well. I have to be seen today. Hayley then talks to Jasmine and Jasmine tells me to have a seat in the lobby and they will talk to the doctor to see if they can see me. After waiting 10 minutes, they tell me they cannot see me today and Jasmine asks me ""how far is Sanford from you?"" Now this office is wanting me to commute to Sanford?!?! I told her I'm here for my scheduled appointment now. I had all the arrangements and got to my appointment before 9:00a.m that I wasn't one minute late to. This was so stressful, lack of communication and care. I hardly write reviews but I am in so much pain and they have me go back and forth- wasting gas, time, money on babysitter and energy! I do not recommend this place! I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else!|Thanks to Dr. Nailesh Dave and Neema Dave, PA-C I am no longer fully dependent on my wheelchair!  The care and support I have received over the past 5+ years has been a God send.  After a through evaluation and diagnostic testing, I found out that my pain wasn't just related to one issue but a combination of several issues.  The providers treat me with respect,  care, and compassion that is easily missed nowadays in the healthcare arena. I am listened to fully and understand my care plan every step of the way. There is honestly no comparison to where my pain level was and where I am now today.  I am thankful to have such a great team to help cheer me on and help get back what pain took away. Do not hesitate in being seen by this practice-you will be thankful you did!|I have been a patient of this company for nearly ten years. I have always been a fan of the staff in lillington, but in recent months, one of my medicines has become difficult to find, causing me to be a pain in the butt to the nurses as I switch my pharmacy, often. The nurses always call back quickly, answer my requests with cheery voices, etc., despite me causing more work for them. The Sanford office is much closer for me, but I go out of my way to lillington because of the people and how I am always treated. The nurses, especially, make this facility worthwhile and each one of them has been an absolute gem to deal with, every single time!! Thank you for always being incredible! <3|I had a appoint with the PA Bianca in Fay. My appointment was at 815 a.m. I got there 817a.m. the Receptionist said 820a.m. but she wasn't at the window for 3 minutes.

My doctor was very nice and answered all my questions. He explained everything that he was doing to me as he was doing it. Overall was a great experience.|I had 3 level ACDF surgery 9 months ago in another state and have since moved to NC. My entire process from telling my PCP about my pain to surgery, took about 5 months; PT, MRI, X-rays, day of surgery, (no pain management) etc. My pain sadly started back around Thanksgiving and I knew what it was and am not really happy but here I am. From making it known to my Dr., I JUST went to ECPC today but on par with everything, due to wonderful insurance, gotta wait for that injection! I've done most of the work basically from start, and can't say I'm thrilled about the ECU health system, but ECPC was probably one of my most favorite and best medical appointments ever. After a fairy long wait for everything I've done before coming here, I was shocked to be called Tuesday for an appointment Thursday. I was adamant about no injections, but I have to have some relief and pray I don't regret changing my mind. I hope the rest of this long road is as easy of a time as I had today. Just 1 wish: I wish Dr. U was my PCP!!! Kudos to your company, job well done.|I can't stress enough how great the staff & providers are at ECPC pain specialists. They are so very caring, attentive, and nurturing in ways that made me feel understood, cared for & most importantly validated.  I would 10/10 recommend this clinic, staff, and facilities. I had a consultation on a Tuesday & received my first treatment on Thursday. Again, everything was explained thoroughly & as I waited for the procedure to begin I was kept calm and assured that I would be well taken care of. Dr. Doerr was so professional yet down to Earth. Even though I pray to have less pain in the upcoming days, months, years... I know exactly where I will be returning to in the event that things persist. I love being treated well and humanized without judgement. Thank you ECPC for being amazing.|Dr. Unnithan did my prior procedures I have to say I felt with his experience I felt I was in very good hands .

I do recommended him for sure to my friends or family needing his help.
I drive an hour from my house to be seen in his office and it is 100% worth it.|They kept pushing for the ablation..looks at me and says we dont give opiods here.. i did not ask for them I just want to stop hurting so much so they gave me gabapentin.. now Im seeing double and still hurting.|My husband has had five back surgeries and has a ten-level fusion with extensive hardware. We saw Dr Hamsher for a pain management consultation so my husband could have his internal pain pump re-installed and managed. Dr Hamsher was wonderful BUT he told us there are ""politics"" associated with pain pumps and that in order for him to do the pain pump, my husband would have to be off his oral opiates for six weeks. If my husband could be off oral opiates for six weeks and still manage activities of daily living like bathing, eating, etc. HE WOULD NOT NEED A PAIN PUMP!!!!! His PCP and spine surgeon could not believe such a ridiculous policy, no doubt made by pencil-pushing administrators who never see patients and have no idea what they are going through. I suggest you find a different pain management facility, as this one cares NOTHING about patients! Avoid Atrium and go to Novant Health instead.

To the ""owner's"" response to my review.......you have his information, including his phone number. If you were so concerned about making things better, YOU would have someone reach out to HIM. You want HIM to waste more of his time to reach out to YOUR customer service line so they can learn how to make things better??? Again, you are ridiculous!!!! You have the complaint right here. YOU do something about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No wonder all the negative reviews on here. Your ""politics"" are a joke.

She is patient, personable, genuine and gives excellent care to my mother. Dr. Brooks always listens, questions and interacts with her kindly. I never write reviews but was shocked by the negative comments and felt a fair review was in order from someone who does not seek narcotic drugs. Thank you Dr. Brooks for your excellent service to your patients.|I've been going here for a year to have my back pain treated.  I had a shot last August that worked great, had another on in July this year (2022).  It didn't work as well, then I developed piriformus syndrome, pain of which I never felt.  I called their office and couldn't be seen for a little over a week.  They scheduled an injection for Sept 19, it has now been over a month since my pain began.
The day before my injection, my left side started hurting just like my right side.  I told them before I got the injection, they showed no concern.  Today the nurse called to see how I was doing and I told her about the pain on the left side.  She said there wasn't anything they could do so basically I have to be in excruciating pain.  Whenever I try to walk every few steps my leg gives out with me causing me to almost fall.  I almost passed out earlier because of the pain.
I'm going to have to find another practice that will help me.|This place is the worst pain clinic I've ever attended. Takes them a week to return phone calls. The doctors claim not to believe in opioid therapy for chronic pain patients only cancer patients. The don't listen to you as a human being just quote back CDC guidelines like they're regulations that are immutable. They've forgotten their hippocratic oath and chose to instead to protect their license and let their patients suffer. Don't waste your time or money.|I suffered from a serious hand and arm injury 7 months ago.  (Parchel Amputation) . After 4 surgery's and months of therapy I am still experiencing pain from damaged nerves.  My surgeon referred me to pain management as treatment for my condition.  His orders were for a opioid taper which means slow reduction of pain meds.  They refused to follow my Drs orders and refused to give me anything to ease the burning pain that is pure torture.  It's also very dangerous for someone to be taken off pain meds COLD TURKEY.  They don't care about the patient or what the surgeon who has been treating you says.  I will be filing a complaint with the NC medical board  !!! They placed a nerve stimulator in my arm and 60 days later when they removed it they broke a wire off in my arm that got infected which required surgery to remove when it got infected.

I was ready to give up when my friend found this place and they stated they would take my insurance. After talking with them and how they would give me treatments I agreed. Upon my first treatment I slept when I came home after almost 7 years of missed sleep. I was diagnosed in 2003! I have been sleeping every since. It's affordable and they care.

Let me start by saying that I have been managed at a pain doctor for the last seven years with no issues, and my doctor has gotten me to be able to live my life again. I went from walking with a cane and barely able to stand up to being able to work a little bit again. Unfortunately, my doctor has decided to close her practice and sent my entire file to this pain clinic as a referral. I did not check the reviews prior to my visit. My mistake and one I will never make again.

This practice is extremely corporate focused. From the minute you walk in you can tell that they're more interested in volume of patients then really truly assessing your needs. It's part of the reason why our pain epidemic in this country is so bad in my opinion. Even though my entire chart had been sent to this doctor, he did not review it ahead of my appointment, and spent a total of nine minutes with me, which included my four minute exam.

I suffer from multiple issues, including fibromyalgia, and lupus, along with nerve pain. It has been very well managed for a number of years and I was not looking to make any changes or add any additional medicines of any kind.

Not only was the doctor rude, but he barely made eye contact and he ran from room to room seeing three other patients at least in the same amount of time I was waiting for him to come back to do the exam after changing into a gown.

During my exam, I was asked to walk around the room, bend over, stand on my tiptoes, and was basically chastised because I'm well managed pain wise. His comment to me was that ""see, you're fine"". Of course, I'm doing fine, I've been managed well for many years. He told me that ""I'm on too much medicine for someone my age"" even though I've been on the same medication for many years and I am going to have issues down the road.

You could tell Dr. Hancock was rushed and did not have time or an interest in me.

I realize that there are a lot of people that seek drugs, but I've been to physical therapy, gotten massages and swim, stay active to help control my pain, but he didn't even ask about that. My entire 9 year battle with pain had been diminished to 9 minutes.

I left the practice in tears, and the nursing staff didn't even ask me if I was OK. The front desk girls are rude and could care less about the people. It was painfully obvious that every single person there has a time limit for patients, and that they hold that very seriously.

I left this appointment feeling violated. I was terribly shaking the rest of the day, and still find myself emotional now. No doctor should ever have the right to treat you that way. I am going to do a follow up with the practice to let them know how I feel but from what I've seen on here it won't matter. I'm sure I'll get the same comment everybody else's getting with we'd like to hear more, please call us at...

Sadly, I spent more time with a girl accepting my copayment than I spent with the doctor. I will never return, but I did learn a valuable lesson and that's that we are our own advocates, and that we have to stand up to people/companies like this.

I hope if Dr. Hancock reads this he checks in with his compassion once in a while.|Last week was my first time visiting this practice.  I was called back into the room really quickly, but that's where the appointment really began to transition to dog time.  By the time Dr Manepalli made it to my room I had nodded off several times.

As far as the good doc himself, he conducted himself very professionally.  He actually seemed like he was taking in what I was saying about my symptoms.

I can't speak the treatment that one might receive from any of the other practitioners,  but I would certainly recommend Dr Manepalli to anyone looking for a nice, competent and professional doctor.|Had my first appointment today Ive been in pain for the last 30 days severe pain. Nurse practitioner comes in and says that I need to see a psychiatrist you have no idea how bad I've been feeling. I'm there for my pain not for you to recommend for me to see a psychiatrist. This pain management office was the worst place I've ever been to. The nurse that I had she was very rude. I wouldn't recommend this pain management clinic very very unprofessional. Drug tested me you asked do I do drugs I tell you no I don't and you drug test me anyway this was the worst experience and I was embarrassed.|I would leave zero stars if I could. 1st off I was NOT seeking medication! I have a type of arthritis that has affected my SI joint. Was sent here for an injection. Was told Dr Manipelli was the best and he does 100s of these a year. No medication to calm my nerves was offered before the procedure. Got in the procedure room and the attendants were very nice. As he began he said you'll feel pressure.. It was PAIN! After multiple attempts he couldn't access the joint. I could feel him scraping my bone, so much it reverberated in my teeth. Finally he was able to administer meds to the  joint. My body was in shock after the excruciating procedure and I was shaking uncontrollably. All staff was concerned about was getting me out the door as quickly as possible, ignoring the fact that I was struggling after the procedure. In the midst of all this Dr Manipelli stuck his head in the recovery area and was very nonchalant that he couldn't access the joint after multiple attempts and ""oh yea, you're going to be sore.""After being told I'd feel like a new person, I left in a wheelchair. My husband and son had to carry me in the house and pick me up to take me to the restroom for 3 days. I absolutely couldn't walk. They offered me no post op care. Procedure was done Dec 6, and I still have pain from the procedure now in Mid Jan. I was so traumatized from this that I canceled the follow up because there's no way I'd ever go back to this office. Literal PTSD. I have been waiting on a survey from the office but of course none was ever sent so I decided to leave a google review. I pray that this helps someone to decide to NOT go to this office. Worst medical experience of my entire life.|Dr Ashok Manepalli had my mother sign paperwork on August 15 for pain management medication.  He never send a prescription to the pharmacy.   I call to request he call regarding her medication on September 11 and he returned the call to my mother on September 12th.  She has memory loss so I am not exactly sure of the conversation but she agreed to wait until her appointment on September 15 before being given a prescription for pain medication.  We have been seeing this Doctor since July and feel he has been dragging out her care.  She has extreme back pain.  I had to cancel a procedure since she was admitted to the hospital and sent an email via my chart.  He claims he called but I have no record of receiving a call from him on my cell phone.  He did not leave a message either.  The number provided was correct.  I called the office to be told he did call me and read off notes recorded in her chart.  I did not receive a call from him.  I am moving her care to another pain management doctor.  I do not suggest anyone go to this pain management clinic.  I ask who was over this clinic and was told Dr Hancock.  I requested to have him call me and was told he most likely would not call me back.|I wish I didn't have to put a star here, I was send to this pain clinic for back pain for herniated disk in my back, the front desk help was rude and unfriendly, the PA is less than helpful, the doctor only seen me one time for back injection, that hasn't helped. I'm not on anything for pain except hydrocodone 1month supply, and was told there would be no more prescribed to me, yet there are people in the waiting area nodding out. Seems the people with legitimate problems get no help but drug addicts are welcome with open arms. I wouldn't recommend you go here if you're in pain. You would probably get better attention somewhere else. It seamed a little sketchy from the beginning, but I was referred there by my PA that I trust but have let him know. This place is truly a joke. Not funny when you need help go elsewhere!!|1st the nurses we're very nice. HOWEVER!I gave extensive history to the Dr and he treated me like a straight up druggie. They will disregard someone who is truely suffering with background and Xrays but pass prescriptions out to ppl nodding off in their own office how sad and ridiculous! I have been sick since I was 12 yrs old and at that time had no control over what they chose to treat my pain with. I was trying to switch Drs to get care form a Dr. That was associated with the hospital. I was treated with such disrespectful bedside manner and disregard for my pain. Also as a matter of fact I just lost my husband in 2022, and he was a patient there and they let him suffer needlessly until we had to call in hospice. That should speak volumes right there. 2 different doctors same disregard for the pain and suffering. You draw your own conclusions! Personally I think this place is just in it for the Almighty Dollar! God have mercy on anyone who is truly needing help and goes to this facility!!!
J, E. N.|I was extremely disappointed in the care. NP was running behind and barely spent time with me going over my history. She made one suggestion that was not feasible for me. I brought in previous dr notes. I was told that they didn't treat headaches and migraines and that opioids were not prescribed in the office.  I explained that they work for me and how they help.

Message said to arrive 30 minutes early. Mkay, no problem. I leave my house THREE HOURS before my appointment (I live 2 hours from there). Mind you, this was my first time EVER driving to Greenville alone and I hate traffic. I run in to dozens of road construction sites, loads of traffic, and then arrive at my appointment at 1:32p. Receptionist is like ""yeah, we have to reschedule, you're late"".  I explain to her it wasn't my fault about the road work and everything else, only for her to reply ""well, you need to leave earlier then""! When I tell you I stormed out of that building and had to sit in my car for a good 20 minutes before leaving, and driving another 2ish hours..NEVER again.|Dr. Weaver is very nasty and unprofessional. I have a permanent thumb injury and possible nerve damage. I refused the injection because I've heard/seen bad reviews about it. He had the nerve to ask why did I come there! He lied and said that they didn't have my X-rays and said they couldn't give me pain medicine, then he just walked out without saying have a good day or nothing! Like how were you going to give me an injection If you didn't have my paperwork from my family doctor!! There's so much more but too much to type!

UPDATE!!! I just recently picked up my paperwork because I no longer wants to be a patient anymore and Dr. Weaver noted in my paperwork that ""he thinks I'm only there to seek narcotics"" all because I refused the injection! That makes me look terrible to others doctors! How can I fake an injury when you have my xray on file! There's always other options like I told him but nothing works! pain medicine is my only option smh. I just don't understand the discrimination. I've never failed a drug test under their contract! I've never been on drugs before !!!! I've been in so much pain. It's bad because doctors do not treat my pain because of what he noted! Wow, if that's what they think of us BLACK PEOPLE then I never want any pain medicine! I'm good!!!!|If you are on any benzos for anxiety or PTSD, etc he will not treat you until you have passed 3 clean urine test over 3 months. he will have you sign a contract that only he can prescribe you meds when he doesn't prescribe meds. this doctor is ONLY INTERESTED IN GIVING SHOTS. I've had 2 or 3 different kinds and they did not work. his answer was bc the other Drs who gave me the shots were not sophisticated in that area. so when I asked what was the success rate of his proposed treatment he didn't have a definitive answer. it was a rabbit hole conversation. I do not recommend going here. it was a waste of time and money. shots are big business and they do not work for everyone. but imo if you have insurance I'm not sure that part matters.
*IF EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT, HOW CAN THIS DR PRESCRIBE THE SAME TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE? UNLESS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PERSON BUT ABOUT THE MONEY. IMO.|My experience with National Spine and Pain center was excellent. Dr Weaver was great very nice man very professional. The receptionist was so nice and sweet but Nurse Erica, she was awesome she was very nice and caring and she made me feel so at ease after my procedure. Just so you know, Nurse Erica you Rock!|The staff is always very friendly. The check-in and check-out process is handled quickly. I'm always called back not long after I arrive. It's nice to not have to sit around and wait at a doctor's office. They always listen to what I have going on and try to help me as much as possible. I highly recommend them!|The staff and Doctors have always treated me with respect and have listened to what I have to say. The check in and out process is quick and easy. Have always had a pleasant experience. The wait times have not been an issue, Called back on time or before appointment time. Have been going here for years and have never had an issue that they haven't been able to work out.|I wish I could say I had been treated fairly and listened to, but that wasn't the case. The doctor didn't listen to any of the facts(proven) and surprisingly wasn't well versed on treatments for my conditions or alternate medication options. He left me with no option knowing that I can barely even function at home. He instead told me to continue with what I've been doing even though I told him it was unbearable as is and that was why I had sought further treatment. I have well documented conditions. I've been in different versions of pain management for almost half my life. He wasn't even willing to work with me.

I feel a large part was because he knew I had no money which is why I went so I could get control of my pain and work again. Usually if you're not able to do the shots/ nerve blocks/ procedures side of things there, you are not accepted because that and drug tests are how they make their money. So if you have hope that they will help you get your life back together, squash it now before they do. Now I don't know what to do because pain management was my only option for a life. He literally didn't care that I'd be homeless if if I couldn't get my pain under control to get a job. Where the compassion and understanding?|I have never had any of the experiences that the other reviewers have posted.  My mother, 94, was a patient and was given respect and courtesy at all times.  The doctor spent time with us and made us feel like my mother was the only patient he had and never rushed her.  We usually were seen in a timely manner, and always had positive interactions with the staff. The treatment she received helped decrease her pain in the last weeks of her life.  The only reason that I give four instead of five stars is because the bathroom is handicap accessible, but not easily so, as is the front door.

I should have been a better advocate for myself - my mistake.
I finally got a third injection that did work and I was scheduled for a follow up appointment on a Tuesday at 3:20. My babysitter called me the Sunday before my Tuesday appointment and needed to cancel for the week (I have five kids 7 and under that I didn't want to bombard a clinic with). I didn't call to cancel the follow-up appointment on Sunday since the office would be closed but I called at 8am Monday morning to cancel for Tuesday afternoon. I was told that I would incur a $50 late fee and after speaking with the manager she said I should have called and left a message on Sunday so that it was 48hrs in advance. I asked when she would have received the message and she said ""this morning."".......So the information would have been received at the same time Monday morning regardless but you want me to pay you $50 to have one less non-productive patient on your schedule.

I went in with a history of having had cortisone injections which were at best a temporary solution, but experienced decreasing efficacy over time. Even though I told the PA that, they evidently didn't listen. In fact, he interrupted me twice as I was explaining him my admittedly complex history, and literally told me: ""I have to get through this form."" Mind you, I didn't talk to him for more than 5 minutes. What he basically was telling me was to shut up and just get an injection.

Also I have seen numerous doctors other than them and have had urine and blood tests at each of them and NOT ONCE have my tests come back with ANYTHING illegal yet supposedly twice in a row I tested positive for meth. I was told that if a positive result showed up LabCorp was supposed to do a second different test which would rule out anything I was prescribed that would cause a false positive. Apparently heag didn't feel it was necessary. Were you guys aware that among other prescription drugs that Vicks vaporub and some cold medicines will cause a false positive? I tried to tell them that and also informed them I had never tested positive for anything other than a small amount of thc. I occasionally use CBD gummies for pain. Rather than trying to resolve the issue Dr Dakwu kicked me out and gave me a paper with counseling recommendations. I would not recommend this place even to someone I disliked.|I've been coming to Heag Pain Management for 4 months and I must say I've had nothing but great experiences. The doctors and staff are extremely nice and caring. Doc addresses all your concerns and only strives for your best interest!|The Dr. and staff are very knowledgeable, and caring. They take the time to listen and make sure that you understand everything before leaving their establishment. I wouldn't want to be treated by any other Dr. but Dr. Dakwa and his amazing staff. What blessing it is that God allowed for me to find this clinic. Thank you all so much!!! Be Blessed|Dr. D is the best on time doctor that I have. He and his staff are super friendly and professional. Thank you for being my doctor. Happy New Year|I'm so very grateful to have an amazing doctor as Dr. Dakwa and his staff. My health began to get worst after I revealed to Dr. Robert Foster that my baby cousin was the one that was the serial killer that murdered the jogger and art gallery owner in Mecklenburg county. At one time I believed in Dr. Robert Foster because he once told me Mrs. Lopez I'm not just your doctor I'm your friend. I believe in him and this particular day I was in serious pain and remorseful of the suicide of my baby cousin . See they found him hanging in his jail cell. My advice to you come here to dr. Dakwa for your pain . I pray all the time that one day I will at least get 75 percent better. Dr. Dakwa I pray to God will get me there. I'm that confident in Dr. Dakwa. At Bethany I had to pay for 3 up to 4 hundred dollars per visits. Although I showed them my Medicaid and Medicare card. Im grateful for all Dr. Dakwa did he and his staff made sure that even how difficult Dr. Robert Foster made my end of life a living hell. I'm 61 years old with one working lung. I can't afford to die having Dr. Robert Foster which is impatent to practice anymore. Retire, die of go straight to hell or something Dr. Robert Foster cause I feel like you must have been in that prison cell torching my baby cousin.like the guards that took his life.  I don't need any doctor at all like Dr. Robert Foster, his nurse Channel nor the  CMA Quinn for that matter. I have a beautiful life. My husband and I have endured enough hardship over the past 28 years of marriage to last 1000 marriages put together. I have one working lung and my husband 15 years my senior almost lost his life to COVID in 2020 the month of December. We are nesters and all our children are grown and gone except our 23 year on. Therefore we really need good doctors. Cause this son of ours born 1 month and 3 days before the twin towers attack. We have a 3 year old grandson. I have to prove to his mom I can hold him in my arms without dropping him. That's to Dr. Dakwa he made it finally happen. Thank you Dr. Dakwa and your staff.
Warm regards,Angela Lopez CNA First Responder|My husband is a patient here I find that the doctor is very tentative to his needs he cares about his patience I recommend this doctor to anyone kudos to you keep up the good work.|Dr Dakwa is an excellent doctor but his staff I think he need to change some of those secretaries or the people that work at the front desk. Because not only my appointment was at 10:00 a.m. I didn't leave there until after 2:00. Everybody was gone in the office no one's there but me and Mr Randall. They completely forgot about me. I believe 4 hours in a doctor office is way too long especially for someone with the pet kind of pain that I'm in. When I went to give a urine sample. I went back to my room and the computer head froze which needed a pen to get in it so that was another 45 minutes I had to wait before someone could open my note pad back up. I had to start over in the beginning with my paperwork on the tablet. I believe there should also be someone there to help you to use the tablet there are people that has vision issues like me and also cognitive issues like me.. I'm not giving out any insults I'm only given these statements so that Doctor Dakwa can be aware and better improve his office, staff as well as his personnel so everyone can have a shorter visit.",2025-01-27|2025-02-27|2024-12-19|2024-09-09|2025-01-07|2024-10-09|2025-01-04|2024-08-03,5|1|5|5|5|5|5|4,,,"11 a.m.|10 a.m.|12 p.m.",56.8|56.4|52.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,short_wait_times|pain_management_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJP1cgrLwbU4gRE9dNXCMoQzU,118

They take great care of me every time I am there. However I have had problems with the hospital who carries out of the procedure authorizations dropped the ball with me. They had 5 weeks to submit my referral for my next procedure and they waited until the Friday before my appointment which was early Monday.  I had to call my insurance company just hours before and all they could do was put in a note of urgency. Thankfully I got a call saying it was approved with enough time to make it to my appointment. It is my understanding that this is a far to frequent  occurance and it needs to be seriously addressed.  No one should be this stressed leading up to an appointment and this is a pain clinic for heavens sake. We are already stressed enough as it is.|I called to make an appointment (after having already left a voicemail and unsuccessfully trying to get ahold of them for a week), and was told that a doctor here denied my referral from my PCP.
Might have been good for someone to at least contact me and let me know about that as soon as possible, so I could have gone ahead and tried to get an appointment at a different doctor that's willing to see me.

**

Update: Around 2 hours after posting this, the office called me to tell me that they saw this review, and they said they're sorry I didn't understand that my PCP was supposed to have updated me.

My issue is that despite leaving a voicemail HERE a week ago, and continuing to try to call since then, I never got ahold of anyone until today-- only to ultimately be denied care and sent somewhere else. It just seems like my initial call, when I left a voicemail describing my situation, could have quickly and easily been returned before now, and I could have avoided spending the past week waiting.

When someone gives you critical feedback, the best response is perhaps not actually to call them and tell them they are wrong. Especially when you know that they are seeking care for chronic pain.|Yes, I echo the review by Kayla below, since we also spent weeks repeatedly calling this center, almost always getting a voicemail initially. To their credit, they did usually return calls within a day, but after finally being told we WOULD be notified of an appointment time by a certain date and NOT hearing anything on that date or the day after, and calling again repeatedly, we were eventually told the doctor denied our referral and that ""our doctor"" should have notified us? (At least three doctors were involved in the referral, so we don't even know which one they might have intended and why couldn't they just provide the details of why we were denied, or at least which doctor we should contact?) I echo Kayla's sentiments that there are much better ways to communicate more efficiently, compassionately, and completely, especially for a person already suffering from severe pain who has been specifically told to contact pain management for the ""best and most lasting solution"". Can't even get started on a solution at this place, but instead wasted weeks trying (literally a pain) . . .|I have had back pain since I was 20 years old now 71.

Then there is Dr Cunningham.   He listens.   Please understand I mean more than nodding and hearing the words.  He hears what you don't say too and has a gift to see the whole picture.   He is not a Dr who accepts the concept of 'it's the best we can do' or 'those are the only options '.  He will search and research and not give up on you as long as you don't give up on him.
Once I was told that unfortunately all the pain clinic had were bandaids.  Well their 'bandaids' have given me my quality of life back more than once, and they are working to do it again.  That's more than many other Dr's have done, combined.

If you are in search of a simple source of narcotic pain meds, go somewhere else where the Dr's don't care.  If you want your life back from pain, solutions that may include some medication but with a more permanent solution as the hopeful end goal, go to Southeast Pain Care in Valdese.  You will not regret it.|I love Dr. Cunningham; he is the best doctor ever. He specializes in pain management, and that is what he assisted me with. He has helped me so much. I would never have trusted a doctor with my procedures except him. He listens to me every time and makes sure I am comfortable before having them done. I do not really remember much during the procedures because of the medication he gives me for my nerves. People say back shots and knee shots hurt, but they do not with Dr. Cunningham; he is the best. He not only is an amazing Dr but he really cares about his patients and listen to you where most others do not. His team is also amazing and I love them all. I had blood clots in my leg and my whole leg was solid red and It was absolutely killing me. I had went to my regular doctor and a vain dr both said just let it desolve on its own there is nothing we can give you for it now but when Dr Cunningham saw how red my leg was and swollen he said oh my Vivian have they gave you any antibiotics because that's infection I said no and he prescribed me the medication and by the next day my leg felt much better. That is why I love Dr Cunningham he is the best|He has saved my Life and since my July surgery of the Spinal Stimulator I have been able to have a major improvement and not be bed bound anymore. He's the best in the game . And has a Big heart considering that soon I will be able to walk without any assistance.|Dr Cunningham is very professional and great at his job.  He listens well snd wants to fo the best for you.|Love Dr Cunningham and his staff. Always very nice and Dr Cunningham does a great job with my injection.|Today was my first time seeing Dr. Cunningham. He replaced Dr. Sullivan who retired.  Having driven a city bus for 30 years my pain issues are quite severe.  Dr. Cunningham administered my pain medication injections and I barely felt the needle.  He is both professional and completely understanding of my pain needs and I highly recommend his services!!

Dr. Bertrand is a one of the most caring doctors I've seen in a while. She has helped keep my pain managed and for that i thank her. The staff is nice and polite. Thank you National Pain and Spine|the staff is ridiculously friendly!!! I've had several RFA procedures on both my knees with a different DR at another practice. this is the first time I've had the procedure numbed for me! I can not say enough about how different that makes the process of this procedure!!! she simply told me that I shouldn't have to feel the pain of that part and that she didn't like causing pain. I don't think I've been more grateful for a DR! And she was VERY knowledgeable about the procedure!!! im very grateful for my referral here!|I've Been Going To Intervention Pain/ National Spine For 12 Years and I Still Do But It's Really Terrible For Patients, the Atmosphere Is Tense And It's Just People Who Have Been Fired and Terminated.

AND I SUFFER.. BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENCE. ARROGANT, OFFICE MANAGEMENT!??|Dr. Bertrand is AMAZING. She has helped me tremendously over the last few months, and has listened politely to all my questions and concerns. She is honest, and has been extremely professional this entire time. I would leave a 5 star review, however, I have called multiple times throughout the month and they've only answered the phone twice. I have left messages and they ask you only leave one, but they never call back. It's extremely frustrating and I hope it can be fixed.|I'm a prior cancer patient, and after all the treatment my body was left pretty beat up. This clinic is by far the BEST pain management clinic in N.C. The rules you must follow are clear, and the ENTIRE staff listens. Dr. Bertrand genuinely cares for her patients - she doesn't treat us like we are just a number. She's caring, thoughtful, and truly wants what's best for her patients. Ms. Brenda always greets me by name and runs a tight ship. She's amazing, and I never have to wait longer than 15 minutes from my appointment time. When I come out she has my next appointment ready to go. By far the smoothest running clinic I've ever been to. I HIGHLY recommend this clinic if you genuinely suffer from chronic pain.|Do not walk but run away! This is the worst run practice I have ever seen and I have worked in the medical profession for years. I was ordered an MRI over 6 months ago and they will not get insurance approval for me to get it done. My orthopedist can do it in under 24 hours. This is not the first time for this either nor am I the only patient this is happening too. The PA's openly lie to patients. The list goes on and on but I am tired of typing. Just listening to the other patients in the waiting room talk is scary enough. There are signs in the exam rooms threatening expulsion for recording your visit, that should be a huge red flag to anyone. Why would they be afraid of this if everything was being done properly.|Dr Bertrand is truly a wonderful lady and and even better Dr. One that genuinely cares which is an unfortunately rate trait from my experiences. She listens, gives honest feedback, and wants you to get better. She should be cloned, or at the least, new DRs and PAs should be required to learn from her on how to be decent human beings n physicians. I honestly can't say enough about great job she does, from treatment to just listening to her patients. I hope everyone that sees this had a Dr Bertrand in their life!!!
Again she deserves countless raises and awards for what she does and the amazingly wonderful Dr/person that she is. A gift just to meet her|IM  not being seen on time or in  order of mynappointment since the departure of the Spring Lake PA that left to spend more times with his kids.
Last month 3 people who came in after me who appointment was after mine was seen before me.  I was there almost two hours I brought it to the attention of the Dr.
Today I was there an Hour and forty five minutes my husband brought it to attention to the young lady who worked the front desk she said only one person but believe she was mistaken it was actually 2 for sure maybe 3. My husband and I know they young lady up front  catches it and she actually a very nice professional member of Staff so are all the Dr's Ive seen.  All I want is to be treated fair to be seen on time in order then if it takes longer I understand. Treat me like you would like someone to treat you or your family member.

Appointments are quick with no waiting more than 10 minutes!|I've been coming here for 5 years and have seen all 3 doctors. They are all fantastic. I seen so many doctors before finally being referred to CPC. They did tests that were never suggested before to find and pinpoint my problems. They go above and beyond to work with you about what's best for your particular issues. The staff is also wonderful.  So grateful I found this clinic.|My mother, who had lung cancer, was referred here.  She was in a great deal of pain, and women of her generation, suffer in silence.  Radiation, surgery, chemo, cancer, caused her tremendous pain.
She had seen pain management doctors in Greenville, but they were of little help.
Dr. Swiber was outstanding.  He said that he would do whatever was needed to make her pain free and increase her quality of life.  He was a true blessing.|I must say both me and my wife go here and for my wife who has been told for years to just deal with pain the Dr's here have helped her. Dr.Jason Mcneese and other staff have been great. She has so many back issues that make her daily life unlivable, they have helped her be able to enjoy life again. As for myself I am a disabled veteran and they have helped me so much I got my life back. We thank you all at Carolina Pain Center.|I have been to two other Pain Doctors before coming here. Both were unresponsive when it came to answers and treatments. On my first trip i met with Jason (PA) and he was great. He did a couple of test to figure out my source of pain. I was never given any tests like this at any other place i went. He was friendly and knew what he was talking about. They scheduled a steroid shot in the same week. Where in the past i would have to wait a month or two. The day of the shot i was greated by Doc Swiber who made the experience of the shot better by humor. After a few days i got a call by the staff of Doc Swiber office asking how i was feeling. Due to the friendliness of this practice and how they treat their patients. I will be recommending this place for my friends amd family.|This place had me attend four appointments before telling me that they didn't take my insurance for the actual procedure. I don't understand how they would do the injections and then not do my procedure. I do not recommend this place because they should have told me in the first place that they didn't take my insurance. This is as a waste of my time. I had to take personal leave from my work so now I won't be able to spend quality time with my family during the holidays because I had to waste leave days for attending appointments that eventually did nothing for my injury/disability. The receptionist also seemed clueless on how to do the most simple task on the computer. When I needed all appointments for my job they had no idea how to pull up all appointments to give to me I have no respect for this Clinic.|With all my medical conditions, surgeries, and test. I've seen far too many doctors to know that to find a great Dr like Dr Swiber is extremely hard. So when you do find them you make sure you realize there aren't many doctors around this knowledgeable, and caring. So don't screw it up and take advantage of him. Because when you get dropped as a patient and think you will find another doctor with the same knowledge and this caring... You'll be begging him up to take you back as a patient. I've seen Dr Swiber for a few years now. This man is kind, caring, and understanding. He's not looking to just see patient after patient after patient just write scripts for narcotics and send you on your way. He (Swiber) genuinely cares, he explains his thoughts, concerns, symptoms, treatment option, the works... he will go through it all with you. He will tell you what he thinks will work for you and your conditions. If you were thinking of a different approach to help you. You just discuss it and come to a common ground. So if you're just looking for drugs find a different doctor. If you're really in pain and you need help. He will be the man to see. After 20 + doctors, 10 + surgeries over the last 5 years alone. Plus countless others prior. All the workers compensation doctors, evaluations, and functional capacity exams/evaluations. This doctor is by far the best and I will be his patient until he retires. If you happen to read this Doc. You and your staff are amazing. Everyone at both of your offices are great and I know that you are wearing off on them. In a great way. Thank you so much!!!!

Rude staff and also a lying staff. Will not respond to voicemails and will say they do. Also impossible to get ahold of the nursing staff! Please do not go here!|I only moved here 2 1/2 months ago and I've been on paid medication for 21 years. I was very nervous and worried that due to all of the restrictions and rules relating to pain medication I would have a really hard time finding a doctor that would take on a new patient and listen to me and prescribe only what I need to function daily. I went to Carolina Pain and Weight Loss and saw Dr. Lauren Murphy and what a blessing it was. Dr. Murphy set and listened to me for a good amount of time, asking me very good questions, letting me ask questions while devising a strategy to help me. She didn't make me feel like she had to hurry me out  because she had other patients or she already had in mind what she was going to do before she even talked to me, to me these are traits of a very good doctor. Also the staff including the nurse who helps her are absolutely awesome they really are. I wish I could remember the nurses name because she as well as Dr. Murphy have made me feel at home, have really helped me and have been so very kind. I am so very grateful for Dr. Murphy and her nurse and would like to thank both and I would 100% highly recommend Dr. Murphy for your medical care. This truly is a great medical facility.|I have been coming here for about two years. The nurse practitioner was wonderful. The owner however, who is also a nurse practitioner (CarolynDavis) doesn't belong in the medical profession. She sees every patient as a revenue stream to pay for her light blue Porsche. Judgemental, absolutely no empathy for the well-being of the people her staff sees, incompetent in the NP field. This was made clear on more than one occasion. Most recently after wasting MY time for 90 mins to misdiagnose my needs and I refused to pay the $25 to correct the previous appointment. Instructed her staff to NOT render care because of it. This is NOT anyone you want to trust with any part of your health. You are simply a revenue stream. Steer clear. I feel for her staff that clearly see what I see on a daily basis.She will be getting a formal complaint with the NC Nursing Board this very afternoon.|So originally my experience here was excellent Dr. Amy really seemed to get me and care about my treatment...then even though I never failed a drug test and always complied they ""dismissed me"" because a pharmacist slandered me... she called her up and told her I was abusing xtampa (a medicine you can't even abuse) and that I told her ""but don't tell me dr"" like anyone would ever say that. Currently suing that girl and Publix pharmacy over slander and defamation of character ... later found out the pharmacist was sleeping with my now ex and when I yelled at her for flirting with him right in front of me she decided to take revenge and call  my dr. And LIED. Well Carolina pain and weight loss took her accusations seriously and dismissed me without even letting me know, hearing my side ... even though my dr admitted her claims didn't make sense since you can't abuse xtampa as it's  tamper proof... Then and here's the worst they agreed to take me back as a patient but would only prescribe me Belbuca which I couldn't afford my dr. Started treating me like a drug seeker and told me that everyone has pain and I need to deal with it. Then Even though I was still a patient they refused my multiple calls to set up my next appointment... so my doctor basically abandoned me after promising me care! and also refused to fill my medicine that she had already called in for me! , I recently found out through a better doctor, a specialist is scapuology that I have a serious injury where a fascial tear is causing all the other muscle on my shoulder and back to overcompensate so my shoulder doesn't basically fall off! My  great new doc told me my options are: surgery to oversew the tissue and my rhomboids or start micronized stem cell therapy or PRP therapy to try to regrow my scapular fascia...now i have a real diagnosis and treatment  to go along with pharmacology (which my doctor says even with these therapies I may need to continue the rest of my life :(....but at Carolina pain and weigh loss after the incident with the lying pharmacist they just started to  treated me like a drug seeker (which I am not and never have been) and told me ""everyone deals with pain"" that I needed to ween of the medication and just deal with pain like everyone else does... Yes you heard that right they told a chronic pain patient that my pain is the same as theirs...I can't believe they showed so little compassion and now that i have a real diagnosis (not provided by them) I am so angry since they ripped me off my meds and showed 0 compassion while I have been suffering deeply. By the way they made me pay all this money for drug tests that my insurance company covers and refused me treatment if I didn't pay and then Next Day... discharge! Horrible horrible place do not go here.|I did not have a positive experience at this center. I paid $600 dollars for the HCG diet and honestly it was a total waste of money. They basically hand you some HCG diet book (you can find more useful info on online blogs for free), the first 7 injections, and push you out the door. Every 7 days when I went for my ""check ins"" I felt rushed and this vibe like they really could care less about your overall success. You don't even see a doctor you see what I assume is a nurse each follow up. I saw the doctor once very briefly the day they take your full payment. But each follow up a nurse injects you, takes your weight, and sends you on your way. For the large amount of money you pay I expected a lot more from this center. My 2nd visit I had some major concerns and they sent in the clinics receptionist/sales lady to address my concerns after I asked to speak to the doctor. Totally unacceptable.They don't even call to confirm your next follow up appointments weekly. I will say I lost 15lbs in 3 weeks. However, I have gained it all back very quickly. After my last set of injections I never even got so much as a call from this clinic to follow up. You're suppose to get 3 months of ""support"" with that fee paid. After my 3 weeks and finishing my first ""round"" of injections I stopped going. I have not heard a word from them since. Not even a phone call about why I never returned. Very disappointed and I would never refer anyone to this clinic or to the HCG diet.|I went here in 2010 they treated me poorly did not explain they're active and I was out on alot of medicine much more than us expected or imagined I could've needed I've battled my addiction on and since.  I have legitimate issues but chose to remove myself from the clinics scene all together for many years now that I'm older and informed I am seeking my service pain clinic again who treated me well and with kindness and listened to me and my needs not told me my needs from day 1 and overwhelming my system with too many types of medications and way to high doses of the medications. I'm glad the DEA took action the Dr I saw here Dr fohr is no longer with them and I'm glad to hear it cuz she never once asked me what I wanted she just threw a bunch of medication at me and I hope that's not how they practice things there in general or that was just how she practice things there. I hope the corruption had been dealt with.|This is the Best  Pain Doctors office I have ever been to. I have been going to them for 4 years. Carolyn and Jennifer,  and the whole staff are very attentive and compassionate.
I have been to 6+ pain Dr.'s before I found this place. I had some REALLY BAD EXPERIENCES TOO ie; balls thrown at me, excessive intrusive ? about my marriage and then said that my marriage was going to end. Another one said I was crazy and it's all in my head. Still others only wanted money. I have all the medical records to show what was wrong. The first time I got help was with Ms.Tina Kiwajaski P.A. She helped me then she left. I was able to get a recommendation from her to here.

They're helpful and try to do whatever  they can to get your pain under control.  Mrs. Carolyn treated me so kind. I had come to her because my previous Dr. refused to listen and was syco. analysing me. I  was not seeing him for that. It started getting worse from  there. Thankfully I  got recommend to this office and now I'm so excited to help others find  an EXCELLENT LEVEL OF CARE.
They also  do medical weight  management My husband is having great success with this service. He has lost 6 inches of his waistline and all over his body.

I have read some other post that are bashing this practice. I  know that everyone has a right to tell there story. I can say they DO NOT put up with people  faking and drug seeking. They pull your records and are if you are lieing. They will  dismiss you if you're going to  multiple third-party places in order to  get more pain medication ie; E.R.  urgent care or hospital.  With so many people trying to cheat the system it affects  people who really need HELP. Carolyn,  and Jennifer,  are trying to getting you  on the Best medication for  your  pain. I have had 2 knee replacement and they HELPED ME. Jennifer  McLain worked  with my surgeon to keep me as pain free as possible. And the process takes time, "" this is not Burger King,"" it's  medical pain management. It takes time to  find what works! It is a process that can take time. If you have financial constraints talk about and just be honest. They will do there best to help you find a cost effective way to afford your pain medication.|I love the people who work there.

Didn't get my back shot yesterday. Missed a FULL DAYS WORK for a follow up appointment. Really! This clinic is the worst.
The appointment was supposed to be for my back shots. Then they told me my authorization wasn't in cause I said I'd wait to see if they could still get me in to get my back shot.  I'm there already.  Im in mad pain can't think it. !!!  Went straight to the VA they confirmed my auth was in since Aug 6. I just got my neck shot last week. Liers!!!
And that took forever to get my neck shot, doc request neck x-ray. That didn't put thru. My VA doc had to put in the request. Then that took n act of God for the clinic to confirm they finally  got the x-ray.
The staff is excellent to deal with.  Their process stink a**!!!!  I'm so done with them.  Finding another pain clinic.   EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED|Edit: The helpful staff were suddenly fired and/or quit. The clinic is no longer in business.

This place has saved my life. If you are truly suffering, they will listen, they will help. Laura Liston is incredibly knowledgeable and her passion for helping patients is commendable. The staff is great as well, I've been treated exceptionally at every visit, by all staff, for several years now. The lower ratings are not deserved. The clinic has rule rules, as do as any place of business, but when you are on controlled medication, these rules can save your life. Expect urine and blood screening, pill counting (to ensure that you are not selling the meds or taking too much) and these checks are for trust. Some people have problems with these rules and get very upset when the doctors enforce them. Then, they jump online to voice their unhappiness. Follow the rules, as they are safeguards for your life, and I hope you receive relief from your pain. - Samantha|I reviewed them after my first visit. Dr. Aranoff is the best, he spent so much time with me. Every month I go in and see the nurse practitioners, who spend an hour with me talking, checking vitals, they are more thorough and caring about my health than any dr. I've ever gone  to. I never have to wait.
Plus if I need to talk to someone in their office or have them send a form, they answer immediately and do everything immediately.
And no,  I don't work for them or are related,they are just that good.
Also front desk people and other nurses are friendly and wonderful|All I have to say is yikes on bikes! I've been a patient now for over 4-5 years. I strictly see dr.a and love him to pieces. The office staff however will make you spit nails. I called in after being told by Dr.A I needed to have them fix my appointment times as the ones they have randomly given me aren't conducive to my personal life. When I explained this I was told it didn't matter because it was telemedicine....it does matter, at the time they have decided to randomly move my appointments to as to when I have always scheduled my appointments is when I'm getting my kiddo from school and cannot do a telemedicine appointment. When explaining this to whomever was on the other end of the phone she copped a massive attitude and hung up on me because I told her I always had my
Appointments in the morning and that's where they needed to stay for my schedule. It wasn't April it was someone else in the office. I've told many people about the amazing care Dr.A has given me over the years and I'm thankful for his care, I am super turned off by the office staff and their attitude. Thank you Dr.A for amazing care, PLEASE for the love of all that's holy get better and well trained office staff . The ones in the office now make me cringe when  I call in to fix an issue.|Dr Aronoff couldn't be bothered to care for his patients. He often went to lunch but didn't return until several hours later. Most everything was handled by his inciopient staff. When I called to ask when my next appointment is, they hung up. Didn't know the answer or where to dumb to help
Paul Fagan was great. He listed to me an ordered my prescriptions.
Aronoff didn't pay for anything like healthcare overtime travel or anything else. He is a stingy old man|The only reason I gave two stars is that the PAs and nurses work really hard.

Problems:
The front office staff is horrible.  Their turn over is extreme there's probably 20 different receptionists over the years.  They are rarely experienced and obviously not trained well.
They will hang up on you.  Threaten to put you on the Drug abusers list.   Been called a drama queen and a lier.  Messages do NOT get passed on to the doctors in a timely fashion.
More than one patient has come into the office while I was there upset sometimes crying because  no one fixed their
Prescription.  I've had my appointments rescheduled to different days, times, and doctors without notice.

The Pain Clinic
It's uncomfortable to sit in the lobby.
Vitals, drug tests, getting chats always seems to happen almost as an afterthought.
The nurses are ok.  But they never return calls anything medical that you may have called about.  Instead, it's all relayed through the front office.   Frustrating and time-consuming to get answers.
More than once  I've been in the
Elevator and overheard the staff discussing a patient by name.

The clinic does do not have an on-call doctor or emergency line.  Which is a big deal when to write your prescription wrong and you have to wait through a weekend or holiday.

A few years ago I made it to the zero copay part of my Insurance in early spring.  They charged me a copay for months.  I was never reimbursed.  The only reason they stopped charging me is that my insurance sent them a letter.

Dr. Aronoff
He's either in a great mood or a horrible one.  When he's in a bad mood you are barely allowed to talk, he makes decisions about your care without getting your agreement.  If you complain then he will threaten to discharge you.
If he's in a good mood he may let you get one or two thoughts in.  He will not talk about more than one pain problem at a time.  I have four different issues that cause me pain. He only notates one and your records end up looking like your other pain problems aren't an issue.

Good Points about the clinic
I here for a couple of reasons love the PAs.  They are intelligent, well-informed, caring people.
The office does not routinely do injections.  I react horribly to injections and have had issues with pain doctors strong-arming me into doing one anyway so I can get something to ease the pain.
Dr. Aronoff really does know his stuff when it comes to pain.  If your case interest him he can be a great asset.|I've been a patient here since around 2019... Everything was ok until COVID. I've sent the drug tests back every time they sent one and went there, over an hour drive, multiple times. Always passed the drug screens. Well, today I called to find out when my next appointment is, they informed me that I have Missed 2 scheduled drug screens. Mind you, these are appointments that they just MADE FOR ME, without even contacting me. Anyway, I'm out of medicine and they say they can't see me for 6 more days!!! So, there goes 7 years of ""sobriety"". Thanks alot for the push to relapse. I can't go 6 days without my med, I have to work to support my family. I can't do that without my med. I would never recommend this place. Very unprofessional staff. After 3 years of going here, they just screwed my whole life up.|Went here for well over 2 years and had a great experience. The past 2 times I went they told me my urine was positive for morphine. The first time I figured it was something on their end, but the second time (a week later) had me very concerned. And of course they didn't believe me when I said I didn't take anything. I went straight to my pcp after the second visit and my urine did NOT have morphine. I also took an at home test which was clean. I truly believe that lady who handles the urine either wanted me gone or just didn't handle the cups correctly. I voluntarily stopped going here.",2024-08-17|2018-04-17|2018-01-25|2022-01-03|2023-01-21|2019-09-24|2022-05-25|2017-03-31,2|5|5|2|3|2|1|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Did Dr. Okonneh pass away","Okonneh is a Dr from a completely different pain practice Mr. Akers I think you posted on the wrong office.",telemedicine_available|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJjcsiGvGfVogR_UYPZ-Kb2tk,34

UNC accepts this company's insurance and they DO cover other patients throughout the UNC system. When Dr Mauck found out I applied for a loan to pay for this procedure he found a colleague that he would use himself. This then may be covered by my insurance or cost me much less due to administration fees. That is a doctor that cares for his patients not his wallet.|WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
They lied about my records from 4yrs in pain management from Texas. The doctor here told me I had repeatedly asked for my Rx to be called in early to the TX clinic. Funny thing, though, one of the rules of the TX clinic was that you had to have an appointment every 30 days to get a new paper prescription. When I brought this fact up, the Dr said she had proof, but would not let me see said proof. So, I ended up in the hospital extremely sick shortly after moving here.|If I could give 0 stars I would do that...this place is a joke I deal with chronic back pain I also have degenerative disc disease, and from what 10 other doctors at UNC told me I have the back of a 60 year old man (I'm only 29) and will be in a wheelchair by the time I'm 40, they sent me in for another MRI, and the PA  looked over an image of my spine (which after seeing 4 different images of my spine I knew it wasn't mine) she proceeded to tell me that there is nothing work with my back and that it must have magically healed even though I was barely able to walk.she gave me muscle relaxers and I told her they were not working then basically called me a junky in front of my daughter and wife even though I told her I didn't want narcotics and wanted them to explore different treatments even though they never once discussed any type of treatments to begin with. This place is very bad especially for having to be on a waiting list for 12 months minimum before being seen it is not worth your time and they will not help you nor discuss any treatment options with you.|I am a 14 year Army veteran, who was looking for a second opinion on the way my pain management, and procedures had been going. I currently have a pain management who has not used current CDC guidelines regarding chronic pain management. So when my wife sent UNC my records, MRI's, and previous pain management findings they suggested that we come and check them out they have different treatments to try. So we get to the initial visit after 40 minutes of paperwork I see a PA there that basically tells me that they don't know what they can do for me. Then she brings the DR in here is where things got strange. The DR wouldn't tell us what method or how they would even go about testing and treating me ( refused to say anything) to the point of her words "" I am not going to tell you"". My wife and I have been to a couple of these places so far so we looked at each other and had our answer right after she said that. But the icing on the cake was the fact that I was not a patient yet but before I left that day the wanted a urine sample from me. I guess the fact that I have long hair, a moustache, and beard threw all that "" hey we really think we can help "" to the reality of what the actual visit was. I would not recommend this place to anybody, the administration staff was great and friendly but the DR I saw was a clown shoe and incompetent.",2022-04-16|2024-11-21|2024-08-12|2023-10-12|2023-05-04|2021-07-20|2018-01-22|2016-06-09,1|5|1|1|5|1|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",64.2|53.8|49,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ39GNmLLDrIkRKNDUuIhbU_k,31

I went there about 7 or 8 years ago maybe and it was a totally different story back then you waited for three or four hours just to be seen and then a lot of times they only wanted to offer you injections and yes if you have your chance to see Dr November or the female doctor there she's not a doctor excuse me the female nurse practitioner see Dr Novembre she seems to me like she just wants to kind of get you in and out and when she does talk to you she likes to change your medicine from what the actual doctor has you on at least I've heard she's never tried to change me so I only see Dr Novembre unless absolutely necessary|Sometimes they're a little slow and they are a little behind there but the doctor that does all the injections is well worth the wait!!

Dr Scott has been taking care of me since 2006. The treatments and medication he has offered have been very helpful. It hasn't taken all the pain away, but it has certainly helped to reduce my pain about 50%. He and his staff have always shown high respect to me and willing to see me and make changes quickly.

They will not make a change before your next about no matter how bad you hurt or if the medication that they changed you to is ineffective. They are nasty. The nurses have hung up on me. Avoid this clinic. I had a family emergency they refused to help me and left me without meds for a month and I went through withdrawal. I have been to other pain clinics and was treated much better.|I went 3-4 time, a different story every time i went , another shot, I felt like a pin cushion, they did nothing to help me, after my last injection, (shot) they said don't come back, go see a neurosurgeon, which they didn't recommend are suggested a neurosurgeon, but a neurosurgeon in Greenville recommend them ,so I was on my own, I personally wouldn't recommend this firm are medical doctors. So I am see a neurosurgeon in Chesapeake Va. So far test show nerves damage.

You'll see a different NP every visit, no continuity of care whatsoever.  They'll let you run out of medicine and not call anything in (even when you were just there the day prior).  Don't bother if you're in any REAL pain because they'll just give you Bup and act like it's supposed to help.|I have been going there for two years. They have my previous records from FL. Rather than giving what I was on in FL. They have giving everything else. Saying it's a regiment with my insurance. Same insurance from FL. They want you to be a Ginny pig. I'm so over this place. I need to find a new place. I'm calling my insurance and see if I drive 14 hrs will they pay the bill. This ridiculous. I was given injections in FL and was always  put to sleep. Minor anesthesia for the Dr was great. Here because they don't prescribe that medication. But everything that has been given is a waste of pharmacy go pay. I've paid more money for stuff that doesn't work. Everything that have prescribed I interferes with my migraines or gives more problems. I'm really upset I'm beginning to think it's a racial thing. Everyone is not drug seekers.|I met with Dr. Nunez from this facility. She was very informative and she was nice as hell to me. My appointment was the last one for the day , but instead of rushing the appointment she took her time with me. She asked me how I would like to go about handling my pain and she made suggestions. My boyfriend went with me and he also said she was a nice doctor. I'm glad to have met her and I am looking forward to future visits.

Update 
So my last appointment with her was awful. She wouldn't see me because I got new insurance and she said they weren't gonna pay her for my visit so she was not gonna see me. Before I had no health insurance and I was paying her. I couldn't afford it anymore so she just left me with no meds or appt and while my daughter was there. How unprofessional.|I've been going to this pain clinic sense 2015 and I've never had any bad experiences. The staff is excellent the environment and the atmosphere has been very professional but kind everybody is shown the best level of care. From my first visit until the last appointment nothing but courtesy. I'm an patient that has a appointment every 3 months. Each visit has been the same. The physician Dr. Nunez is a beautiful, compassionate individual. She has a very soothing spirit and always words of comfort and grace.|We moved my 88 yr old mom here to Brookdale Assisted Living a few months ago and needed to continue her care here. We mainly chose this pain clinic as it was right across the street from Brookdale. It ended up being a great choice! This facility and its staff have been super to work with from the get go. Transferring moms current pain management regime from her Raleigh Dr to here was seamless. All of the staff involved in moms visits have been engaged and thoughtful and professional and personable in assessing and addressing her chronic pain management needs. They have made her feel comfortable and understood as her pain needs change.
We would recommend this clinic highly!|Im truly disappointed I'm my doctor's here. Number 1 they have repeatedly given me meds I'm allergic to. I have to take benadryl with it.

I have severe medical conditions, am in constant pain and see multiple doctors a week. I have never seen such incompetence. I had an epidural scheduled for months! I drove  an hour to this appointment only to be turned away because they got the wrong prior authorization. Dr. Kim stood in front of me with no emotion uncaring and said it's the insurance's fault. I use to work at a doctors office and when I did prior authorizations I always checked to make sure it matched so that way I didn't waste the patients time. Then he proceeded to say it was my doctors fault for writing the notes wrong! So what is it? Did my doctor mess up, is someone just not doing their job, or does Dr. Kim have so many patients he doesn't care about the individual. Needless to say I will not be back to Pine Hurst! I can't get my time and money back so thanks a lot! And I'm still in extreme pain!|Every appointment I feel like I am treated with Dignity and Respect. My Dr. Bradley Hicks is amazing. If there is a reacting  and new pains he is quick to find solutions. The nursing staff are Amazing as well. They are always filled with fun and Laughter even Early in the morning|Since Dr. Corrigan retired, the office staff and office manager run the facility with no compassion or care for the patient. I have been going there for 15 years and I have seen patients cry and feel violated. I was short $5.00 for a payment. I told the rude secretary I would go to the car and pay her after my appointment. She treated me like a criminal and insisted I go to my car for the $5.00 . I was running late for my appointment and I was sick.  With that said,  I was angry with how she treated me and made some  unflattering remarks. The office manager approached me , got in my face and said leave. She didn't want nto hear my side of how this secretary has no manners or social skills.  All they care about is money.  I am doing everything I can to pay my co-pay.  Times are financially difficult and  five dollars was no reason to insist I go back to my car for the money. She acted like I was lying and embarrassed me in the office. I would never go back to that money hungry office. The office manager is a power monster and made a fool of herself.             I have to compliment Dr. Hicks.  He is an angel

The staff does not communicate and work well with the Dr. I was there yesterday and a pt was left alone in the middle of a treatment ans was yelling for help when she woke up. 3 people went running to the room and shortly after all 3 came out, YES they left the pt alone again. I have had issues with prescriptions being sent to the correct pharmacy. More than once!

I would like to add that I asked the receptionist as to why was the pt and whoever accompanying the pt was coming out from the back but I was told due to Covid numbers I would not be able to go back with my husband......"" Well they are both pts!"".....then the women in the back proceeded to talk about me as if the windows and walls are thick and I can't hear them. So professional!|i've been going to Solas for 4 years now & i've gotta say how much i appreciate the staff & doctor Johnson. they all are truly caring & amazing people who work there. sometimes i have to take my kids & they never have any issues, they adore my boys & treat them with kindness, very welcoming & also keep an eye on them too! i just really wish the best for all the staff at Solas Health! if i could put 10 's i definitely would!|Always a great experience at Solace Health.

I have zero hesitation referring other patients who struggle with chronic pain to Solas Health.|Solas Health and Amy have been incredibly professional withe.

They were useless. They said they would call after urine testing results and they did not. This happened twice and after I called and left 3 messages both times. I would not recommend this place for any kind of help.|Dr. Evans was terrible today. He said I am too young for pain medication and that I should get a spinal fusion. Which I was told not to get because I am too young. Also I have no one to watch my son while I would be recovering from surgery but he ignored that. I am in a lot of pain from him poking and prodding my back today during the exam I certainly don't trust him for the injection he recommended. I told him I had already tried the injections and they don't work. He wanted me to do more X-rays and injections. What a waste of my time and now my back hurts more. He is a BAD LISTENER or just didn't understand I don't have any childcare to help me with these injection appointments or post op recovery. He didn't even ask me what happened to my back until right before he left. He seemed angry for me even asking for pain medication and just had an argumentative attitude with me from the moment I suggested it until the end of our appointment. I told him NSAIDS don't work he ignored me and called them into the pharmacy anyway. Don't waste your time with him.|I had my first visit today and I was pleasantly surprised of how great their sincere care was. After reading so many bad reviews on here, I honestly wasn't given much hope, but they are great! Deborah Johnson was amazing and treated me with great respect in understanding my pain. They are very strict in their pain management which they should be and have to be.  I don't know what future visits will be like but I do know they have my best interest at heart and if there happens to be any problems it will be because of my own failure in following what is required of me. Disregard all the bad reviews you read, these are great doctors and I highly recommend them!

My second visit was great as well! Amy Patel was so pleasant and caring in all my concerns. When I look back at bad reviews, I realize it's a patient problem, not a doctor problem... I'll leave it at that and not say more.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for true sincere help  with pain and problems.|I used to see Dr Evans and now see Dr Gregory...Dr Gregory is the best doctor I have ever had.  He listens to all my concerns and actually remembers what he says from one appointment to the next.  He is very professional and also compassionate. I give him 5 stars and highly recommend!|I agree with the reviews posted before me.  I had been to Southeast previously when Dr. Peacock was there and he was wonderful, but would not suggest anyone go there now.  I had gotten all of my records per their request and had them review them before my appointment, to ensure that they would take my case (which they said they would).  The only thing they did was talk down to me about what type of medicine I was on and that they didn't agree with it.  I am not a Doctor, so obviously those choices were not mine to make.  I am a professional, so I expect to be treated like such from ""professionals"".  I had all of my x-rays done previously twice, but they wanted me to pay for those again before doing ANYTHING at all.  I was completely embarrassed when I left and would never go back.  The girls at the front and the medical assistants in the back were very nice, but Amy and the Dr. were a nightmare.|Hey this is a wonderful place to go for help. Dr.Peacock is very good , I've been going for 6 months now and he is starting to get my pain under control. Like with anything it takes time. And from the front to the back of the staff you ladies do your job well. Thank you for your kindness you show my as well as my daughter and grandbaby Pineapples. Big shout out to Kim front desk. Rachael and Michelle Nurses in back always so kind to me. Keep up the good work!!!|I have been a patient here for a few years. I saw Dr. Peacock, when he left I saw Dr. Evans, Amy, Deborah, and now I see Dr. Gingerich. They all are professional, caring people. I highly recommend them. The ladies at the front desk at the hickory location are super sweet and efficient.
I have recieved injections at another practice, the injection site was not prepped properly and became infected. I have NEVER had any issues with the injections recieved from Southeast. A great healthcare team for chronic pain.|As a former nurse, I have always had high expectations of quality in care of myself and family. With that said,I'm surprised at some of the comments listed. Dr Evan's is VERY personable, VERY Respectful, LISTENS to ALL my concerns, changes etc regarding my back pain and care. Yes at one as with ALL places you go to these days there are 2 billing areas. One for the dr and one for the clinic as it's part of a chain of offices just like other places. This is normal.Since I have been there they have worked hard on the kinks in the system to try to make things easier on their clients. Insurance changes all the time folks. It's not easy to keep up with.and when you see hundreds or thousands of clients at different facilities....give them a medal for keeping up. As to injections....Dr Evan's is the best. Yes when I wait till it's more inflamed to get one due to my personal finances (not dr scheduling)...the more inflamed the more discomfort you can have for these moments it takes to receive a shot. But the staff is with  you in such a caring and respectful manner all the way. Sometimes I see Amy, (PA) and she does a good job. I think when people are sick or in pain and seeing a specialist most just prefer a dr title. Any time I've ever needed to ask Dr Evan's a question, Amy is sure to make sure He gets to answer it or that I get scheduled to see him on the next visit. I also love that there isn't a long wait time to be seen. They run a nice schedule and it's extremely rare that you have to wait long to be seen. The law and insurance has made some really strict rules regarding prescription pain meds and that has to get passed down to facilities having to keep tight records and rules. Each year you have to sign a new contract. And you have to go through the yearly and occasional random drug screens because of the rules that govern prescribing narcotics. They do a great job here on that too. And yall if you have a problem in following the rules ..don't complain about the facility...they are doing their legal duty. Complain to the thousands of drug users and dealers who caused the insurance companies and law to enforce such measures to make it difficult on those who need it most. That's the frustration facilities go through daily that we don't see. And I think SE Pain Care does a superb job of explaining this and following rules isn't a hard thing to do if you truly need your meds.  K. I'll get off my soap box LOL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRACTICE and Dr Evans!!

As a primary care physician I recognize Dr. Manvar's knowledge and expertise and appreciate the pain relief I got from his treatments of my significant back pain.  I recommend Dr. Manvar highly.  He uses healthy and effective modalities for pain relief rather than prescribing potentially habit forming pain pills. If you're suffering from chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes he's your man!|Dr Manvar and staff have been extremely professional from the staff as you enter their office, including the nursing staff and every person I have contact with.
Dr Manvar has been very caring and helpful with my issues.  I highly recommend Dr Manvar for your medical issues!|Dr. Manvar and the staff at Integrative Pain & Spine Institute were all very kind and helpful. I greatly appreciate the way Dr. Manvar spoke to me -- he is authentic, a great listener and was able to ease my ""new doctor anxiety"". He also said something that most doctors fail to understand: ""Only you know how it feels to have your body."" THANK YOU!|I was looking forward to this disappointment, hoping that I would get some relief and assistance with some chronic pain issues. I was referred here by the doctor standing in for my PCP and I have been disappointed in how they handle new patients.

The automated system called me several times sent me multiple text messages about the appointment, but I never actually received the email that I was told I was gonna receive with the new patient paperwork. I figured that was an oversight so I just decided to show up for the appointment prepared with my insurance information, photo ID and ready to fill out paperwork if necessary on site.

At arrival, I was informed that that there would be a $60 co-pay this was never discussed at any point in time during the numerous outreaches by the office to confirm my appointment.  Being someone that has dual health insurance, the co-pay is not something that is even supposed to be required at time of service because billing must be done to both insurances before you can determine if anything is owed. I am saying this as a Medical healthcare insurance specialist. I've been doing this professionally for over 10 years.

After explaining the process to the woman in the front office, she asked someone else who also said the co-pay was due, then also went to someone else in the back, and the person in the back did not even come to the front to speak to me they condescendingly said well this is not a Primary Care office therefore billing is done differently. Having worked for a primary care specialist and surgery centers I do know that this is incorrect. I do know that if you have a state based insurance like Medicaid and nothing is supposed to be paid until both insurances are paid. I did bring that up and I was informed that the reason why they collect co-pays from the primary insurance is Medicaid has not been paying their secondary claims.

I informed them that Medicaid gives a whole year for you to submit your claims and then if they are denying claims, you do then have a whole year to find out why the claims were denied and get them to re-Submitted. I also explained that normally if Medicaid is not paying it's because there is some documentation missing or some coding has gone wrong that the billing department has not done their research.

I'm just really frustrated with this as a new patient and has someone that is seeking medical guidance for ongoing chronic issue to show up to an appointment when I could've been working today just to find out that there was funds due that should not have been due to someone else, not knowing how to properly do their job.

Also, for those that no insurance taking the co-pay and then billing Medicaid if you do not refund the co-pay back to those patients once Medicaid pays, you are committing fraud.

This has been a horrible experience and I really hope they do better|Dr. Manvar and his team are fantastic. I have been under his care for over a year because of pain stemming from back surgery 15 years ago. They have maintained a high level of service, communication,  and professionalism. They fought with my insurance company through three appeals to get approval for a spinal cord stimulator. I had the trial a few weeks ago and it was very effective in reducing my low back pain. I would recommend Integrative Pain and Spine to anyone suffering with chronic pain.|Dr. Manvar is great. He listens to you and makes suggestions. I've had the implant and it's the best thing I've had done.
I suggest him to everyone!|This is what you call family. Been seeing Dr. Manvaar for over a year and he is amazing. Staff is amazing always courteous and office is always clean.

I have been going here for several years and I've only had one issue and that was because I took a gummy that I thought was permitted and it tested positive.  I have never had a bad urine before or since. I don't understand.
I was out of state with my fiance, who was in a terrible car accident and unfortunately I forgot my phone at home. I checked it as soon as I got home and called them the next day. I was told then that I was dismissed and they wouldn't allow me to talk to Ashley, to tell her what happened. I still have not been able to talk to Ashley to explain, so I'm stuck with no pain Dr and they won't even refer me to another pain clinic. I was up to 6 Perc 10s a day and when they dismissed me, they even called my drug store and canceled the prescription that I was gonna fill that day. So, I don't even have enough medication to get me through, till I find another Dr.  If anybody has any ideas on a pain Dr that won't screw over their patients, please let me know.|I have been seeing Dr. Ashley for about 2 months. She is very caring and has always listened the what I had to say. I had been to about 4 pain clinic's and was not able to get the help I needed. I don't understand why some people on here post that everyone in the office is rude. I have not had any problems whatsoever with anyone. They do have their rule, and if you follow them everything seems great. With all the rules that the US Government has on any doctor that writes pain medication for someone, I can understand why the rules are there. They don't want to loose their job, not to mention their license.|DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE , I was discharged because I could not get to office within a time limit they set for a random urine test , I begged them to allow me to come in later that same day but the nurse was  VERY RUDE and told me if I wasn't there in time I would be discharged , at this time I had been a patient there for 5 years and had NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH MY MONTHLY URINE TESTING.... And this has followed me for years , makes me look like a drug seeker AND THAT I AM NOT , I HAVE LEGITIMATE PAIN !!!!!!!|As a new patient, I would have never expected, the rudeness, nastiest, and unprofessionalism of the staff/receptionist ,they care nothing about the patients or their needs, all of them need to be retrained or fired! There is no scale to rate them only zeros apply.In turn this hurts the business..My doctor was exceptional,however the receptionist/staff determines if you're ever  get an appointment to even see them!! They are so rude ,nasty and so unprofessional!!|Dr. Brockman is an excellent doctor. I would highly recommend him. Since he sold his business to Carolina Comprehensive Pain Management it has been nothing but a nightmare. My 76 year old mother had to sit in the waiting room up to 5 hrs. She now has to see the doctor every month instead of every 3 months (not a big deal). The front desk staff is rude. They performed $1,400 worth of unnecessary tests that her insurance ultimately denied. They advised that if she didn't do the tests than she wasn't going to get her medicine. Also, advised that she is leaving for NJ for the holidays on Dec 16th and they still made her appointment on the 16th advising that we need to change our flight arrangements. Are you kidding me? No matter how much we love Dr. Brockman, we have to change doctors. What a shame that such a profitable, pleasant business has turned to this.|I agree with another commenter.  I have been seeing Dr Brockman for years and while there are times his bedside manner left more to be desired, he was always advocating for my care. He never once made me feel that I was crazy or a drug seeker. He always affirmed my pain, listened to my experiences,  and allowed me ro be an active participant in my care.  The nurses were always the sweetest too. However,
since he sold his business to Carolina Comprehensive Pain Management it has been nothing but a nightmare. The whole front office staff was replaced and I believe they must ride in on broomsticks as they are incredinly rude and condescending. I have been an established patient there for years but treat me like I know nothing (especially since I am younger). The paperwork is a nightmare. You are forced tp wait much longer to be seen (& heaven forbid you need to pee before the nurse calls). You are forced to come every month instead of every three months which costs significantly more time and money. It is sad and incredibly frustrating as a long-term patient.|In defence of Dr. Steven Brockman I would like to give my honest review from over 2 years of being under his care/ watchful eye of the government.. If you can follow all of the rules that our caring government has forced upon the pain management doctors of our day, then you will not have any complaints about Dr. Brockman or his service. Recently due to a change in his business there are a lot more patients at the Shelby Clinic. With the patient flow increase this has lead to several complaints that I have found online. Most are from clients that have had to wait too long in the waiting room. My advice to anyone that feels like there may have been a mistake, or that they have been lost in the shuffle is to walk up to the receptionist and speak up for yourself instead of sitting there getting upset.|Dr. Brockman is strict. But as you follow the rules you'll have no trouble. I've been going to him since 2002! And I think he's the most professional doctor around!

For all my hassles with workers comp claim, she was the only care provider to give satisfactory Time & Effort for my well being above all. Thank you doctor!|I can't express the relief it has been to have found Dr. Pasi and her colleagues. For over a year, I've been trying to get quality neurology care, and in just a few weeks, Dr. Pasi has helped reduce my pain, pinpoint multiple abnormalities, and improve my quality of life. I would recommend anyone in need of pain management or neurologic evaluation to this team! Thank you for helping me to spend fewer days in pain, without additional prescription drugs.|Stay far away. I went here for my back pain and the doctor disregarded my past procedures done, glossing them over as unimportant or irrelevant. She then proceeded to do the most bizarre physical evaluation I've ever had, including repeatedly pulling on my legs even though I said that hurt my lower back and stabbing the bottom of my foot with a blunt spike. The doctor also said she doesn't want to look at the MRI because her ""computer doesn't do that"" when it works perfectly fine for my home computer with no setup required. At checkout they asked at least 10x when I want my next appointment when I kept saying I'm unsure what I want done and wish to think it over. They called to ask me what pharmacy I want to use even though I had written it down 3x, I had a bad vibe about them so I told them I don't want any prescriptions from them, and the receptionist says ""you don't want it???"" (Tramadol prescription) like I was wasting her time at a garage sale. Now we're receiving bills  for procedures/tests that were either never done or never requested because there was no reason to do so. The doctor also put in a request to my insurance to do a procedure when I had told her I want to wait and consider my options. This place is just an operation to gain money not to treat patients.|My experience at APC has been very positive.  After more than 2 years of suffering from a painful hip and pains shooting down both legs my primary care physician referred me to Dr. Pasi at Advanced Pain Consultants. MRI and X-ray confirmed a bulging disc and advanced arthritis in my lumbar vertebrae. Dr. Pasi treated me with an eipdural shot of steroids and shots in the facet joints of the lumbar vertebrae. I had nearly instantaneous relief of the pain that has persisted for nearly 5 months and has allowed me to resume my normal activities.|I will never have another major surgery without their help. My first back surgery took me through a year of hellish pain. I never knew that a pain specialist could help with my recovery. When I needed another back surgery, I swore to never go through that kind of pain again and found Dr. Pasi. I came home from the hospital with a 9 out of ten pain level for the first two days (it was a weekend) knowing I had an appointment on Monday. After receiving the low dose proper pain medicine, my pain level went down to a 2 only four days after a more involved back surgery. I didn't want to suffer for another year. I am frequently monitored to make sure that I am taking the correct dosage and not abusing the medication which is how it should be. The people who abuse prescription medication makes it difficult for those of us who truly need the medicine for a period of time to get through a surgery. My surgeon said that the DEA only approves five days of narcotics post back surgery. I only am able to take a certain few medications due to intolerance or ineffective problems. That's why I asked my surgeon prior to seeing Advance Pain Specialist if this is what I need to have a positive experience with minimal pain after major back surgery. It has been the best decision to aid in my recovery. I don't have an addictive personality and assume Advance Pain Specialist can spot someone with one quickly. I absolutely recommend any person who knows they will have a painful recovery to contact them and make the best decision of their lives. Dr. Pasi is a sweet, calm and caring person who can help with either short term pain or long term pain management. Call her...you owe yourself that.|I was referred to Dr Pasi by my GP 2 yrs ago for severe back pain that was progressively getting worse and going into my hip and down my leg. Dr Pasi began with injections, then nerve block with very little relief. She started giving me medications for relief and referred me for PT. After PT did not help she progressed to stronger pain meds, constantly monitoring my dosage and effects.  When stronger opioid meds did not help and my pain was getting worse Dr. Pasi suggested I consider having a neuro stimulator implanted.  She referred me to a surgeon that would install the stimulator. The surgeon said surgery was not recommended due to the condition of my back and he also recommended I try the stimulator. The stimulator was put in a little over a month ago and although I still have some pain, I can now have some periods of no pain. I can finally enjoy having a life again. My thanks to Dr Pasi for being so knowledgeable and caring over the past two years.|I have been seeing Dr. Sonia Pasi for the past three years. I had tremendous pain in my neck and whenever I turned my head you could hear the bones cracking. The MRI said advanced arthritis. I was also a former Navy carrier pilot. I was 76 and an avid golfer. Through an Internet search I found Advanced Pain Consultants. Dr. Pasi evaluated me and and based on her recommendation, over the course of eight months had two rounds of Faucet shots and radio ablation. I was pretty much pain free after the first round of shots. After three years, I have full rotation of my neck and no pain.

Scroll forward three years and because of golf and old age I have had major lower back pain. Again Arthritis. Dr. Pasi gave me bilateral shots in my lower back and within a week, I am pain free.

I highly recommend Dr. Pasi and Advanced Pain Consultants. I call her my ""Miracle"" Doctor.

John|I been a patient of Dr. Sonia Pasi almost 2 yrs. I highly recommend Dr. Pasi. When I first went to Dr. Pasi I was in a great deal of pain, I feel a lot better than when I first went.

Dr. Naveria is highly skilled and very professional and respectful of his patients. ( i always say if i had patience i would be a Dr.) But No thank you. Lol  the Nurses are also Great and caring i've had many laughs with them and that's what makes for a happy enviorment. Dr. Naveria is Great but FOLLOW the rules of your signed contract because that is a serious violation on the patients part, if that's the case you just might have to start taking motrin. Thank you Dr. For treating me and to Nurse Corey, Jennifer and others thank you for what you do, you all are important to your profession. You truely are the 1st line of treatment and i again say Thank You.  I would'nt go anywhere else even if the Treatment was free. Thank you Kathy at the front desk, your an essential worker as well. You know the patients as soon as we walk through the front door. Your professionalism is also top notch.

So far I have noticed about an 85% reduction of pain in my lower back.  Judging from the pain relief I've received, I would recommend to anyone to try this procedure.  I know there are no guarantees, but it has worked for me and I have been in chronic back pain for many years.|Spine & Pain Associates has been a life-changing experience for my mother. I cannot speak highly enough about all the staff and their outstanding work. From the first appointment, the experience here was vastly different from her previous pain clinic. Rebecca NP took the time to listen and put together the whole story of my mother's pain. She treated her as more than just a patient and proposed a detailed treatment plan that she has made appropriate changes to based on my mother's feedback. Dr. Dhaliwal has been one of the best physicians she has ever had the pleasure to experience. He is not one of those physicians who try to leave as quickly as possible. He does an excellent job explaining every procedure to my mother and answering all questions thoroughly. He truly wants her to be involved in her treatment.

This review pertains only to this nurse.

This nurse has poor interpersonal skills and turns dialogue with the patient, that should be therapeutic, into an adversarial confrontational,  and disrespectful interaction, creating a toxic encounter for the patient. She said multiple times, in response to questions  about alternative treatments, that they wasted her time and declined to answer them. These comments echo other negative comments about her on the web. I am disappointed that this conduct still needs to be addressed and that I had to be subjected to the same sort of objectionable behavior that others have reported.|My wife and I moved up to Hendersonville, from Florida to be closer to our daughter. I was in Pain Management for 7 plus years in Florida, without incident. I went to Pardee Pain management once we moved up and initially saw Dr. Lewis. Very straight forward, but no issues. For the subsequent visits it was the ARPN Megan Scarborough. Please if you see her, leave. Her approach to patients is aggressive and uncaring. (See other patient reviews with similar complaints.) I had shoulder surgery end of January 2024, on my last visit with Pardee, Megan accused me of getting additional pain meds from my surgeon in March. I explained my last refill from my surgeon was mid-February (which she was aware of from my February visit). She told me she was looking at the additional refills. I stated let's call the surgeon and she said no, she would call the pharmacy. She returned about 15 minutes later and stated that I was correct, no refills in March as she had falsely accused me of. How do you falsely accuse someone of something like that, especially in Pain Management. What was she looking at? Isn't this an ethical violation. I have since terminated my contract with Pardee and now have to start all over again. I will be reaching out to the NC Medical review board to file a complaint.|Most doctors will go over what they will be doing, might tell you ""this will hurt"", tell you how long it will last, etc. So the patient will understand what Is going to happen.   Dr. Mansfield greeted me, then didn't say a word until the procedure was over.  I was very clearly writhing in pain at several points in the procedure.  He didn't say a word, or show any concern whatsoever.  He asked if I had any questions when we were done.  I did, but he didn't answer any of them, letting the nurse answer them.  He should pick a specialty where he can deal with cadavers only.  He shows no empathy or concern for his patients.  I have NEVER had such a poor excuse for a caregiver.|I'm am really torn with this place right now!!! I read the reviews on Mychak and it was right. I understand they have to be tough and hard because of the pill epidemic. I was mad because they called me a month out talking about we need your records from Florida and when I showed up a month later there were no records from my pain center in Florida. Y'all all need to understand in the reviews is this is a business model. They will run that insurance any which way they can and still not help you! Idk I guess I'm so immune to working with bad drs it's seemed no different to me! At least Dr. Mychak was cute!!!! He looks like Donald Trump Jr.... But a cuter version. At least if I didn't get the help I needed that day I got a piece of eye candy!!! Lol I see Megan next so we shall see what she is about and I'll update!!! Even if she has an attitude maybe she will be cute too!!!! Lol|My husband will never go there again period !!!!!!!! I was sitting in there with him and the nurse was rude and Dr. Mycheck was very rude!!!!! There is no need for him to say what he did. """" Is anyone holding a gun to your head to go to the pharmacy to go get pain medication that your heart surgeon prescribed you """". A little update on my husband. He had a triple bypass surgery last month so of course he is going to be subscribed pain medication. He had his ribs cracked opened!!!! Well  needless to say he will not be back and guess what we reported him. Should have reported the nurse also treating my husband like he was dumb!!!!|Floors were nasty with what looks like blood splatter on the floor, spills, and dust stuck to the floor in those places. The dr was rushed, didn't look at my ct, made a plan for injections, but never told me where they were injecting, what they were injecting or how many. I tried to ask questions, but dr Mansfield was walking out or the room, leaving,  as he answered them short and curt. It's like he came in, said yep, n left. I was left with so many questions. He said he was only addressing the pain that the referral was for n didn't want to look at my other problems.  We made an appt for injections. Then 6 days before procedure, staff called and said they had to cancel bc they forgot to call in lovenox  bridge and I would had to have stopped blood thinner 5 days before procedure. But this was 6 days before. She just kept repeating it. I don't understand. The star was super nice and helpful, but the dr scared me and my husband and I cancelled second appointment. What a relief while still being in pain.|I find the staff very polite and easy to engage.  I was not as pleased with my doctor.  She spent all of about 5 minutes with me each visit only to send me to another specialist.  After 5+ appointments there, I finally got a chance to work with the PA who was WONDERFUL!! She listened, answered all my questions and finally started me on a pain management course of medication - explaining it would take time to get the medication dose correct.|I want to thank all of the staff that I encountered on my first appointment today.
I was treated with dignity and respect. Most importantly competent care with compassion to help me through the process of achieving pain relief .

He received the most unempathetic care I have witnessed by a nurse practitioner today. Her name is Joshi Susmitha. She does not belong in the care of patients seeking care for this speciality because she lacks the understanding and compassion to do her job professionally. I question her choice of practice along with questioning her ethics to hold a license.  I will be submitting a complaint to Duke Hospital system and the North Carolina Board of Nursing|I should've read reviews before going to this clinic. Dr Peter Yi did not address my pain needs at my visit and won't take the time to respond to my messages- he instead responded to my wound care Dr who informed me Dr Yi wanted me to make an appointment!! His nursing staff is rude, is bothered when you call. There are so many other pain clinics/Drs nearby. I am switching and if you want to be treated by a Dr and staff that actually cares about you and your needs, I recommend you go elsewhere as well.|Had a steroid injection on 10 February Been an excruciating pain since and they won't see me same day and they don't really give a damn they keep sending me to my primary care or the emergency room. This place sucks and so does the staff hate to even go back in March Duke emergency room is not any better.|Specifically for the Biofeedback Clinic. I like the provider and the experience during our appointments. I am almost never able to get in touch with/have my calls returned by the front desk, however. Coupled with how busy they are, and that the appointments often cannot be made or rescheduled on MyChart, I have lost steam in wanting to make or attend appointments because I have essentially no assistance from the staff.|Actually they deserve a negative 5 star rating!
I have been referred multiple times and was even given an appt with only less than 2 hours notice which was impossible to make.
Now they will not make another appt for me, without giving me a reason.  They have told me to go to the Raleigh pain clinic. I have gone to the patient advocates requesting a review and still I am being denied access for no legitimate reason.
Dr's Diamond, Vorenkamp, and Anwar deserve to have a complaint filed against them for
Irresponsibility, and slander to start with. The clinic doesn't responsibly act on referrals!
Very poor judgment on their part.  They don't care about anything but themselves!|Front desk staff is amazing! The psychology/biofeedback side of the clinic has staff that are above and beyond. But, the other side of the clinic that handles nerve and tissue pain has doctor's supporting staff that needs bedside training or pursue a career that doesn't require care and patience. Some of them seem like they hate their job and respond rudely. I won't call them out but the atmosphere is extremely different on one side of the clinic versus the other.|I am in disbelief at the moment. I can't fathom how such a respected institution can treat patients in such careless and dispensable manner. My physician referred me to this clinic for a second opinion and I was told that it would be 10 weeks before I would know if I was ""approved"" as a patient. So, I waited and waited and then decided to call an follow up. Apparently I was denied and no explanation was given. Not only that, but I was never notified that my referral was denied. So, basically Duke expects you to continually call in to see if your referral will be accepted since they won't be taking the time to notify the patient that they will need to find another option. More over, they apparently don't think it is worth their time to explain why they aren't accepting another physician's referral. Clearly, Duke knows that patients are referred to them because their current physician feel their patient needs the next level of expertise. But, Duke doesn't have the respect to communicate or consider the amount of time a patient is kept waiting. What an outright disregard to patient care and respect.|My doctor referred me to Duke Pain Medicine Clinic. Within a couple days I received a  call from them. They acknowledged the referral but said they have no appointments available. I asked when they thought something would become available and she said she didn't know. I asked for a guesstimate and she said she couldn't give me one. Never experienced anything like this; however, after reading reviews of other people's experience I understand where they are coming from. I think I will find other options.",2024-12-09|2024-10-10|2025-02-25|2024-08-29|2024-04-22|2023-11-08|2022-05-02|2023-02-19,1|1|1|3|1|3|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",84.2|79.8|78.8,"Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJeVrAo7LjrIkR0afT7HfqJLE,76

Moreover, Dr. V  suggested that Duke Medical consider ordering an MRA and this was also found to be justifiable and has been ordered for my my brain and neck. Of course V Pain Clinic will get a 5 star rating from me. Just wanted to say thank you for caring about your patients. It's very much appreciated. And for those who are nervous about getting on the steroid injection wheel...Dr. V did not suggest that form of treatment for my spine as it would not have proven  beneficial.

My last appt with Dr Viji Shankar was 12-23. I went for chronic back pain and treatment fibromyalgia. My first visit, the Dr spoke very fast and quickly dismissed what I told her. I told her that I had steroids psychosis prior and I didn't want steroid injections. She told me that was rare and scheduled me for a diagnostic test with steroids. The test was uneventful on my part. The alternate side was done a few weeks later on Dec of 23. As she numbed the area, I felt each shot. Horrible pain. I told her I felt that and it was painful, she told me to relax. As she proceeded with the injections, I told her I wasn't numb. She didn't stop. Just relax she told me. I cried out in pain and was sobbing. Her assistant apologized. I asked the assistant if the Dr could prescribe something for pain. She said she prescribed patches but I never got them. I had left 5 messages using the Patient Portal. I was told by their office that don't use the Patient Portal. Why would I go to ANYONE that I would pay to treat me like this.|Of I could leave 0 or negative stars I would have. I'm 65, in a wheelchair,  have lung cancer that I'm not going to have treatment for and have had heart bypass surgery. This woman wouldn't give me meds without knee shots I've already tried or burning my nerves off in my knees. She couldn't speak enough English so that I could understand her but my wife was able to make out most if it. I do not recommend this place for anything except making sure they get their money|Nice staff worker's but the doctor she speaks to fast and barley understand what she's saying and if you have a question good luck if you get to ask it because she doesn't give you a chance to ask her anything, I had went there to get injections three times and nothing worked so I was referred to a surgeon by them couldn't get ahold of them so I called back to the so I called this place back and asked to get referred to my suggested surgeon and it's been a month since I've asked them to do that and nothing , I've been trying to call them every day and ask why they haven't sent my paperwork to the  surgeon and yet they have answered the phone. I'm very very very very unhappy with them right I'm in so much pain and I just want some kind of relief so y'all do better!!|2022 was the worst summer of my life. I never knew that pain could be that bad. I had never heard of NSPC.  I just went to the same office where my mother had her pain issues treated years prior. Her doctor wasn't there anymore, but Dr Shankar and Noli were. I was in too much pain to be picky. They did right by me|I have to admit that I prejudged this office based on an experience from a few years ago and I have to apologize in the biggest way possible. The entire staff has been nothing but nice and welcoming since the first time I went back. If they had told me to find another office because of the attitude I had, I wouldn't have blamed them. Again my sincere apologies to everyone.
I have to give the entire team here 5 stars because they greet me with nothing but respect and I am very grateful for the way they treat their patients.|Never answer the phones, front desk is cover they have a ring camera to see if somebody is there if you are lucky and they see you they open the window. The doctor I see speak fast I can understand her good go strait to medicines without putting a hand on my and explore more of my situation. I call last week to cancel my appointment because of my bad experience I leave a mesage, nobody contact me yet. Find another place , even talking in the waiting room with other patience have the same issues I have experience.|I don't understand how they can practice medicine, but their patients have to have a certain insurance for them to see you.

I was a new patient and was SHOCKED when  Dr. Brian Thwaites actually came into the room, sat down and talked to me about my pain and procedure. He was very informative and kind. The nurse was great, too. I have had injections at other clinics where I never ever laid eyes on the doctor because I was face down on the table when they walked in. My only complaint is that they need better signage outside. It was my first visit and I had no idea how to get into the right building. My ""not so patient"" husband was irritated that we had to walk around in the rain to find the correct entrance.|Dr Kenneth Fulp is amazing. He takes his time with you if you need it. Answers your questions and is direct with it. Best pain management doctor in town in my option. Thank doc for everything you do.|What a disaster this place is. The doctor was ok the rest of the staff are arrogant, rude, incompetant and clearly no nothing about customer service.
In addition, like everyone else that is required before you get service, I paid my copay of $30. Apparently, the office did not forward proof to billing and billing has been harrassing me for payment. I asked billing to request a copy of the receipt from the front desk. They refuesed and said it required me to walk into the clinic, get a copy and hand carry it to them.
I told them i would not do that and they could just request it intraoffice. Instead they turned it over to a debt collector.
Its either incompetence or its First Health's way of double billing to increase revenue. There is no support or help they provide to assist those who have been impacted by their mistakes/incompetence.|This used to be a great place, but ever since Dr. Lauren Williams took over Dr Steve Collins' practice it's been going downhill.
I was recently out of the Country and ran out of my meds. When I came home, I advised the ofc that I was out of my meds and requested a refill which was denied.  Long story short, Dr Williams and her staff were negligent and unprofessional having a chronic pain patient be without any medication for days and going through withdrawal symptoms as a result. The office staff lied about her being out of town and having a prescription sent to the pharmacy on my behalf.
Despicable behavior for a medical doctor, especially a chronic pain specialist.  I have since transferred back to Dr. Collins where my health and well being are paramount.|I had been seen at FHBN Clinic since 2018 for my Back and Neck Pain issues. I love the care I received from both Dr Winkly and Dr Mokris - both very caring and concerned. After years of seeing PA Steve Collins since 2018, on one visit in March of 2022  I calmly questioned him that his charting  was confusing and did not reflect my pain diagnosis (it looked like he was cutting and pasting )   and that he failed to  order a very needed MRI of my neck. PA Collins became very angry, yelled at me  gaslit me that  that I was verbally attacking him and then cancelled all of my appointments with the clinic - in the middle of a major issue with my neck pain. I question why a Physician's assistant should have  so much control over whom Dr's see and that I was never even further evaluated by the Dr's  Mokris for really poor care and a lack of trust in these Medical Providers. First Health should know about this  really loose canon of a provider|I have been going here for 2 years now and the staff is horrible with customer service. They tell you there are going to call you back with updates on medication or appointments and you don't hear anything from them the whole day. Communication is key especially with chronic pain patients who rely on pain meds and chronic pain management. Then when you call them multiple times you may be seen as aggressive or drug seeking especially if you are on pain meds. I think this may be last go round with this clinic.|NO stars if possible! Dr Thomas has been excellent but his STAFF, rude and no empathy. Was late due to traffic, in pain, plus driving in from our of town. Tried to give me an appt TWO months out when foot specialist said I need to see my back and pain doctor. Then they said the clinical manager or nurse would call me. Called finally claiming I was a no show that day and two other times! No longer a patient but that lady wasn't nice that morning I arrived 15 minutes late. Dr Thomas was awesome, on to another specialist hopefully with professional staff and I'm not achild! Don't talk to me any kind of way bevayse I look young but have grown children. I will never refer nobody else due to STAFF|I've been a patient of Dr Thomas for over a year. I used to like him very much. However his staff is HORRENDOUS & EXTREMELY RUDE not only that they DON'T HONOR THE FIRST HEALTH LATE POLICY NOR does Dr Thomas, I couldn't be MORE disappointed in this so-called business. I was late about 2-3 different times. I was shy of being 10 minutes late one time, and twelve minutes late another time. The policy is that you have to be there within 15 minutes of the appt time. Life happens and especially unpredictable traffic in this town. But they don't care, they overbook ALL THE TIME so the policy CAN'T be honored. It makes NO SENSE. I always wait 15 minutes or more when I do arrive on time.

I've also requested NUMEROUS times to not be called before 9:30am. I've suffered from horrible insomnia ever since I was small. I have the worst time getting to sleep and staying asleep. I was forced to block their number as I had to function on very little sleep that day since they felt the need to call me 3 times about 1 appt. They failed to send over all of my prescriptions to my pharmacy(& blamed it on the pharmacy)which resulted in me randomly seeing spots for over a week. I wish the staff matched the care I receive from Dr Rob. After my next appointment I'll be transferring my care to another pain clinic. Dr Thomas' nurse laughed at me and sternly said that ""they're not changing the policy JUST for me"". She's clearly in the wrong field.  She doesn't care about the patients, just what's most convenient for herself and the staff. Oh and the fact that they DOUBLE CHARGE YOU isn't great either.

Today was the final straw, I'll be seeking another provider, which really is a shame. PA Thomas and Dr Mocris are great.

Dr. Swiber is a gem, and I'm so grateful to have such an amazingly talented, empathetic, exceptional physician so close to home. They truly welcome me and make me feel at home. I always look forward to my never blocks as they best help me manage my pain, but I also look forward to seeing everyone and hearing how they're doing! Pain clinics are run differently than most, so just understand that the intake process takes time, you'll have regular office visits and med checks and that's completely normal and to be expected, as every other pain clinic I've been to does the same! HIGHLY recommend!!|The behaviour of the staff, with the exception of Megan, is absolutely reprehensible! I can't even fathom how they could be so completely incompetent without trying. Months of confusion, un-professionalism and attitude and no closer to seeing a doctor.|Dr. Swiber is a true blessing! He is extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of pain management, and is always willing to listen and try different things to help manage your pain. It can be so hard for patients with chronic, life altering pain to find a caregiver who actually cares about their patients, but that's exactly how Dr. Swiber makes you feel.
When my pain management doctor in Wilmington moved away, I was so scared that I would never find a doctor to help me like he did. Before he left he made sure that I was set up with Dr. Swiber, and I'm so thankful that he did! I'm coming up on two years being in the Cedar Point office and hopefully will never have to go anywhere else.|I moved here last July and was a regular at my previous pain clinic, so I was very worried about finding someone who not only I trusted, but also understood my situation and my unique needs. I have been a patient with Dr. Swiber and Jason for about a year now and I must say, I didn't anticipate finding an anesthesiologist not only so close to home, but also with an incredible team who makes me feel like I'm their one and only patient!

The quality of care is the best of the best, (and I've been to a ton of specialists), and we have a plan and routine that works well! I'm so grateful for their wonderful care, and would recommend them to everyone who is seeking help. Please understand that pain clinics have different protocols than other types of physicians and so the complaints I see in other reviews are pretty common with most any pain clinic, because I think people don't understand how things are done differently and why they must be. None of this is out of the ordinary and is what all pain centers do. So please know that Dr. Swiber and Jason and the entire team have your best interests in mind and will do their absolute best to take good care of you! That's been my experience anyway, so I'm taking the time to share my thoughts as I'm so grateful for them! Thank you, and I'll see you again soon. :)|Big thank you to this group of professional people MD Mr.Swiber amazing and MD Ms.Megan Frank amazing and to all the staff of carolina pain management for always taking care of my Mom. God bless you all.|My migraine doctor at a different clinic ended up out unexpectedly and was no longer able to do the occipital and trigeminal nerve blocks I had been receiving every 6 weeks for years. I spent a few months getting referrals to other neurologist but their appointments were past the date of my next appointment with my old doctor so I decided I had to just wait until Jun for the appointment which was 6 months from the time of my last nerve blocks. My doctor ended up canceling the appointment in Jun because he was still not expected back in the office so I scrambled calling around to see where I could go. Carolina pain center got my referral bit could only do 1 of the 2 nerve blocks. I took the appointment because anything was better than nothing at that point. I get to my first appointment and they recommend a cervical MRI to rule out a cause of te migraines from my neck. I agreed because it has never been do e before. I get scheduled for the MRI and they schedule me for the nerve block a month later. A family member who also deals with migraines sent me the information. For a nearby migraine clinic and I called. They said they could do both nerve blocks and get me I. Sooner for them. I took the appointment and let carolina pain center know when they called me about my mri results. They let me know I had 2 disc in my neck with issues and recommended cervical epidural.  I declined initially because I wasn't sure about it. They understood and stated if I decided to do it to give them a call and they would be happy to do that. I get in with my migraine specialist and after talking to her she recommended I get it done. They don't do them so I called carolina pain center to get scheduled for the cervical al epidural. That same day I received a letter in the mail informing me I was not able to have them as part of my Healthcare team anymore. Surely this was a mistake. The receptionist was polite and said she'd talk to the doctor. I received a call back this morning informing that they were unable to do the epidural. The doctor refused to works with another doctor because I decided to go someplace that could administer both the nerve blocks.

The migraine specialist does not do cervical epidurals so I have to find a different doctor to provide treatment for an issue identified by the carolina pain center.

The doctor's at the carolina pain center are the kind of doctors that make other doctors look bad.

Punishing a patient because they found a different doctor to provide thr treatment they needed is absurd.|Always received fantastic care.  Would highly recommend.|UPDATE: Unfortunately, Jason has left the practice. Now I'm left with another PA who said at the appointment that she would call in another med for migraines then she didn't call anything in. When I called her back, she told me to try supplements. I have liver disease, she didn't bother to check interactions. When I suggested that she change meds, she said that she would if I brought in my current meds so that she could make sure they were destroyed. Jason has never treated me like a kid in kindergarten. Apparently, Shanee thinks I'm a circus monkey who needs to be put in a cage and unable to function as the responsible adult that I am. Frustrated and disheartened.

I just received proof that this provider lied when I attempted to switch pain clinics. They told the pain clinic that they had discharged me. I asked how they just called in a higher dose of a med if they discharged me in May of 2023.

I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but that would constitute a deceptive, intentional interference in continuity of care. Ultimately forcing me to not be able to find another provider outside of them. They have now committed defamation of character.",2024-10-29|2024-12-20|2024-05-09|2023-09-10|2024-09-09|2023-06-08|2025-02-12|2019-09-26,5|1|5|5|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do you need a referral to be seen","Yes from your primary physician",emergency_appointments|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJP3NaWrf7qIkRSMsM-riGKkk,21

Dr Govil took the time to listen to my concerns, thoroughly evaluate my condition, and tailor a treatment plan that suited my specific needs. They were patient in answering all my questions and explaining the options available to me.

The treatment I received was highly effective, and I noticed a significant improvement in my pain levels within a few sessions. The clinic offers a comprehensive range of services, and I appreciated the holistic approach to managing pain, including both medical and non-medical therapies.

Moreover, the support staff, including the nurses and receptionists, were always professional and accommodating. Scheduling appointments was easy, and I never felt rushed during my visits.

In that time he provided me information concerning treatment of my autoimmune disorders that my specialists of   10 years had not suggested. He's extremely knowledgeable and obviously interested in medical sciences -- a forever learner. It doesn't take a special skill to notice that his face gives him away in his compassion for people; he cannot bear to see them suffer. He offered me a simple solution for my pain that other doctors had overlooked and it has changed my life completely. It helps not only my nerve pain but other issues within my neurological system that he obviously took note of during my intake as I wasn't even entirely aware of them myself. The rest of the staff are equally as impressive. They are kind and genuinely down-to-earth. Randall is my favorite! He ushers patients in and out overseeing that things are moving along. He chats with everyone and seems to get to know each patient. He's sweet, cheerful and interesting. He is personable and feels as if you've known him all your life; his overall demeanor is naturally attentive. It's an overall pleasant experience which is a relief and even a distraction from the constant mental torture that comes with chronic physical pain. My last couple of appointments have been extremely quick! If an appointment is longer it is only due to the fact that he happens to have a new patient and he invests extra time in that critical intake -- which I've gathered from experience he does with every single patient. If you're an established patient, have grace for others and hang tight. There is one doctor and too many people in this world suffering; a single person can only do so much. Last of all, it is refreshing to meet a doctor who is firm in his oath, conducting himself as a medical doctor and not a politician.|I don't understand the negative comments. I love the Dr here! I came in for my appointment with tears running down my face and he told me not to worry he will help figure it out. He's always kind but busy. There aren't a lot of pain clinics in my area so we drink 2 1/2 hours each way. Blessed to have found this place. Comments about him making sure to cover his butt needs to realize he could lose his license if he just hands out scripts.|This doctor's office is far better than what I have had for the past 15 years with the same PCP. Doctor doesn't dilly dally around with my health! He pins it down with the ""nail on the head!"" My last doctor was not reading my labs or MRI'S. This office knows their ""stuff"" and they are courteous, respectful, caring, polite and meticulous.  Here, I'm not waiting for 5-8 hours to be seen. Five minutes tops. I don't have to worry or wonder about my healthcare which was issues I had with my last doctor who never read my tests.  But God!!!|It hasn't been easy to deal with pain. I was ignorant to my problem. But thanks to Dr. Dakwa and staff my life whent from worst to better. I recommend The HEAG Pain Management for treatment. Thank you Dr. Dakwa and staff, for all your patience.
Sincerely,
R.L.|Personally, Doctor and Staff are Very pleasant and professional. It's very hard to receive treatment for pain that people cannot see.
I do not understand why there are reviews from 5 and 6 years ago. I have always been treated with kindness and professional care.|Terrible place. I was in horrible pain and yet made to wait just initially for an hour in their hard seats in the waiting area. After 45 mins i went to my car to grab Advil. While heading back in, I was approached by one of their long standing patients who literally BEGGED me to give them my pain medication! That I didn't have but NEVER would've given had I of had it! Already there was a bad taste in my mouth from that.
But then, while back in the FULL (to capacity) waiting area waiting even longer, one woman came in who was halfway in her seat/ halfway out, literally falling asleep in between her sentences. It was to the point that her own husband was embarrassed and BEGGING her to stop and sit up straight! When staff noticed, they asked her what was wrong with her and she replied, ""I'm just sooo tired."" They let her stay and be seen. And..she walked out (only a half hour later) with more prescriptions and seemed happy, even a little more awake. But here most of us were in visible pain, so uncomfortable that breathing was hard. ..and we were questioned relentlessly like addicts!

I went through about 11 tests of their choosing and spent 9 hours there! No exaggeration! All of this to be scolded for the medications that I have been on -for years -that work very well for me ..I just happened to of been displaced due my doctor of years getting very sick and out on medical leave. I had to find someone in a pinch. But they were so bad about sending my records to my referring doctor that his group grew seriously frustrated and decided to continue my care through another MD at their office. HEAG did NOT ever send the whole record, It came in pieces over weeks. And still. ..never all of the record. Even 2 years on!! Also, they weren't able to justify some of their tests they forced me to have either. Not To my medical group OR to my insurance. Some of those tests they TRIED to charge ME for - because insurance didn't cover the tests they CHOSE. They know which ones are covered. I never paid them. And I'll fight it forever.

The words of my referring group were, ""We are so sorry that you had to endure all of that! I don't even know how he's still able to work in the field. Obviously he cares little for his patients. Rest assured this will never happen to one of our patients again."" They even canceled other patients appts who had been referred to HEAG by my then doctors office. Luckily the doctors within the group where my doctor went on medical leave at kept great records so they could easily see the kind of patient I had been for 11 years. They treated me like a patient in pain. ..not someone who had to prove myself at every single turn. Not some addict that needed to prove I wasn't. This experience was absolutely traumatizing for me. I dont know how they're still there with the reviews I've read, those I've heard from patients and other doctors alike. I'm shocked. ..but at the same time, I'm not. Healthcare in the USA has seriously gone downhill ESPECIALLY where pain management is concerned. Sad state we're in here. Avoid this place though! There ARE better ones!|Disorganized, long wait times and they are way too over cautious. They are more interested in protecting their own arses than the care of a patient.  Basically, you are treated as a drug addict unless you can prove otherwise. The testing is extensive, some without merit, including a breathalyzer test. I've never been subject to this kind of testing and waste of time before. They test for kratom so if you're using it responsibly for pain management, (yes, it is still legal) you'll be scolded, talked down to, and asked to attend drug counseling. yikes.

If you read his bio it looks like he has his heart  in the right place but his life experiences have not caught up .This was an Incredibly disappointing experience. I was not seen through a lens of compassion or treated like a responsible individual. Dr. Wolf treated me like a child and I am old enough to be his mother. He pushed me to either drop my anxiety medication or forfeit pain medication. I use anxiety medication perhaps twice a month. I told him so and he simply refused to budge. I told him I've had other practitioners who knew my history and knew I would never combine those kinds of medications. He answered by saying,"" you can go back to them."" ( no ,I cannot, one is retired and the other was with a different insurance). With muscular skeletal pain through out my body, osteoarthritis and a labor intensive business as an alternative medical practitioner , I felt interrogated and unseen. At 55 with a spotless record and wide knowledge of medication and interaction ,Dr Wolf's protocols were held above common sense and kindness. It's all about law suits and malpractice. I have to start over with someone that can actually help me with my pain so I can recover. Dr. Wolf I am in a lot of pain. Daily. That is why I came. I have a long term plan to find my health again. I think you have missed the plot. I hope , really hope you find it. Take people on a case by case basis. Listen hard . I see true goodness in you. I believe you will learn that fine balance  in healthcare. I would recommend taking a medical communication course on how to speak to people that won't put them on defense . Blessings...|This facility and Doctor are very unprofessional and the front office as well as the manager.  I was seen there for a year but after I didn't agree with Dr. Wolf treatment he punished me by not filling my medication early as he did all year and then discharging me...knowing I am moving to Europe in weeks he left me with just enough refills to stop right before my move as if this is morally right to do to anyone. Punished me further by the discharge not just for him but their entire facility, all locations. Then and to this day are witholding me records so I can't get treatment anywhere else in the area. I've tried over 30 Doctors and noone will see me. I've emailed them begging for help, just ignored. No records, no medication and no Doctor. They just abandoned me. I even drove over an hour to be seen by the same place and a different Dr. They wouldn't let me see the Dr because this Dr, Wolf, made sure to discharge me from all locations just to be extra mean. Now with me leaving and no records, I can't get treated anywhere and all I needed was one more refill, which he refused today. As if he hasn't done enough harm, now just making sure I don't have relief from this debilitating disease right before my international move. He is pure evil and I wouldn't trust him with my worst enemy.

Understand, I am a single mom of 2 with a chronic pain disease through all limbs, incredibly painful. This Doctor put his ego above his oath and left me and my kids in harms way. If you go here beware, the minute you disagree or speak up about the many problems here, your out and they will make you pay even if it threatenes your life. They don't care. Save yourself the future pain and find another place to go.|In my time as a patient of those office I've seen several providers. For the most part they have all been excellent at listening to my description of complaints and working with me to design a treatment program specific to my needs. I am currently seeing Cathy and it's my pleasure to say that her skills and knowledge is exceptional. She takes the time to consider alternate therapies and then goes the extra mile to look into insurance coverage for potential procedures. I am completely comfortable with her as my provider. The fact that the support staff is fantastic is just icing on the cake. Thank you all for the amazing things that you've done for me.|I truly have NEVER seen anything as unprofessional as this place in my entire life.  I myself am a medical professional It was an awful experience that cost me a lot of wasted time.  They treated me as if I was some dope addict from the street.  The md filled a prescription with the pharmacy and refused to correct it I was given 2 appts where the doc was out ""sick"".  Then I was told by the receptionist not even a med tech that she was giving me permission to take meds.  Go somewhere else.  These people r the bottom of the barrel.  Find a professional and this practice is not it!!!  I gave the 1 star but it does not rate that|First off, all of the staff have all been super friendly and helpful each time I have come for a visit. Dr. Ju is also really nice, very knowledgeable, and takes pride in his work which I really appreciate. He very quickly pinpointed the source of my pain, and tested that his hypothesis was truly correct (it was). Now we are moving forward with longer term relief options, and I am excited about being mostly pain-free again with his help!|I'm amazed at some of te reviews here.
Some make me wonder if the reviewer is just angry about every place they go.

I've been treated here for 4-5 at least, through multiple doctors & multiple staff. The only bad experience I've had or seen is right after the place was purchased and went under a new ownership.
During that transition phase things were a bit chaotic, but it wasn't because of the staff or doctors, they were doing the best they could. (Yes, I too had a

I have witnessed however, more than once, where a patient came in the door with a nasty attitude that radiated from them to everyone in the waiting room. I've seen them start out with an attitude toward the staff, and I've seen the staff just take it and remain professional. I seen/heard these type of patients start out with a combative or ""the world revolves around me attitude"".
I've over heard some of these patients in adjoining rooms or a hallway, very clearly (and loudly) interrupting the doctor, unwilling to even listen to what he/she is saying, & displaying demanding, entitled attitudes, and the moment they meet any hesitation to meet their demands, I've seen/heard them go into the ""offended"" victim mode, and I've gotten the strong impression that they were going to be very vocal to everyone they know, everyone that would listen, about ""how horribly they were treated"".

I haven't witnessed this kind of behavior at this place for a good while now, so I'm thinking maybe a majority of those patients have moved on when they weren't able to dictate their own treatment, and their displays were met by Dr Ju's, no-nonsense, ""I refuse to break the rules and put you at risk by caving to your demands"" demeanor.

I've also personally, firsthand, had situations where I didn't understand something, or had questions about potential treatment & didn't have all the information, or even questioned Dr Ju's decision/treatment/procedure. Never one time did he react the way some of these reviews suggest.
Even in those times I was questioning, not understanding, or in painful frustration, I tried to show him/them the same type of respect I prefer to receive myself.
EVERY ONE of those times, Dr Ju was willing to listen  AND CONSIDER what I had to say, ask, question or explain. He truly wanted to understand my concerns, questions, conditions and needs.
He was willing to explain his thoughts, reasoning, decisions & treatments.
With both of us being willing to ask questions, RESPECTFULLY confront misunderstandings or confusion.... with both of us willing to explain our thought process and reasons, we've been able to understand boast his treatments & reasons AND my conditions, concerns & needs much better. That has resulted in finding FAR better medications and solutions for my specific needs. Quite frankly, it's resulted in the best pain management I've ever had.

I realize no one is perfect, everyone can have a bad day or whatever. I realize that sometimes a patient doesn't get what they expected or deserved.
I acknowledge that some of the negative reviews may be 100% legit. I know I've certainly experienced some very poor service & treatment at OTHER pain centers/doctors. So I know firsthand it can happen, & what it's like.
(especially if you have to change doctors/locations and all they look at is the medication you're seeking refilled, with no knowledge of your conditions, treatment history, what's been tried & failed, etc. and they treat you as if you're just another junkie trying to get pills for your next buzz or quick cash...)

Yes, I understand that stuff happens, patients do encounter such nonsense....
But I've never encountered that with Dr Ju, I've never seen/heard anyone else treated that way by him, or his staff.
In fact, I've personally experienced the exact opposite.

So yes I do recommend this center & doctors. I also recommend people listen to the doctor, ask questions, show the respect you want to receive, and realize/trust his decisions are in your best interest.|Dr Ju and the staff were amazing. They were incredibly friendly and prompt. Dr Ju spent about 45 minutes with me teaching and developing a plan to help manage my chronic lower back pain. I can't recommend the team at National Spine and Pain in Cary enough.|I'm glad my mom got her refund from this place two years ago. I definitely would not recommend taking anybody to this management center. When I took my mother her at 1:30pm, it was a horrible experience. First, we had to wait over forty five minutes until she had to be examined for back pain. Secondly, when she got into the back room for examination, they would not give her what she wanted, like prescription medications for her back. My mom was fed up with this poor treatment along with the regular check up procedure including lifting her leg up. It was so obvious that neither the receptionists nor the doctors cared about her needs. That wasn't godly at all. As a matter of fact, we Shook the dust off our feet, and went somewhere else for change. Like I said before, I definitely would never recommend this place for a visit any time soon. This is poor business and unprofessional, so... we definitely would not want to waste time with this so-called service. Let those doctors and receptionists play the victim all they want, but at the end of the day, they reap what they sow. I'm sorry it took me two years to post reviews.

I was terrified to go to pain management and they really helped put me at ease. I appreciate all of their help and their knowledge. I like that they are no nonsense as well because I don't want to be in a place that just caves to people who try to push their weight around. They truly care about not making the opioid epidemic worse.|I'm giving it two stars because of the information below.
If I had to rate just the doctor I would give her five stars.

I've been on hold for almost 45 minutes.
I even called the Lexington office and was on hold for 30 minutes till I just gave up !!! SMH
They finally answered the phone and they told me they were having computer problems so she had to reboot the system but I would think if no phone calls are coming in or something you would notice it right away I am so not impressed with this and it's not the first time this has happened !!!
I'm so mad right now !!!

As for Lori she is a amazing !!! She's very nice, she's very knowledgeable, she pays attention to all the details and she jumps on everything that needs to be done immediately.
I don't know why so many people complained in the past maybe it was a different doctor.
If you want to see a great doctor this is the person you need to go see.

You definitely will not regret it and you will not find another doctor as good as her.

I even drive 1 hour to see her because she's so good.|I've only been going to the pain clinic for a short while but so far everyone has been very friendly and I can get an appointment in a short period of time. The nurse practitioner Lori Love put me on 3 medications on my first visit which has helped me so far. She also made a schedule for me to get spinal injections which I'm very excited about getting. None of my medications are narcotics or opioids which I'm happy about. They only mask the pain by altering how your brain perceives the pain. I believe that the shots will act on the source of the pain. So far I'm loving the experience at the pain clinic.|The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because of the kindness of the nurse we had. Otherwise, they treated my grandmother like a drug addict who needed to be monitored constantly. I must note, my grandmother barely takes the pain pills prescribed to her. If I see her taking one, I know that she is in extreme pain and really needs it. Not once had she ever abused her medication. It is also worth noting that they wanted her to come in for spontaneous drug tests. Due to my grandmother's condition, she is not always able to get out of bed. Yet, they told her if they called, she would have to come in that day, no matter how she felt. All in all, it was a ridiculous experience and we will not be going back. My grandmother was so upset with how she was made to feel.|Lori Love told me to forget all the issues with my lower back. Wanted to give me injections which I did not want. She is a quack and should not be allowed to practice. Will never go back.|HORRIBLE! Loreen Morris insulted my niece. She yelled. She made a fist. And she had no idea who she was talking to.

Dr. Mike Brown is simply the best.  The rest of the staff is professional and took care of our needs.  Thank you so much!|I have been going to this clinic for nearly two years. I have found them to be extremely helpful to me in relieving my pain issues. Dr. Patel is very compassionate as is Ms. Box. I have also seen Ms. Bowen for awhile too, but she moved to their Fayetteville location. They have all been supportive in trying different avenues to relieve my pain, not just sticking with one coarse of treatment. The appointments do sometimes take awhile, but I am ok with that since, when it is my turn to see them, they take their time with me and make sure we have covered everything relevant or that I feel is important to discuss. If you are honest and genuinely there to get pain relief, they will help you. Ms. Box is always kind and compassionate to me, and the treatments I have had with Dr. Patel have been helpful and he is great. They also have yoga classes which you can try and they are on a donation basis for cost, but I live about an hour away so I have not taken part in them because of the distance. But I think it is great that they offer this. I drive all the way from Raleigh to go here and it is worth it to me because of the kindness and care, as well as the effectiveness in helping me reduce and manage my pain.|From start to end everyone there was very rude and treated me as if I was there  just for a prescription. I was asked about my back pain and then continually interrupted, then was told that my medical notes only showed lower back pain. I have had severe back issues for 20+ years and knew that was not true. I went back to my primary physician 2 days later to ask for another suggestion. I also asked what notes were sent over. My doctor read everything off. There were other people in the physician's office that I spoke with that had very similar experiences at IPS|I have been going to IPS for quite some time now and my experiences have almost always been helpful and pleasant. First I went to Jeri who stood behind me 100%. She fought for me and did her very best to help me get the care I needed. Well as she should have , she got promoted and I switched to Kim Box. I've read the reviews on here and I really don't know who stole her name tag the day these reviews were written but Kim has never been anything but kind and respectful. She's attentive, direct, and she listens. I feel like she's really on my side as a patient. I urge anyone who has been to her to give her another chance. Maybe she was having a rough day. IPS has always been by my side since day 1 and I can't imagine going to anyone else for help. Although I look forward to the day I don't need them anymore I'm grateful they are there from Joanne at the front desk to Kim. They are all wonderful people and great medical professionals.  I only gave them a 4 because their phone system is terrible but their new web app does a great job in helping me communicate.|My experience with Kim Box was horrible. I have never been treated so unfairly. She was very rude. She wasnt personal at all. She seemed as though she didnt care for me because I was African American. I was referred to this office because my regular physician couldn't prescribe the quantity of my regular medicine that I had been taking for 10 years. Mrs Box refused to give me my medicine. She treated me as if I was a liar. She actually called me a liar in so many words to my face. She should be in the law enforcement field instead of the medical field.

Doctors are being paid money not to prescribe opioids and the govt and DEA are terrorizing physicians who do prescribe them. Despite this, the providers do everything possible to help people live lives full of quality and comfort. Every day that I am able to get up and live a full, active day, I owe gratitude to this clinic.|Went Thursday sick. I paid $68.75 was sent to car. No one came. Went back in and he receptionist said can't see me sick. By Monday my money was gone. He jumped up to hit me because I wouldn't give more money. He yelled at me and upset me so I fell and got hurt in waiting room them threw up from nerves coming home. I still had to pay more money to get another appointment. Very unprofessional! Do not give these people cash money!
As far as the doctors, great but reception staff are thieves!|My mother was referred here by her doctor and she went to check in with the receptionist not wearing a mask and then patients were seated right against one another in a small waiting room! How is this even a doctors office when no precautions are taken at all? She even asked to wait outside because it was crowded and was told no they were not going out there to get her. She felt is was more of a place to get drugs than a place to get help for your spine!!!! Please don't send your elderly loved ones here! We will be letting her MD know to not refer anyone else here.|Dr. Cross listened to me, he didn't make me feel like I wanted medication for any other reason than to have a better quality of life. There are also rules to go by when receiving the medications. Those rules are not hard, but he is very serious about them. No surprises, he lays it all out on your first visit.

All of the care providers have always been super nice,  take time to understand my concerns and always provide very satisfactory care.   I am often seen earlier than my appointment and rarely wait more than 15 minutes.   Different individuals have worked the front desk over the years but all have treated me respectful and courteously.|There was a mix up with my appointment because I originally cancelled the appointment due to the poor reviews I had read but I received a confirmation text on Monday to confirm my appointment. I called the office as soon as I received the text to see if I was still scheduled for a Tuesday afternoon appointment, I was told I was still scheduled for an appointment and to arrive 30 minutes early. I decided to go to the appointment and give the office a chance. When I arrived for my appointment 30 minutes early, the front desk person was originally rude but as we kept talking she become friendlier and polite. She said that she did not have me down for an appointment, I explained that someone the day before confirmed I was still on the schedule. That time slot had not been filled so she put me back on the schedule and had me fill out the new patient forms. I finished the forms 10 minutes before my appointment. The PA sent the nurse upfront to tell me my appointment would have to be rescheduled because it was scheduled for 3:15. I explained to her it was 3:05. She said she would talk to the Pa but the front office person said she would not see me. I would need to reschedule. I explained I had originally cancelled the appointment due to the bad reviews but decided to give them a chance.  I did not reschedule. If I could write this review without having to submit one star I would. I never write reviews but this was the worse experience at any doctor's office I have ever encountered. I would not recommend this facility at all!!!|I have been a patient at the Sanford location for a couple of years. I have no negative complaints. Neema has always been very nice and professional. She has worked with me and, keeps my pain level tolerable. If any changes in my condition, she tries her best to help. I really appreciate the time she takes to listen. I have never had more than a 15 min wait.|I would otherwise give this facility a five, but the receptionist makes me want to give it zero stars. She is cold, rude, and sometimes makes me feel like a child who is being scolded, despite me always being polite and following the instructions asked of me. Sanford is much closer for me, but I go the extra distance to Lillington simply so I can avoid the Sanford receptionist. Recently I had to drop something off at the Sanford office, took my son with me, and he said as soon as the lady looked up at him, he knew she was the mean one I had warned him about.
I certainly understand customer service jobs are NOT EASY, and I am not taking away from this, however, when I mentioned this issue to the staff in Lillington, they said they heard this complaint many times before me. That is telling, if you ask me.
Please consider getting a receptionist like the staff in Lillington. They are incredible! Also, every other member in Sanford is amazing and makes me feel cared for!! It is only the main receptionist who makes me waste my time and gas simply to avoid her. Sad.|I have been going to them for a while and the Sanford office has been nothing but very kind to me and professional. I have never waited longer than 30 min for my appointment and my dr gives me all the time I need during the appointment. It is never rushed. They treated my mother and she recommended them to me. Now the parking is brutal at times but manageable. It all depends of the appointment time. They have several offices throughout the area. And I have experienced wait issues and staff problems from other locations but not at the Sanford office. So.....other than that. I am very happy/pleased with them.|I have been at this clinic for over 5 years. Sure there are times you wait longer than 15 mins but overall I am seen within 30 mins. On the flip side to the wait, the PA takes her time with me and makes sure I am good before she leaves. They don't rush me out like other clinics do.... As far as the Staff, they have been very understanding and have treated me with respect. People come there in pain and are not the nisest people to be around. So for those that say the Staff is rude, I can say that has not been my experience|They are so rude every single visit. If I could give them a zero I would. They don't care about the patient at all .You always wait at least 45 minutes. Just to wait for the PA in the back. They told me they sent my prescriptions to my pharmacy but when I called the pharmacy they had nothing. I asked the PA for my prescription at the appointment and she made herself very clear. She HAD sent them over. Treating me with such anger like how dare I ask her again. So when I called the pharmacy and they did not have it. I called the office and they told me oh she sent you with a written prescription.  While laughing at me in the background. Finally she sighed and said ok I'll send you an email prescription over. I've went in for tests and came back for my results. They didn't have them!!! They did this twice then finally told me oh we will call you. They NEVER did and when I asked at my next appointment the PA became angry and told me she had talked to me about them. Which isn't true. We are looking for a new neurologist and if you read this you should too. Only send someone you hate here .|First off, the lady at the desk is very very rude. The doctor or PA whoever it is I see talks 5 minutes and gives me my pain medicine and that's it. I am not pleased with this place at all anymore. The parking is terrible.

It's not appropriate to push politics in a doctors office. It's not on silent and not everyone wants to be forced to hear this while waiting for a doctor. Put it on silent or change to something normal like most offices. This is not the time or place for this.|Beware, this clinic bills itself as a hospital. This is an extremely important detail because 9/10 insurance companies bill differently for this tax ID  (the patient is responsible to pay more in this situation if the deductible has not been met).
The reason I'm rating 1 star is not my experience in office, but because I called Duke billing PRE-PROCEDURE to ensure I was covered, which they stated I would be in full. Was later charged $3500 for a steroid injection (which my insurance didn't fully cover, left with over $1000 bill, solely because this clinic bills itself as a hospital).
Hope this saves at least 1 person money.|I have always had great care with Duke Hospital clinics until my recent experience with this particular clinic. The staff is not consistent with their providers and their policies such as counting pills upon follow up visits. I experienced 11 visits and saw 6 different providers making it challenging to build a relationship with a provider. I was humiliated during my last and final visit. Situation is too long to write about but the front desk clerk is not properly trained to handle patients who are upset and did not know the protocol for finding a member of the leadership staff to handle a sensitive patient. The providers never offered other avenues for pain management, just medication. I will not be returning. However, I will note that the nurse staff are excellent and compassionate.|My wife goes to this clinic and sees Doctor Smith. They have given her first class service. The staff as well as Dr Smith are compassionate and extremely proficient. I would (and have) recommended this clinic to anybody in pain. I am blown away by the bad reviews posted. Our experience has been excellent. This does not mean my wife is no longer in pain. It means this group has made the pain more manageable. There is no cure for most cronic pain.|Clearly they're in it for the money, because they no nothing about CHRONIC PAIN!
You can read  about PAIN all day everyday but you will never no what it's like! Dogs are treated better than humans in pain.|I've been going to this pain clinic for over 10 years!!
I've had 4 back surgeries and scheduled for a 5th next month.  I've taken Zanaflex for 8 years, written by this clinic.  Since they took away my pain medication because of this ""crackdown"", I've been trying to just get if from the back doctors I'm still seeing or primary care, but it's always written 1 month at a time.  So I figured I'd go back and get it filled there where it's been filled for 8 years.  When I called, woman was very abrupt, saying I hadn't been in for 8 months and  couldn't even be seen because I was considered a new patient!!  Duke is just hell bent on screwing the people over that need the help the most.  I mean, this is not a narcotic, but a ""short""  acting muscle relaxer.  Its ridiculous!!  For ""pain management"", this is NOT the place to go!!|I have been a client of this clinic for some time now. Have not been satisfied since the practice who had been there left to establish a clinic in Wake Forest. Since Duke's doctor's have taken over the clinic I've had a different care provider every time I have had an appointment.

Dr. Dave was never an empathetic ear for me during my visits with him and he would rarely talk to me for even 5 minutes during my appointments, consistently interrupting me throughout. During my 2nd visit last April, he requested that a nurse draw my blood. This nurse, and the entirety of his nursing and admin staff, was very kind and made me feel heard during all of my visits. However, after drawing my blood, she requested that I hold the first vial of my blood while she filled a 2nd vial. Being squeamish around blood, holding the hot vial made me incredibly woozy and nauseous. I told the nurse this and she said I looked pale so she ran to get me some water. While she was gone, I vomited in the sink. The nurse came back and was very empathetic. However, she was shooed out by Dr. Dave and he took this as an opportunity to scold me for being so anxious. I apologized before he said anything, then Dr. Dave said, ""You cannot go through life with this level of stress and anxiety. If you continue like this, you WILL feel like you are 55 years old when you turn 40. You cannot keep going like this,"" before quickly leaving the room. To me, this was a disproportionate reaction to what happened, and in that moment, I needed his help and empathy which he provided me with neither. I saw Dr. Dave once more before switching to another provider at this same office, just to explain to him the effect his words had on me as they were swimming around my head for weeks. When I confronted Dr. Dave a month or two later, he dismissed my words and DID NOT apologize in any way, shape, or form. This was appalling behavior to me as I was in tears talking to him about how this made me feel. His main response was that I ""didn't understand what he meant by that."" The provider I saw after Dr. Dave wasn't much better and I was very unhappy with the care provided to me from this office until my last visit in late 2023. I moved back to Western North Carolina in 2024 and the care that I've received here is night and day compared to this office. As I said, the admin and nursing staff here (especially Crystal, she is the hero of that office) were always empathetic and willing to help in any way they could. However, I was more than disappointed with the doctors in this office and how little they seem to care about some patients.|If I could give this place a -0 rating I would my experiences with this place has been horrific no compassion whatsoever I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Total waste of
my time energy and money and for what
absolutely Nothing! These folks have no care in the world about me as a patient and having a background in healthcare I have never and would have never worked in this field if my heart wasn't in it and for some if not most of the staff here they need to go work somewhere they can play in the field like a park and pray one day they're never in need of any kind of care because God don't like ugly and ugly is all you'll receive going to this place.|My experience with them was extremely disappointing. Right from the start, they were unwelcoming and treated me rudely, which made me feel uncomfortable and unwanted.

Adding to the frustration, they never picked up their phone when I tried to reach out. It was impossible to get any updates on my reports or even have a simple conversation with them.

They made false promises of calling me back the next day but never followed through. The level of customer service was shockingly poor, making it one of the worst experiences I've had.|Wow this clinic is really professional Alan the PA is really informative and attentive to your needs she even requested blood work to check my kidneys and liver, which is something doctors should do when your on long term meds. Also my experience with Crystal who runs the office was great as well wonderful person, Both had great bed side manner. which is important when your not feeling well.|In contrast to the scathing review above, I was treated as I would have expected for a walk-in cold contact - the receptionist/scheduler was professional, courteous, and pleasant.  My contact and insurance info was taken on the spot, and  I left with an appointment card (for within a week) and instructions on how to proceed.
As appropriate, I'll post comments after my actual consultation with the doctor and/or PA.|Omg , I love the staff at this Morrisville office !

I would give 12 stars if I could !|Incredibly rude staff. I should've trusted my instincts after being spoken to disrespectfully over the phone TWICE. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. And no, the reason for this bad review isn't because I'd have to pay upfront even though my insurance covered my visits there, which is information that could have been given over the phone if the staff CARED enough to give it. (""Ohhh, sweeetie, we don't take Blue Local ""*snickers with the rest of the front staff*""Barely anyone takes THAT insurance"")  I'd be more than happy to cover those costs, as I am at my current doctor,  if I was spoken to respectfully even ONE time that I spoke with someone there.  I was given no information about that AT all, even though I asked about it. And I was spoken to incredibly disrespectfully every single interaction that I had with them. I'm not even sure why. From the second I called in to make an appointment, to the moment I left, this location was unprofessional and rude. I was stared at with disdain from the moment I walked into their facility and it's completely unacceptable.
The call I got to confirm the appointment was from a woman named Sarah, and it sounded the same as the woman who I saw at the front, but I can't confirm if it was her or not that was rude to me.  I do know that there was a blonde girl directly behind the young lady who was rude to me, that stared at me as if I'd grown a 2nd nose out of my forehead and I'm not exactly sure why.  Take a picture, ""Sweetie"", it will last longer.|I've been seeing Dr.Dave off and on for a decade now. All I can say, is to disregard the negative reviews that people leave.

Definitely recommend if you are having body pain.|My fiancee has been a patient here for over 10 years and today the new NP dismissed her from the practice all because they didn't like the fact that she takes medication for her anxiety alongside what they prescribe her here. This has never been an issue or brought to her attention as she knows how to take all her medication safely. I seen another review stating another patient was dismissed because the same NP advised her, she needed to go off her pain medication. This is a pain management practice, what are they doing to these poor patients?!?! This is not at all professional and it needs to be addressed. Not to mention that Dr. Spivey retired without even telling his patients. Very unprofessional and very dangerous for anyone who takes medications to abruptly stop. Someone needs to talk to her or us immediately.|My father has been a patient at this location for many years. They've always treated him well. Recently, new ownership converted this clinic to Wake Spine & Pain Specialists. Dad has inoperative spinal damage and lives with incredible pain 24/7. He now suffers from dementia as well. After seeing the same two doctors for many years, he now sees a different physician for every appointment. In light of recent memory loss, this has become very problematic. He has severe anxiety and difficulty preparing for appointments, without having to see a doctor he is not familiar with every month.

I believe the amount of care that any pain patient requires, includes a regular physician who knows their patient's needs. It is difficult enough for an elderly, disabled, and severely injured individual to make it to the clinic every month. The clinic now seems to have more patients than they are able to provide appointments for.  As a result, we sometimes wait more than an hour to see the doctor. An old man who forgets where he is, & can't sit longer than 15 minutes without agonizing pain, deserves better care.

Though we did not care for the arrogant, and rude, Dr Spivey, things don't appear to be getting much better with new ownership. My dad was taking a medication that insurance no longer covers. After asking the doctor to make it clear to the insurance provider, that this is the only medication that works for him (which we discovered these last 2 years), they seem to have forgotten to do so. He is now SUFFERING, day and night, with no relief from pain and confusion. This medication costs $1000/month without insurance. I truly fear for his life as the replacement medicine seems to be a catalyst for his dementia. 

I believe America's healthcare, DEA laws, and insurance companies are doing more harm than good. I hope physicians, and nurses, come to understand the impact they have on all of their paints and continue their personal research in pain management during the opioid crisis.

I am grateful for the care this clinic has provided for my father in the past. I hope this new clinic improve, for the sake of all patients who live in incredible pain.|My overall experience was great and easy to understand. The provider did take the appropriate steps to ensure me of the  best treatment plan needed. Im looking forward to a successful outcome.|My husband started going to this office when it was Preferred Pain Management. We both loved Dr. Spivey and had no clue issues with his staff. Since Wake Spine and Pain took over, it's been nothing but Trouble. Because of slack office/scheduling personnel, my husband is now two months over due for his RFA treatment. He's in excruciating pain and we can't get anyone to refill his meds. We will be looking for a new Pain Center.|I have had great service and help from Wake Spine and Pain Specialists since starting to see them in January 2023. Everyone has treated me well and my provider Jessica Salmon NP has been fantastic. She is compassionate and listens to all my issues.

(They were supposed to call me, but never did). Every phone number either says the office is closed, or sends me to a disconnected wireless number. The one working phone number sends me to someone's voicemail, and I left many messages but never gotten a call back.

Update: After these fruitless months, I finally got an appointment. The wait times are long, but I was reasonably pleased with the staff. The nurses were all helpful and friendly, and they did a really good job of addressing my pain issue. One doctor was great, but he's gone. The other, not so much, but he was adequate.

Not sure what happened here, but when I went to the Greensboro location last fall, they were tremendous.  This place is supposed to be a place to go to assist with pain and to help with issues, but this time around, I have never felt so neglected and ignored from any ""doctors"" office, EVER.  To sum it up:
May 8: requested an appointment online
May 15: FINALLY received a call to schedule
May 29: appointment.  The two individuals I saw before the doctor were nice and attentive and made me feel better than I did during the 2 minutes the doctor spent with me.
They received my MRI results and after a few days I finally called them to see what was going on. Did I need to schedule a follow up? Was someone going to call me? No, I was told the doctor doesn't look at the images until I go in there again. I was told a scheduler would call me back to schedule a procedure... they ensured me someone would call me back.

A couple days later: got a phone call, still waiting on insurance.. whatever I know it takes a while for approval.

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY: JULY 11TH: over TWO MONTHS after my initial communication to get an appointment and get in there to get help and some relief for debilitating headaches and neck pain...
Someone called me to schedule my procedure.
My insurance approval was only good until July 11th.
Since all of this, I've scheduled with an actual neurologist and have gotten the help I needed.
When I told the lady (Marie, Maria(?)) that I went elsewhere and I was so unhappy and wasn't returning.  She said she'd put a note in my file. When I said okay yes you need to do that.....
SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

I AM SO DONE WITH THIS PLACE.
I will make sure every single person that I can share this with will know just how horrible they treat their patients.
Absolutely no empathy at all. It's unbelievable and I'm disgusted by the entire experience.|Drove a full hour to be turned away, when I arrived on time. Don't waste your time scheduling an appointment. You won't be seen.|Thankfully transitioned from Bethany to this office about 3 years ago. Michael Roche takes care of my daily pain management and is terrific, but I also have had the good fortune to visit Dr. Faller (wonderful communicator and gives painless injections), who took the practice over several months ago.  There were uncomfortable adjustments that had to be made but all were for the enhancement of the Dr/patient relationship.  These people are very educated, kind, thorough, experienced and I have to say: even though some days I would like to change the parameters I must adhere to to remain a patient here, I know the quality behind their decisions about my care far exceed my personal opinion.|Coldest most unprofessional doctor I've EVER encountered.

I could not begin to tell you. How many times I called in just 1 day to speak to a human being but I can tell you. It was more than 20 and a course of 4 and a 1/2 hours. I spoke to somebody who told me that it would be taken care of. And them knowing I was out of medication still left me at the beginning stages detox.|If I could give 0 stars I would. The hours of this facility are not accommodating. Any option you select over the phone leads you to a robot. I've called 5 to 6 different times and never get through to an actual human. I have left messages every single time with my call back number and have yet to receive a call regarding my questions. I am my grandmothers health power of attorney and made it very clear they were to call me to schedule the appointment.
After the 7th time calling and leaving a message, I received a call from Robin, the referral lady. She informed me that they called my senile grandmother instead. (My grandmother has no recollection of this)
At the end of the call Robin hung up abruptly and did not apologize for the multiple inconveniences she had caused my grand mother and I.
Needless to say, this staff and company do not care about their patients nor the people taking time out of their life to take care of their love ones.
I would never recommend this place to anyone.
Oh, and a plus : my grandmother was referred here because she had fractured her back in 3 locations as well as had a collapsed lung. Her primary doctor Agape, does not prescribe pain meds.
So my grand mother has had to live this last month in severe pain, with no idea of when she would be receiving help.
Thank you Greenbrier!|I gave been going there for few years and always been treated with respect and compassion,  I had reconstructive back surgery a full 10 hour surgery and have serious chronic pain issues with 4 rods and screws from top to bottom of back and Billy Smith and Harry Cross always treated me with compassion and found the right medicines that have made my life a little more manageable. I can function more as a person without the chronic pain I was having!! Thanks to both Doctors for making my life alot more functional!!|I had an absolutely horrible experience. The African American woman sitting at the front desk was rude before I could even get started. She said because I was new, I was late because I should have gotten there earlier. I explained I wasn't ""new"", I transferred from the Garner location. So then she says let me see if the doctor still will take you. She stays in the back for a long time then come back and ask me for my money. I ask first, well is he going to see me? Shakes her head yes. After all of that, the doctor, questions why I have not had a pain stimulator put in my back. I told him because my insurance said I had to have other things first!! NOW LISTEN UP ALL MY AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE HERES THE KICKER, he looks at me and says don't you have Medicaid? I answer no and tell him what I have. He then says what is that insurance? I answer it's through the hospital. He asks Oh you work at the hospital? I answer, No my HUSBAND does, he's a doctor. He then says, well there's not much more I can do for you!! So yes, I have filed a complaint against this doctor and this establishement. Horrible, horrible experience!!!|My husband has been going to Greenville Pain and Spain for many years. We love Joanne!!!! She takes time to explain all aspects of his health and pain management. He has a very rare form of cancer.....most oncologists have not heard of it. He was the first patient at the Leo Jenkins Cancer Center to ever have it! She researched it until she understood his diagnosis. She has been so sympathetic to his situation and continues to try to think of things that may help him. Mrs.Joanne is a very caring but professional person. I've read some of the comments and it sounds like to me, most people do not understand the new NC laws pertaining to pain meds. We have had experiences with 2 other pain clinics and they ALL count your pills. They are held accountable for someone taking their medication incorrectly! Not only can they loose their license, but could face jail time if they don't follow every letter of the new laws!! One Office we went was like they were herding cattle....the huge waiting room was always full....we waited anywhere from 3-5 hours EVERY time!! At Greenville Pain and Spine we have never waited over 30 minutes!!  The only thing that I think they could improve on is their phone system. But Joanne told me to use their ""my chart"" app to send her messages...it is called Healow. It works much better!! If you have an issue, just discuss it with your provider. There may be a reason or a solution. I thank God for all the help with my husband's pain!!|When I first started going to Greenville pain and spine I loved it. I attended this office for almost 2 years. It was quite to distance from me but I didn't mind traveling just to be under their care. One time I caught the flu and had to reschedule and they called me a week worth of meds in so that I wouldn't have to go without them on top of being sick with the flu, another time my tire blew on the way there and they are very strict on there 15 minutes late at most policy so I rescheduled for the following day and everything in my eyes was fine. Almost a year later my son picked up a stomach bug which all of us had the weekend before so I called them to let them know I was going to have to reschedule only to be told that if I rescheduled, I would be discharged. I had to carry my 2 year old son with me on a 2.5 hour drive with him puking just not to be discharged from there. The last time I went to this office on my drive there we ran into a fatal car accident where they weren't letting any traffic through, I called them immediately to let them know what was going on and see if maybe they could give me an extra hour as there was no way I'd be there within their strict 15 minute policy. Once again was told if I wasn't there I would be discharged, the receptionist shakenna, is rude constantly, she always acted as if she completely hated her job and would take it out on her patients by being rude and judgemental to everyone. Even though I was told I would be discharged I still drove the entire way there to see if there was anything I could do, Shakenna refused to let me see my doctor, I asked for a last prescription as the withdrawal effects of my medication are very serious and shakenna very rudely told me no, as I walking out to leave the medical assistant at the time stopped me and said Joann is going to write a prescription for you if you'll just have a seat in reception and wait. So I sat there waiting for them and sobbing as I felt so mistreated and I hadn't done anything wrong, when she handed me the prescription it was for half my regular dosage, and half the amount I would normally take. They only lasted a little over a week. I left that practice feeling right abused. I transferred over to the office Tracey Smith new location and I've never been happier with them. No more dealing with people who are rude. The receptionist there Shakenna should be fired. She is not a people person and should not work with the public. I later figured out I was discharged because they had a few to many patients and because I had medicaid I wasn't a big enough profit for them. I don't want a doctor who sees me as a paycheck I want a doctor to genuinely cares for me and my well being and health.|Joanne is the best doctor I have ever had! They have the best staff, the most caring an understanding women I've ever met!|I'm writing this review for the fact I can't believe anyone would have anything bad to say about Mrs.joanne! She is the type you do your part and she does hers! I will never forget how valued she has made me feel in times in need..she also has a line she draws to those who takes her kindness for weakness..I love her as if she was my mom..in my eyes an  in disguise..I could go on and on about her kindness and generosity!

The office staff however  will be the reason I choose to go elsewhere.  They are never friendly and act like they don't even want to be there much less help you.  They have canceled multiple appointments last minute or made me reschedule once I have already made it to my scheduled appointment.   It should have been a red flag when I showed up for my first appointment and it had been canceled prior to my arrival even though the letter they mailed to me for my first appointment had the date and time written on it yet I was told it had been canceled and they couldn't give me a reason why.  I've wasted multiple hours taking off work for them to cancel or reschedule me.  The doctor recommended a second injection which i was never able to get.  After showing up to the appointment for the injection I was told my injection would have to be rescheduled because my insurance had not given authorization yet only to be told when I  tried to reschedule the appointment that the type of injection I was getting didn't require a prior authorization. Just sharing my experience in an effort to save others from wasting their time trying to be seen at this office.  I've worked as a medical assistant for 20 years and from my personal experience it seems like this office is just poorly managed and their front office staff needs better training.|My husband is experiencing neck pain and headaches.  He had an initial appointment with Dr. Patel last week.  Dr. Patel recommended a procedure that we were not familiar with so we both asked a number of questions about the procedure... what it does, risks, results, what if doesn't work.  At first Dr. Patel answered our questions.  Then he seemed irritated and abruptly said if my husband wants to proceed, schedule at the front desk our way out and he walked out.  I believe that our questions were reasonable.  The website states that Dr Patel  ""takes time to understand each individual's needs and concerns"".  That was not our experience.  We won't be back.|Dr Sakla is the best doctor I have met in over 20 years. Even after having surgery on my back didn't work. I was in severe pain. He helped me. I wouldn't trust any other doctor except Dr. Sakla and his whole staff. He is kind and listens to me and helps me to manage my pain. His injections and medicine have helped me when no other doctor would. Him, his nurses and receptionist's make me feel like family. I have had issues in the past where doctors didn't care, but him and all of his staff are truly amazing. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be able to even function on a daily basis. I am truly blessed with Dr. Sakla and his whole staff. They are wonderful people!!! God bless them all and thank you from the bottom of my heart for caring so much!!|About two years ago, I called the office because the prescription I received from a PA was not valid.  I had made two round trips  in a day from GA to SC trying to get the script filled and ended up with nothing.  When I called the office about it from a drug store with the pharmacist standing next to me,  the lady who answered was very rude to me and hung up the phone.  I went without medication for the second time in a year.  So, I submitted a review that stated the truth about what happened.  Soon after,  I received a letter from the pain center stating that I had been dismissed because I left a negative review.  So, I sent a letter to my doctor with a list of complaints with documentation and soon received call from a Practice Manager. She was very nice, apologized to me, and assured me that ""These matter would be dealt with.""  I can see from recent reviews, that nothing has changed.  I am seeing a wonderful doctor in Athens now and the difference is like night and day.",2024-12-16|2025-01-16|2025-02-26|2024-08-21|2024-01-24|2024-06-22|2022-11-21|2022-04-26,5|5|5|5|1|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJA_mc4tRtWIgRsqdYZyWQxzI,47

Ms. Amanda is amazing. She's ordered every test possible and referred me to other specialist to handle my pain. I am extremely grateful for this Dr office and Amanda. I would recommend them to everyone!!|I have had a great professional care experience with Pain and Neurology. For almost 10 years Dr. Bianca and Mr. Malone are kind, caring and helpful. I have 11 herniated disks , disk disease and spinal spondylosis. My days are challenging. Thanks to their help I am capable of enjoying my many Grandchildren. I also have extended family visits for 6-9 months out of state. Changing from my provider in Mississippi and back to Pain Neurology has been flawless. During Covid my Dad became ill and my elderly Mom broke her arm. The doctors and staff were extremely helpful with keeping my treatment on schedule.|I have never experienced a terrible service from doctors office. They literally don't care if you have brain tumor or intracranial hypertension. I have been trying to get MRI of my brain for almost three months and they did not care about puting a Rx for it. They wasted my time two three times going there and keep telling me we will get back to you. I am determined to write a letter to the board regarding their patient negligence and stress they put on patients. They have lots of bad reviews because whoever the owner is doesn't care about patients satisfaction  instead care about money. I can't imagine how they treat people who are not well informed and older. I have never reported or wrote a letter to the board for any provider because I understand how hard it is to obtain a professional license and I tried to be patient with this clinic for the last 5 years, but they got worse in the last two years and enough is enough.|You will not believe the experience that I just had. Never had an experience like this before with my provider Amanda she is amazing by the way. Well, today I was placed with another provider whose name is Bianca Goo. This, lady was a trip. Rude at its finest. She is a very a very bad asset to the company. First, she walks into the room without using standard protocol (knocking) right away her demeanor is off. Then, when she asks the patient questions... she then scrutinized me. I will explain a little further she had asked me about a certain medication of mines and when I explained that I still be hurting... She then cuts me off and says ""don't talk to me like that"". In return I had to hold on to Jesus...I had to take my glasses off and tell her the devil is a liar and we are not going to do this. Because at this moment I am take aback by her approach. Mine you I never said anything but about how I am taking the medication around the clock and since the weather was bad for the last two weeks it was like taking raid. To get such a disturbing response blew me. ""When  I made a statement and said we are not going to do this"". She hops like a rabid animal and told me to find another provider and was cursing all in the reception area. I casually walked out all while she is in a rage. When, I say they hire anybody and anyone in these offices nowadays. is mind blogging. And she fits the description of anybody and anyone!. Please hire people that shows empathy, integrity, decency, class(professionally) and most of all have great interpersonal skills. But the devil was not going to steal my joy!!!. That was definitely on her to look unprofessional and deranged. Everyone else was super duper sweet though one bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch for me!!! Hopefully no one else will experience this type of behavior.|I would give them a higher ranking only because I have been with them around 10 yrs... So I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET A CERTIFIED LETTER FROM THEM SAYING "" IHAD VERBALLY ABUSED THE STAFF & I WAS NON COMPIANT WITH OFFICE POLICIES"" OK  HERES WHAT REALLY HAPPENED..... I went in there on the 10th to see Misty.... We agreed to put me on different pain meds.... She should have known That I would need  a PA with this new medicine, Heck I should have known.....So i called them & of course HAD TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.... So this went on& on & Over the week-end too.... By then they should have known that I was then having WITHDRAWS...DID THEY CARE, NOSo  by then I WAS GETTING UPSET, I was in sooo much pain.. So I wrote them a note. We went back & forth, I really could not believe I was being treated like this....I had to go through 3 different pharmacies... I finally got my meds(that sucked)I FINALLY GOT  5 MED'S ON THE 19th... So do I NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER?? IT TELLS YA THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS YA ARE WITH A PLACE,  THEY DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YA.... SO NO, No I would not recommend this place!!! Plus I want to say I was getting injection in my NECK & BACK , I TRUSTED THEM.... I really didn't know what they were injected, I know it helped with the pain for a few days... Well it was STEROIDS & NOW I HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY BACK FROM THEM.....NOW WHAT, ANY SUGGESTIONS FROM YALL, where is a good place to go,?That all I need is someone to just keep filling my meds....|Dr. Bianca and Sonja are absolutely amazing. They truly care about their patients and went above and beyond for me. I can't say enough good things about the entire staff!|This office is GREAT!!

No, they are not going to just give you pain medication. All of the staff have been great to work with. Melisha Vannet was very caring and compassionate. When I would have questions she would usually respond on the portal within a couple of hours. I also see Dr. Mahajan for back injections. He does a great job explaining the procedure and is very good at what he does in the procedure room. He has even personally made sure I get my injections on time when dealing with the insurance company, which has been greatly appreciated.  If you are looking for ACTUAL help with pain, I would highly recommend the Sanford Pain Center.|Update due to response:  I would just like to say Thanks Sanford for going out of your way to provide an automated response with a phone number that no one answers.   Thanks for showing how much you care about not helping patients, I expected exactly this, NOTHING!

One would expect a Pain Management Clinic to actually treat pain in patients.  Well, guess what?   NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.   What I received here was a 20 minute discussion on everything but what would help me.   They talked about all the wonderful procedures (which I have already done elsewhere) Acupuncture, Steroid injections, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, blah blah blah and so on.   All things that they can bill in repetition every 3-4 months like clockwork and offer no long term treatment or cure.    NP did not even bother to look at MRI scans, did not bother to touch me or examine me in anyway.   I am sure glad I drove 6 hours to spend an entire day wasting, once again, time and money on the farce that is Sanford Health Care.   Save your money, get proper treatment elsewhere because it won't happen at Sanford.    What you will get is an endless supply of bills and ZERO progress at treatment or better, a Cure for your problems.|I want to share  my experience  about  pain clinic the staff nurses doctor who takes care  of me are great and always  follow  up if theirs  a problem  with pain schedule  thanks for a job well done!|The First words the NP said to me was "" your here because of the powers that be""!  It went down hill from there. Never once, no not even close did she ever look at me.  She read all the tests/therapies I had tried in last 12 years.  As I was leaving she said as she was staring at the door/ ""oh dang- he wants a physical - well, get on the table"".  Checked my heart squeezed her fingers. And on her way out pointed to shelf said you can take a card.  Hers wasn't even up there so nurse got one for me so I could tell my Dr.
crazy thing- I cared for my daughter who was in critical ,morbidity state- Mayo had requested hospice.  New Year's Eve she wanted to attend church services.  I got her ready - had to change her fentynal patch which required removing a clear bandaid similar to what's placed over an IV - it is put onto a tape that is on her skin, as her skin was dying off and couldn't be touched.  Of course- had a pain test , and was told I was no longer Allowed pain mgmt .  My Dr couldn't believe it.  As the test was extremely minimal.
For me I didn't like the insinuation - especially considering my daughters medical status - which my PCM was aware of.
I would hope someone may care however what I got from NP OR PA in pain mgmt.
It comes from above-- so doubt this will even be read.  It's ok. My strength comes from above- only nine listens|NP at the Fargo Pain Clinic did nothing for my chronic elbow pain.

His office told me to call the pain clinic in 1 week if they hadn't called me to let me know of the date they had made an appointment for the shot.  10 days later I had not heard back from the pain clinic so I called them.

The process will take a very long time and they will call me after they decide whether they will help me or not.  I was under the impression that my neurologist was just scheduling a shot.  The curt manner with which I was spoken to and dismissed was disheartening.  I hope that this isn't representative of the care that I may or may not receive.

Has drastically improved her cognitive abilities and speech. I would recommend Healing with Hyperbaric's for anyone suffering TBI or concussion. Very caring facility.|I had a excellant healing experience. Dr Luistro and staff were top notch in every way. I highly recommend them.|I really should give 10 stars for this place: 5 stars for hyperbaric treatment itself-- assisting the body in healing itself without  anything invasive.  LIFE CHANGING!  And 5 stars for the team at Hyperbaric of North Dakota for the way I was treated.  They did everything they could to make this whole process as comfortable as they could.  The balance of ""professionalis;m"" and ""personal"" was perfect.  I will continue to recommend!|Healing with Hyberbarics has changed my life. 8 months post concussion I was still struggling with memory issues, constant headaches, ear pain, balance issues, and blurred vision. After 5 treatments I feel better than I did pre-concussion! Zero headaches, balance has returned to normal, but what I am noticing most is the ""brain fog"" is completely gone. Hyperbarics has been a total life changing experience for me.|Healing with Hyperbarics is the best!  I cannot say enough good about the whole process let alone the results.  My whole family are huge believers.  The improvement we have seen after treatments for sports injuries, concussion as well as surgeries is amazing.  They are extremely knowledgable, caring and compassionate.  Dr Denham's research and effort that she has utilized in treating all sorts of symptoms is second to none. Fargo is so lucky to have this clinic in particular to serve our community.  We hands down recommend it and strongly encourage you to try it if you are considering hyperbarics.

Before he even got his lab drawn they are trying to sell him on hundreds of dollars of drugs and hardly talking to him about himself. It's very one sided and just seems like a drive through testosterone company. I have bad vibes.
This place feels predatory to men, they don't talk about any kind of lifestyle changes, don't, sleep health, or any other kinds of help for mens mental and physical wellbeing.
From the time we walked in until we left they were trying to sell us a bunch of hormones, without even seeing his blood test results.
I'm insulted that they are so freely giving very serious medications to men and not talking about the overall wellbeing of their mental and physical health. I think it perpetuates the stigma of ""man up"" and not allowing for room for more alternatives.

It's giving pyramid scheme, it's giving vitalife shakes.

Also any currently clients you can buy all of the supplements they sell for cheaper on Amazon and natural groceriers.

This is a scam for sure.
It makes me sad for cisgender men as a whole, you guys deserve better than to be pumped full of artificial hormones and exploited for money.

On doing more research, I'll add to this review that they requested he fasted before his appointment, and didn't have sex or masturbate for 72 hours. Looking i tk this sex and masturbation do not change overall testosterone levels unless he just had sex prior to the blood draw which would slightly lower the testosterone, and fasting has been seen to reduce testosterone.
With that, it only solidifies my concerns about the business as a whole.|My first initial visit today was a great experience with very professional staff.

I'm down 40 pounds and able to maintain a healthy weight. I recommend Limitless male to my friends that are struggling with their weight.|This place is a complete scam! They signed you up on a monthly membership and then don't actually send you out any meds unless you call them even though they know they only give you a certain number of meds.

Their hope is that you will completely forget about it and continue to get charged. Then when you call to cancel, they tell you you can't cancel unless you talk to somebody and that it's the fine print of your contract

Highly recommend  Dr. Heidi!|My experience with Dr. Ben has been incredible and every visit deserves five stars! His office is very clean and welcoming. He is so passionate about his job and is probably the only chiropractor I'll trust to fix my issues. He is very caring, friendly, efficient, respectful and a kind person who listens to your whole story and provides feedback and guidance for your issues. He is very detailed and better than other chiropractors that I've visited for my issues. Dr. Ben offers an incredibly knowledgeable and effective approach to the treatment he offers patients. What makes him unique and a pleasure to interact with over other chiropractors is his approach. Most chiropractic clinics do one size fits all adjustments and push you out the door. Not him. He's genuinely interested in helping you and is willing to address all your issues and questions to makes sure you understand exactly what is going on. He takes his time to explain everything, and his explanations, reasoning, and treatment plans are easy to follow. He focuses not only on the short term but on the long term benefits of care. Additionally, he is easy to talk to and is able to make suggestions of both big and small changes to patients' daily lives to help them achieve greater outcomes on their wellness journeys.

I initially started seeing Dr. Ben over a year ago because I woke on a Saturday and had extremely bad neck pain and I couldn't get out of bed on my own. He was willing to go into the office to see me right away! Since then, I have been seeing him for issues related to my shoulders, neck, back, and anything else that comes up. He has been correcting many issues that I have been facing. I've struggled with cronic pain for over 20 years so I've had my fair share of physical trauma and pain that I'm used to. I'm in my 30's, but because of my pain, I felt so much older. For years, my pain brought down the overall quality of my life. Now, I don't feel like the same person I was when I first visited 701 Chiropractic. He gave me specific instructions on how to actively improve my shoulders. I can't say it enough, it has improved my life, and my pain has reduced significantly.  My treatment is ongoing, and I have a lot of faith and confidence in his approach.

I highly recommend 701 Chiropractic. They definitely deserve more than 5 stars!
I feel like I've finally found personalized care. Dr. Ben is amazing and is the best chiropractor I've ever been to! I've had a great experience, and I'm very satisfied with the treatment that I have been receiving. You won't find a better chiropractor in the F-M area!|After mouths of no success working with another local chiropractor, I was referred to 701 Chiropractic & Rehab by a coworker.   Dr. Ben scheduled me a appointment to visit with him and go over the back issues I've been having. The first visit was extremely thorough! Lasted over an hour. Ben explained to me how he would like to treat my back issues and we got to work. Each visit I was making improvements. After 6 weeks Dr. Ben had me feeling great!

Dr. Ben's hours of availability made life so much easier. Early evening appointments and even Saturday appointments.

I highly recommend 701 chiropractic & Rehab.|Ben and team are incredible! He treats different than any other chiros! He wants to get to the root of the problem.

Dr Martens performed OMT on my neck and  shoulders which alleviated 90% of my tenseness and pain.

I have been in extreme pain for nearly four years, and the last year has been the worst yet. My experiences with doctors and treatments up to this point have not been stellar, to say the least. My first ketamine treatment with Jackie was just about a month ago. I was extremely nervous, however, Jackie walked me through it step by step. You can feel that she cares and that makes for a safe and supportive environment. The results were amazing and better than I anticipated! I am now walking without a cane for the first time in nearly a year! My pain level has been reduced significantly. I am able to get around and do things with my children again, which I have missed dearly. I cannot express how thankful I am for Jackie and the work she is doing! It has helped me to regain my life.|After reaching out to Jackie to discuss Ketamine Infusions I knew I needed them. Jackie was comforting and factual. She did her research about my CRPS, chronic pain, PTSD, and depression with anxiety. She made a plan that fit all of my issues the best. I felt at ease knowing she didn't just use a template to decide the amount of infusions I would need, but instead used my doctors notes and my own words to learn and understand how much I was suffering. The first time I met Jackie in person for my first infusion I felt like I could breathe again. She talked so calmly and since I am a nurse as well we talked nurse world which helped ease my nerves as well. Jackie has definitely found her calling in life. There is no doubt in my mind that without her, I would still be suffering day and night. Since finishing my last infusion I have been able to run around with my two small kids. They have noticed that mommy isn't sick all the time, too, which makes the expense and traveling all worth it. I text Jackie and tell her the little things I've been able to do to remind her she's found her calling in life. I would encourage others to look past the ignorance of ketamine and research how it truly works. It can give you your life back just like it gave me mine back.|I received very good care from Jackie, the nurse anaesthetist who runs Ketamine Care Clinic. She really covers all the bases for monitoring you during treatment. I have been to other ketamine clinics in the US and Jackie's setup is top notch. When I'm in treatment, I know I'm in good hands. She is professional, empathetic, and kind. I'd recommend her to anyone.|Jackie is an amazing provider for Ketamine treatments!
These treatments have literally changed my life!  (I actually have a life now!)  I feel so blessed to have such a wonderful, knowledgeable woman bringing these hard to find treatments to the Bismarck/ Mandan area!
If anyone is having trouble with Depression,  Anxiety, Pain etc. Please give Jackie a call.  This worked for me when NOTHING else did!|I have struggled with anxiety and depression for the last 13 years of my life. And as stress wore me down the anxiety grew and the depression got so bad I cried about EVERYTHING. Yes, everything!
Happy cries or sad cries, it didn't matter. I just couldn't get through even a few hours without crying. Job stress had gotten intolerable, so I cried often and realized I had to stop living this way. After the first 3 infusions I noticed a difference. After the initial 6, I was a different person. I've gotten 2 booster infusions since and moving on to a third. I am so thankful this treatment is an option for us here in Bismarck because of Jackie. It's great having a medical professional that doesn't want to cram useless pills down my throat like the rest of the industry. I highly recommend Ketamine Kare Clinic to anyone that can't continue living their life the way they currently are.

Despite there being a bit of a time gap in completing the 6 initial recommended treatments (due to financial constraints), I don't feel that I had any backslide in my progress. This treatment may be compounded with more traditional approaches such as therapy etc., but if you've been through it all before like I have (though I've never been hospitalized) it isnt inherently necessary if the thought of that is annoying to you. Yes, it is expensive, but some health insurance coverage does cover it by reimbursement at least partially, you just have to file the claim yourself.

The medical staff was very pleasant and attentive maintaining a smile throughout the visit. As far as Dr. Mosley is concerned, I like his demeanor. He was thorough and offered a treatment plan that I thought made perfect sense. Additionally he was open to my ideas on my treatment as well. Suffice it to say, I now have 2 more appointments established for treatment, I believe this should more than indicate how I feel about his ability to help me along my journey to a pain free life.|Both Capitol Pain locations New Albany and Pickerington are high class medical facilities with staff that are trained, experienced and equipped with all the newest procedures in pain management.  They closely monitor patients to be sure they are providing the best care possible.  Both Sara and her assistant are caring medical team.
5 Star service.|First of all - the staff is friendly. Everyone says ""hi"". Secondly - I have not had to sit in the waiting room past my appointment time. Mind you I show up a few minutes before my appointment, but still I don't have to sit in the waiting room very long after I arrive. Dr Mosley is friendly. He put together a treatment option for my lower back pain right away. I don't want to take narcotics for the rest of my life - so I was not going there for that. That made me happy he is trying to solve my problem with other treatments before discussing surgery. I have always been leery going to pain management clinics because I have had such bad luck in the last 24 years I have been sick. I developed Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was 30 years old. I have had joints replaced and I was in a wheelchair for 4 years at one point. Once I got out the wheelchair and got new knees so I could walk/drive/be independent again - my back pain kicked in high gear. I have been living with this back for about 12 years. I did actually see a surgeon a couple of years ago (Ohio Health Westerville) who fat shamed me. Dr Mosley did NOT fat shame me. Not once did he mention my 250lb 5'4"" body and suggest I lose weight and my back pain will go away. My goal is to get this back pain under control (without a slew of narcotics) so I can go to the park and walk - so I can use my exercise machine for longer then 5 minutes because my back is killing me - so I can sleep in my bed (and not on the couch) because my back is not killing me. I think Dr Mosley can help me with that.|Staff was friendly,  understanding,  and professional. I was very impressed with my 1st visit today. Dr. Mosley listened and is assisting me with my Pain.  I would highly recommend.|Today was my first visit at the Capitol Pain Institute.  I was impressed with the staff as everyone smiled, said hello and helped when needed.

I don't know why I couldn't have kept Courtney. She really cares about her patients. A false positive is what happened to me there. If I was a Dr I would have gotten another urine to make sure the results were correct. I'm really upset for being accused of something I didn't do. I've been going to Hillsboro location since 2017. This that happened to me seams so shady. I wonder if it was because I
had  wasn't taking the shots in the back of getting oaba stimulator put on ?  When you release your patients because it's all about the money I guess. I told the truth and God knows it. I was in the hospital for five days and the Dr gave me Ativan because they had me on a invasive ventilator and they gave it for me as bedtime. I had 90 0/0 carbon dioxide in my lungs. Do when I got released on the fifth day I had an appointment with Jordan and so she took urine. This past Tuesday I had another appointment and she told me I had Klonopin in my urine. There is no way. Pretty sure it was the Ativan. I am going to suffer for sure. My spine is in bad shape. The pain is terrible. I'm still in shock. I don't understand it at all. It seemed like Jordan was always waiting for me to fail. I really missed Courtney. She really cared and explained everything to me. She helped me so much. As you know Courtney I won't be coming back, but I truly want to thank you for everything you done for me and your kindness. God bless you all and God bless for the false positive test. And Jordan never said a word about the Ativan being in my urine, which it should have been there. Which I took while in the hospital under Dr care. Just that Klonopin was in the urine. What's up with that ? Shouldn't Ativan been in the urine ?|The staff treat me with respect and are genuinely concerned about my pain.

However at my last appointment I was billed for ""copays"" for visits I was NOT present for. So the dr. can discuss care with the team, is what I was told. And my medication was due the following day to be picked up from my pharmacy. The pharmacy says they are missing a code for billing... I have texted, called, emailed, as well as had my pharmacy call. No response! I'm a week overdue on my medication that absolutely causes extreme side effects if stopped. I will be changing doctors and calling state on these people. This is absolutely unethical and abandonment of a patient.|The drs are good but the staff don't seem to care. They are super slow. I was told they didn't take my insurance,  but they do. They apparently didn't want to bother looking into it first. So i was charged $100 copay for no reason. And now I cant get it back?!? Not happy with this place like I used to be.|It's all hurry up and wait. I've been waiting weeks for a referral and all they do is make a note. Someone from the answering service made the referral yesterday and sent to the wrong place. Noone was willing to help me again today. The staff in the office treats us like cattle. Usually too many patients while understaffed. If I weren't so close to what I need, I would find a new clinic.|Do not come to this office! Dr. Tayeb will spend maybe 2 minutes in the room. Will gaslight you and disregard your problems, pain, and experience in the office. You will wait at least 3 hours for each appointment. And his staff is disrespectful and inappropriate in front of patients. They do not care about you. They just want your money, and every other pain patient in the tri-state apparently which will be lining the walls because they schedule more patients than they should take.|I have to go here every month and it is my least favorite thing to do. Not handicap accessible (how is that when everyone there is hobbling around in pain?) they book a million appts a day which means you will WAIT an extremely long time in a small, crowded room. Staff tries, but there's no way to manage the chaos.  Their obvious goal is to get as many people as possible and there's never more than 2 people at the desk. This leads to most people being frustrated when there, and makes for a tense environment in general. we've had to correct billing with our insurance because they were billing for services not received (urine test for example). It's a mess and since so many people need pain management there's no motivation to focus on the quality vs the quantity of care. It's a pill mill, don't expect anything more.|First visit today. Waiting room was small and crowded and very chaotic. Not a  relaxing environment if you have a long wait to see the dr., and long waits are apparently common. Patients were using their cell phones in the waiting room which I thought was extremely rude and no one said anything to them. The wait time was long. I waited about an hour before I saw dr. Exam room was cold as a meat locker. I was confused about the need for images from my CT scan. I wouldn't have gone through all the trouble to get a CD of them if I'd known they weren't needed. Dr. Tayeb himself was very nice.|I love going here.   Dr.  TAYEB and his staff are exceptional and treat you with courtesy,  respect,  and you feel so well taken care of when you leave this office.   Joanie, the receptionist, really goes out of her way to make you feel welcome too. They are always so very helpful everytime!
Dr. Tayeb is so knowledgeable medically, and always impresses me every time.   I have had several different types of procedures done by him that always seem to work way past my expectations.   I am just so impressed by him.
I would always recommend this office to anyone who is in need of pain management.   I drive an hour each way for appointments,  and that long trip is so very uncomfortable at times, if he wasn't such an excellant doctor I would find a pain management that's closer,  but because of the excellent treatment I receive here, it is well worth the long trip.
I actually have felt so blessed since finding Dr. Tayeb because he has helped to give me a so much better quality of life,  since I've been going to him.|The practice as a whole has issues that plague most Pain Management Offices, it is an overwhelming field.

A couple of them very good they were surgeons.  It's after the surgery & different difficulties arise this is when your experiences with Drs arise.  I have been seeing Dr. Munir for a few months he is an excellent listener also explains situations thoroughly.  So far all treatment has helped.  I would also like to say the staff is excellent and extremely helpful.  I would recommend to anyone.  Satisfied Patient Sherry|I would recommend this facility to anyone. They don't judge you.

I seen Dr. Wang today and she was so caring and actually listens to what the root problems are.  I have had 4 surgeries on my knee and bulging discs in my lower back.  She really cared about me as a patient and my underline pain. Unlike other places I have been to, they treat you like a human and don't discriminate bc of your age. The staff is so sweet and caring as well. The clinic is very clean. Thank you Drs and staff for caring and being so nice to your patients.  You make me feel very comfortable there and not nervous.|I have a genetic disorder that generates chronic spine pain. I have been seeing Dr. Munir off-and-on for many years. Dr. Munir and his staff are not only effective at alleviating my discomfort but they are kind, concerned, and pleasant to interact with. I enjoy my visits not only for the relief that they provide but because the office treats me like a person, not just a patient.  They earn my trust with every interaction.|After having an accident in the Air Force more than 30 years ago, my back started to hurt like it did more than 20 years ago when a doctor at Walter Reed Army Hospital gave me 3 shots over 3 months to stop the pain.  My sister recommended Dr. Munir.  After initial visit and exercises were not relieving the pain,  he gave me a shot, and relieved the pain.  He is a doctor that will listen to you and give you the treatment for you, without going overboard|I have always had an active lifestyle. At age 42, I developed pain in the lumbar & sacrum regions. The pain worsened over the next year to where my lifestyle changed. I could no longer exercise or perform household tasks. I went to an ortho surgeon, who prescribed 18 PT sessions to strengthen my back/abdomen. The PT released me from therapy because I did not have a lack of strength in my back/abdomen and that my pain must come from elsewhere.

So, I went to see a chiropractor and after adjustments, he told me a story. His wife had suffered from chronic back pain. As a doctor himself, he had done research and came across a pain management doctor in the area. He sent his wife to that doctor and after several treatments, she was pain free and had remained pain free to that date.

That is how I came to meet Dr. Munir. I made an appointment at Southwest Ohio Pain Institute (SWOPI) and by this time, I was waking up around 3:00 AM in such pain that I could not fall back asleep. I had sleep deprivation and passed out during my first appointment. His staff was excellent and I felt like I was in the right place. This doctor was going to help me.

Dr. Munir completed a physical exam and asked questions to understand what triggers the onset of my pain. After a series of evaluations, he informed me that he did not believe it was an issue with my spine, but rather an issue with muscle spasms pulling at my spine, resulting in both muscle & structural pain. Dr. Munir outlined a program, which included steroid shots, a low dose muscle relaxer and a series of stretches to be performed multiple times a day that would target underlying muscles not often reached through traditional stretching. After a few days of following his program, I experienced my first good night of sleep in close to a year.

After about a month, I was experiencing about 50% relief, but I wanted to shoot for the stars and get back to my active lifestyle. Dr. Munir suggested adding red light therapy to my program. His studies had shown that when used in conjunction with steroid injections, the red light therapy (performed twice a week for 8 weeks) would add additional pain relief. And he was right, it did. Not 100%, but by that point my pain relief was about 85%. It was well worth the time and the investment.

Again, not one to give up or settle for anything less than 100%, I tasked him with finding that additional 15% of pain relief that would allow me to sleep each and every night, perform household tasks and get back to exercising. Dr. Munir suggested radio frequency ablation (RFA) and thus we started on the evaluation process to determine where most of the pain stemmed from. We decided to treat my left side first - it was a rather simple 20 minute procedure, local anesthesia, performed in the office. I walked out and soon realized that my pain was gone. It was 100% gone on my left side with about a 95% improvement on my right side as well! I could immediately tell the difference in muscle tightness from my left side to my right side.

I came back in a month to see Dr. Munir for treatment on my right side. By then my life had changed dramatically. I had been going to the gym, I had started running again and lifting weights. I was sleeping through the night - every night - and feeling rested in the morning. My physical state had improved and so had my emotional state. I was ecstatic with the results! I couldn't believe that I'd spent a year seeing different doctors (by the way, I also saw a neurologist, a rheumatologist and got a second opinion with another orthopedic surgeon) and Dr. Munir was only 5-minutes from my house.

It has been several months now and I am 100% pain free. I am also free to pursue the things in life that bring me joy. Thank you, Dr. Munir, for taking the time to ask me thorough questions and for spending the time to properly evaluate my physical issues and for developing a treatment program that was unique to me. Thank you for sticking with me and for not brushing me off because there wasn't a glaringly obvious reason for the pain.|I have been a patient of Dr. Pham for almost 6 yrs now.

I've been in pain since I was 10 years old without finding anything as helpful by itself.

However, the fact that they lied about being willing to take over my gabapentin prescription resulted in me having to go through my GP for it, and it was reduced to 2/3rds of what it was before.

They also apparently put an arbitrary limit on how high they will increase the pump, which they informed me (with a little prodding) is determined by the pain management facility, and is not a limit set by the DEA.

Their arbitrary decisions which seem to have no goal other than to minimize their own liability at the expense of their patients are incredibly frustrating, and make me question how long-term a solution Premier actually is.",2025-02-18|2025-02-11|2025-01-15|2025-02-06|2024-11-09|2024-08-06|2025-02-17|2023-08-31,5|5|5|5|1|1|5|4,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",77.75|71.5|70.25,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do you have any Doctors that prescrbe Suboxone?","No I don't.

Also watch out for the monthly visit to his office to get your medication refill. They hand you a medical Waiver to sign. Then you find out for the first time you have been scheduled for a procedure.

We will strongly recommend that you report to Ohio Department of Health Infectious Disease Division if you believe you have contracted an infection from a procedure, this will ensure that an audit is carried out by the department to help improve standards.
Unfortunately, the reviewer did not give any name and the alleged named, Fraud Systems Management LLC cannot even be traced, and so we are not able to contact the patient or their primary care doctor to ascertain the veracity of this review.

At Oracle Pain Clinic (OPC) we take pride in providing excellent patient care, and we take that responsibility very seriously!

Respect is mutual so we expect our staff to be respectful towards patients, and be attentive to their needs, and we expect our patients to show that mutual respect.

I made the switch to the Middletown location and couldn't be happier. The staff is amazing, especially the receptionist Stephanie, she knew my name from day 1 and is so sweet. Also Darcy, the Xray tech, is always smiling and in such a good mood whenever I get any injections, and it puts me at a little more ease.

Down to earth. Gets to know you as a person. Takes her time talking to you, gives her opinion and listens to what you have to say. Never once have I felt uncomfortable there. The whole office has been welcoming and polite.

I highly recommend using Premier pain treatment for your pain relief.|I had dealt with back pain caused by disc herniation and spinal stenosis for years going without treatment because many doctors would not even look into my pain or take it seriously because of my young age. After having thoracic spine fusion (t10-12) I was referred to Premier for pain management and have made tremendous progress in terms of pain largely due to the doctors here actually caring about their patients quality of life and advocating for them when most won't. If you're someone like me who's been denied care or dismissed but dealing with chronic or post surgical pain then I'd highly recommend giving Premier a look and hopefully they can help you out as much as myself. If I could rate it any higher than 5 stars I absolutely would!|I have been going to premier pain treatment institute for a while. The staff has always been good to me
. I've always been very polite and nice.
Because of them my pain is minimal. Dr Danko is great. When I was receiving my epidural shot he was singing and it was calming me down and I asked him to continue to sing, he tried to think of a song. I loved it. For the first time ever since I have had my injuries and whatnot. That epidural shot worked longer than it ever has on me. The epidural used to not work or only work for 24 hours. The most I had ever gotten out of it before was 3 days. I don't know what he did or how he did it but it lasted for 5 days. That epidural shot took care of my inflammation for 5 days. To say I was impressed as an understatement.
I hope that Dr Danko and the staff continue to be as awesome as they have been to me.
Please keep up the good work.|Dr Wray is great but I was cut off of medication by Paul Seigwald which threw me into major withdrawls.

His lab girl is very rude also. Asked her a question about why getting a second urine test since I just had one  and her answer was "" JUST PLAN ON GETTING ONE EVERYTIME YOU COME"" .
Well I told her I won't do that. Drug test for me are $150. Out of pocket everytime I get one and they are supposed to be random. Anyway.... THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. Also no business doing bloodwork.  Was misdiagnosed there. Was told I was anemic and I was not AT ALL!!! My doctor saw the results of bloodwork and said in no way I was anemic!|First visit went fair. Basically, interviewing for a new Pain management.  Very strong opinions on pursuing alternative therapies. Examples: blocks, ablation, physical therapy, medical massage, chiropractor and more depending on the insurance coverage you have. Doctor interrupted the intake with the nurse, to me it set the wrong tone. Staff is very busy. Be prepared for a 2 to 3 hour wait time.  If you are going there for treatment, choose this place. If you have alternative motives other than trying to gain a better quality of life then find someplace else.  My hangup was injections that I had and failed but they insist you start over when transferring into their practice. Keeping my opinion open since it is a new experience and I hope a better one with these injections. Not a guarantee to work but a promising one if done correctly.

Just moved from Fl to Ohio and have been seeing a pain management doc for 6 years. I am not a patient here but I just called to schedule a new patient appointment. The receptionist explained that they only do steroid shots there (didn't even ask medical conditions). But I do find that his response was quick and effective unlike other offices. I've had over 10 surgeries bc the military screwed up the first one. Every doctor here wants to do more surgeries or shots. I'm not a huge fan of opioids either but it's the only thing that's helped with the pain. So 3-5 stars for being quick, direct, effective. I wouldn't be opposed to shots but if that's all they can offer then I've been there and done that with my previous pain management doc.|Dr. B was very careful about explaining everything to me, which is of the utmost importance to a scientific person like myself. The other thing that is drastically different between the way Dr. B went over my MRIs and X-rays with me and the way other doctors have done was astonishing. He saw things on my radiology that other doctors have seen but never noticed before. He had a good idea of where to start and I'm very satisfied with my SI shots because he had the right idea. My pain has lessened a great deal and without pain killing drugs, which I've been anxious to avoid. I'll be returning to talk with Dr. B about my other pain issues and I'm confident that he'll be able to help using the most recent and advanced techniques. In addition, his staff is superior, professional and friendly. The office is quiet, nicely decorated and relaxing. I could not be more pleased and optimistic about being able to keep working well into the future, thanks to Dr. B's careful attention to the kind of detail we should all expect from our doctors.|I have had several lumbar and cervical epidural snd facet injections over the years.  I have had no adverse reaction, the injections were expertly placed and have provided tremendous relief.  They have kept me functioning.  The staff there is wonderful and professional.  Dr. Buenaventura also offers minimally invasive procedures that may stave off major surgery.  I highly recommend Pain Relief of Dayton!|I've experienced back pain for quite a long time until one evening it became so unbearable I had to go to the emergency room.  After morphine, pain pills and an MRI, I was referred to Dr. Buenaventura.  He recommended the steroid injections to reduce the inflammation caused by my herniated discs.  After the injections I experienced a 90% improvement in my pain level within 3 days!  I went from using a walker to get around inside my home to practically no pain whatsoever.  Dr B's expertise as well as the friendly, knowledgeable staff is second to none.  I can't thank them enough for how well they treated me!|I went there inquiring about prolotherapy/PRP for chronic arthritis in my hips.  Dr. Buenaventura discussed other options and didn't push either one.  While only a day later, I have noticed a difference in how I feel and my pain in the hips.

I have to go back in about a month for a follow-up, but so far I'm very pleased.  The staff are really nice also, which for me makes a  huge difference in a doctor's office.|I am always greeted with a smile and seen promptly.  The staff is very professional. It is evident that Dr. B has a good relationship with them.

I've been going to him for a number of years and out of all of my other doctors that have for other stuff, he and his staff are the MOST CARING, COMPASSIONATE, UNDERSTANDING AND WILLING TO LISTEN to you about everything and will try everything to help you feel as close to normal as he can!! His appointments sometimes are late and that's only because of what I said above. So PLEASE don't complain if you are new and your appointment was at 2 and it's 3 and you haven't been called yet. Do like me, bring a book, play games on your cell,catch up on something ,watch part of a movie or series. Anything just don't complain . Because he will spend just as much time with you as the people before you if needed.|Best caring doctor I survived cancer and left with major issues. He takes time to listen and we have dramatically reduced my meds over time! He also fixes my back issues! Highly recommended|This staff and this doc are amazing!! I have an extremely detailed complicated health history. Everything from kidney transplant, open heart surgery, liver disease and an auto immune disease that destroys my soft tissue. So I've ruptured every major tendon in my body. I've had 19 surgeries on tendons alone not including surgeries for fractures because my disease also affects the density of my bones.

Everyone of my doctors are from Ohio state so that I can keep all of my medical records at one facility. However Dr. Lee. Is one dr I refuse to leave. I've seen other pain management dr and all they do is bring you in like herding cattle and urine test you and then wanna write your script and most of them already have that written before you even get there. Not dr Lee he's involved in every aspect of my care.

He ask every time I see him how this is going and how that is going.  Modalities that aren't even his field he takes an interest in. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have a doc that genuinely cares and takes the time to understand your complete medical history.

And then there's his staff Brittany and Amy they are phenomenal. Because of my care team being in Columbus and needing to see them every week there are times that make scheduling a night mare. Now understand that they have numerous amounts of patients that they have to contend with. But there's never been a time wether I've been in the hospital and has to reschedule my appt or had a conflict with appt that they have resolved or Been able to resolve with me. And while I know it makes it difficult for them they do it with a smile and even make jokes about it.

I can't tell you how much I recommend this dr and his staff for you pain management needs I wish I would've found him sooner in my treatment but I'm happy that I did 3 years ago. It's changed my pain management for the better. I just want to say thank you to the doc and his staff for the care I've received while here.|I am very grateful to be back as a regular patient with Dr Lee at the Pain Center.  I have gone to 4 different pain clinics, it was because I changed insurance plans that I even left his clinic.  In my opinion both he and his staff (especially Amy) are the best and most caring of anywhere that I have been.  So much so that I changed back my insurance to just plain Medicare so that I could go back to them.  The other places treated me poorly and only seemed to care about getting money, especially Cincinnati Comprehensive Pain Center in Fairfield.|I have been seeing Dr Lee for 10 years and I am beyond impressed with his ability to help even the toughest cases get control of their pain and improve their quality of life. Dr Lee is  conservative with medication treatment, offers in office acupuncture and epidurals, and most importantly, will get you back to living life.
Dr Lee is amazing at acupuncture for those looking into acupuncture and epidurals. I would highly recommend him.|I have been to 4 pain clinics with no real relief.  No one has given me so much attention, much less tried different approaches towards giving me some relief from the intense pain I live with.  He is the most amazing doctor I've ever experienced and I am thankful for him every day.|He listens, reviews xrays, MRI'S and other necessary medical records. Good pain management doctor and Amy is great especially when it's time for me to get an injection....lol...great at keeping the schedule on-time lately!!|Do not recommend they don't follow simple instructions. I went in for back pain from a car accident and they think acupuncture is an appointment treatment (is not) and when I explicitly told them that the bill should be sent to the lawyers handling the case, they waited until the case was completely over and then sent the bill to me, and have been harassing me for the past 3 years.",2024-03-05|2023-11-20|2022-10-20|2021-02-17|2020-09-02|2022-10-24|2023-04-11|2022-05-10,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJccSOwAlaQIgRsj6RfYy_LvM,26

They cancelled on a 81 year old lady with less than 6 months left to live who has a crushed back and is in incredible amounts of pain. Not to mention we've been waiting months for her to get in . Dr just looked at her file and canceled her appointment before she was ever seen by anyone from here .. I would avoid this place|I know this may sound cliche but if I could give no stars or negative stars here I would. Please, Please, Please do not go here or let one of your family get so called treatment here.

First off, when we tried to get an appointment we send an message through the website with not answer, called with no answer and left message with no return call. We chose to actually drive to the office and talk to someone about making an appointment. When we got to the office we were told to go to the second office behind the main office to talk with the scheduler. There were 4 employees outside smoking and were very surprised to see us walk into an unattended office. Conveniently the scheduler was not there at the moment so we left paperwork with another employee and left. Astoundingly we received a call the next day to schedule. Not surprised that the person I spoke to was very unprofessional, used street jargon, and was downright rude. Like she was doing us a favor. The appointment was set for a month out.

We get to the appointment and we have to wait an hour and a half past our appointment time to see Dr. Pauley who could not seem to get a string of two words out with out stuttering. She seemed very incompetent. She explained some prescription changes and scribbled instructions on the back of a piece of paper. Professional, I know. Then stated an addiction assessment was needed before any pain medications would be prescribed. She send a referral that was not sent until one and a half weeks later and the progress notes or report of the visit was not on any paperwork aside from the scribbled notes, or forwarded to the facility my mother resides. Of course they did not check to see if the referring doctor took our insurance. I know you are surprised that they did not. We contacted PEMCO to let them know this. Shockingly, it took about two weeks to get some sort of resolution regarding this manner. With an assessment that is so important to the treatment of a wide range of the patients that are seen at this practice they only have one doctor they refer to for this service.

AGAIN, DO NOT GO HERE FOR YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER, THEY ARE HORRIBLE FROM START TO FINISH. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH.|Too bad you can't select 0 stars!! I've been going to this clinic for 3 years, it was great starting out, seen Dr. Pauley only twice the other times it was a PA. I was sent to an addiction specialist, $150 out of pocket, he didn't accept my insurance, he told me he is going to recommend to continue treatment as they were, nope that wasn't going to happen. My own personal opinion, PEMCO & Dr. Mubarak have this little side deal going! was told I would only be getting injections, they don't work. Not one person. Will call me back or even email. So what was the point in sending me to the other doctor? Piss poor customer service, they have absolutely no concern for patient care. AVOID AT ALL COST!!
So we are going on 2 weeks with no phone call as to why they did what they did. But it gets worse, I was called in medication and was told to take for withdrawal symptoms, so I have low blood pressure, they called in a medication used for high blood pressure!! I kept getting really dizzy, seeing black spots and had to grab ahold of something so I would fall. Called left messages actually several messages and not one single person from this god awful office will return my call!! I've sent a complaint to the Ohio medical board as well!!|I asked why the federal and Ohio law that states pain patients in treatment on and before 2018 were NOT to be forced tapered but were.No answer to that one. I was taken from 100 mg to a 25 mg. .More people have died now from turning to illegal drugs and suicide, because of inadequate pain management
A pain patch fell into my dress, and I was blamed for that and she refused to prescribe after that.
I agreed to spinal injections with no relief,  but Dr.Dann reported to my family doctor I claimed 100% relief, which was absolutely untrue.
I requested to see another doctor in that practice but was refused.
When I told her a new Rx she prescribed nearly killed me, she dismissed me from the clinic.
That turned out to be a good thing because having a doctor giving bad vibes is not a helpful situation, besides being extremely unpleasant.
Her  insistence that my pain was caused by my spine was completely wrong and I've learned it's from an entirtely different cause.|Great Doctors, friendly staff. No problem with treatments.Been going here for a good while.Very Happy with Everyone at Pemco. Will recommend ... Always treated with Respect.|If I could give half a star I would, and the half star would only be because I didnt have to sit in the waiting room for very long. Upon Dr. Dann at this office walked in the room, before speaking to me or anything she says she wants to taper me down, then turns around a few minutes later and says she doesnt have all my medical records and needs time to obtain those. So she felt confident enough to know she wants to taper me but not confident enough to prescribe anything. I lost alot of weight and body mass after having my pancreas, spleen and gallbladder removed but my goal is to get the pain pump once I can add some body back (I was with an advanced pain clinic at IUH but the drive was becoming too much). She said she can still put it in, its just got to stick out. So im trading on pain for another. There is so much more I want to write on this review because I did go back for a follow up. I wanted to walk out in the middle of the appt. In the follow up I questioned her about making a decision to taper me down without records and asked if she documented that. You could tell me questioning her offended her and now the pain pump is no longer an option. Anything I suggested in what I thought would work for me, she denied. She humiliated me, made me feel 2 inches tall and has the worst bedside manner I have ever come across. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND HER AT ALL!!|Tammy Dann, DO was my physician at PEMCO in Dayton, OH. My experience with her was very unsatisfactory. During my initial visit with her she told me I would be seen by a physician on every other monthly visit. In reality it was their policy that a patient would only see their doctor annually. My biggest complaint however relates to my cancellation of an appointment with her on the day of the appointment, rather than the required 24 or 48 hour advance notice. I had appointments on 12/4/23 with the CNP and an appointment with Dr. Dann on 12/27/23. I had COVID during that month. I canceled the first appointment ahead of time according to their policy. When it was the day of my scheduled visit with Dr. Dann I got up and got ready, fully intending to keep the appointment but by the time I was prepared to go I felt the fatigue and brain fog that had been symptoms of the illness. I called the office and said I felt too ill to make it there and asked if I could reschedule. After a short hold on the phone the staff member returned to the line and said the answer was no and that I needed to make my next appointment with a nurse practitioner. I made and kept that appointment but learned that Dr. Dann had written a note in my chart, reducing my monthly Rx from Norco 5/325 three times a day to twice a day. She added that no provider was to increase either dosage or frequency and was not to prescribe to me between monthly visits. Dr. Dann had originally prescribed the Norco tid. My pain hadn't decreased in December and the reduction felt more like a punishment than an appropriate medical determination. The late cancellation policies I was familiar with in other practices for physicians and dentists charged a monetary fee which makes sense due to the loss of revenue from canceling too late to schedule another patient. Reducing my dosage for a reason other than providing adequate care strikes me as the unethical and punitive and has no place in healthcare. I changed pain clinics and couldn't be happier with the care I am now receiving. I would never recommend Dr. Dann as a pain management specialist.|Dr Dann had to have been the most discriminatory person I have ever experienced in a medical sense. Forms an opinion of you the first time you meet and just goes downhill from there. Believes herself to be above the rest of the medical profession. Discussing her with other doctors who have spoken of her unprofessionalism and poor results.

Definitely will refer people there.|Very impressed so far by the compassion and dedication of this Dr. He is a doctor that really gets to know his patients. The procedure was quick and painless. The entire staff was kind and made sure I was comfortable.|Everyone here is GREAT. They listen you your problems and treat you like a human. The injections they offer help so much I'd recommend them to anyone!|This is the most caring doctors office I have ever been to they treat you very good the staff are amazing. Even Michelle (NP)and Dr. G have done so much to make my back feel better than what it did when I first came here with the overall respect that they give you and how you're treated is just beyond greatness I would refer these doctors to anyone who ever ask me, they are the best There's nothing that they could do to make there doctors office better than what it is now . That's how great they are. Even the doctors office is very cleaned. Just love this place. Great job guys.
Thank you all,  Eva Lockard|I have had nothing but good experiences from Dr sadarshan. I was at the Va and they weren't treating my pain adequately. Came to this practice and didn't want meds and made that clear. I had a pain pump before morphine and baclofen and it worked well until I had to have emergency surgery for a Bowell obstruction and to save my life they needed access and removed it. Told him I would like it put in again. He agreed it made sense but due to me being a spinal cord injury patient with multiple spinal surgeries he thought it best to send me to a neuro surgeon at mayfield brain and spine. Got it implanted last month and first filled a few weeks ago and forgot how good it feels to not be in pain and groggy from being on oral meds. I know it will take a while to get the dosing right but they always make time for an increase when needed and I know of if I have issues the dr will always listen and assist the best he can. If you need a good pain doc who isn't going to just push drugs but will make an effort to actually treat what is causing the pain then look no further.|Phenomenal consistent care!
Very compassionate, comprehensive and caring group of medical professionals.
I've been a patient of Dr Sudarsan since 1995! I have two complex pain syndromes that have been well managed by Dr Sudarshan.

Very highly recommended|I've had two epidurals done by Dr. Sudarshan. His ultimate goal has been providing me total pain relief, and after the first one only providing me some relief he recommended doing another. The second one has provided me 100% pain relief the next day, and I had relief within hours after the procedure. This has dramatically changed the quality of my life and I'm very happy to have found him.|Dr. Sudarshan is the best Pain Management doctor I have been to.

I trust his judgment and value his opinion because he has the patient's best interests at heart. His goal is helping his patients and doing what is best for the patient whether it benefits his practice or not.|Dr McDowell is one of the best doctors I've ever had the experience of working with. He is very precise and knowledgeable in all things. His care for his patients is second to none. I wouldn't want to be under anyone elses care but his. He has helped me keep my pain under control for the past almost 18 years. Wonderful doctor and wonderful person. So glad and thankful to have came under his care all those years ago!|I have been a patient of Dr McDowell for a few years. My wife has also been a patient of Dr McDowell. I did not want surgery on my back. Dr. McDowell was able to to relieve my pain several years in a row, without the use of narcotics. And he also has a very good staff that works with him. From the good results I have experienced with Dr McDowell, I would recommend that you at least give him a try.|Waited over 90 minutes past my scheduled Appt time for an initial consult at Integrated Pain Solutions  to discuss options for ongoing chronic perineal pain after a surgery.  I got, at best, about  10 minutes of his time.  He went from zero to 60 regarding treatment recommendations skipping right to having electrodes inserted into my lower spine, despite my concerns about having anything that was invasive in nature. Oddly enough the manufacturer's rep who supplies the implantable device just conveniently  happened to be on site so I was shuffled off to him to ask questions.

I did not stay to ask much of anything but it did make me ponder how he gets such rave reviews if this is how a new patient is handled.

I was then surprised by a bill for the full amount of the visit instead of a co-pay because Integrated Pain Solutions said they were ""in network"" with my insurance provider but my provider is refusing payment despite me providing all info when the visit was scheduled.

I felt like my time was not valued, my concerns were not adequately considered before recommending a surgical procedure after I stated I did not want anything that required surgery and that it was really shocking that the very first consult went the way it did. It was a very disappointing (and now expensive) visit after hearing good things about Dr. McDowell.  If I could give 1/2 of a star I would have and that's only because he seemed like a nice person but my experience as a patient left me disillusioned and unimpressed.|I'm actually surprised that I have never posted a review before. Dr. McDowell has been my doctor for 18 1/2 years now! My accident was July 16, 2001 and he took me on as a patient and did my first spinal cord stimulator surgery in December of 2001. He has helped me through some of the most amazing yet difficult life challenges. He has done other surgeries since, yes. My most recent being Oct. 13 of this year. Had God not placed Dr. McDowell in my life I am not sure where I would be today! He has truly been a blessing to me and my family. I would and do recommend him to anyone that needs pain management.|Dr. McDowell was fantastic. I've been working with pain doctors for 6 years now and they have an extremely difficult job. Dr. McDowell is very patient, explains everything so you can understand it, is very professional and has a good sense of humor  that keeps you relaxed.  I only was able to see him once but he definitely made a great impression. I currently moved to Florida and I'm seeing Dr. Serria in Wesley Chapel. He has heard of Dr. McDowell and is very impressed by him.|Seeking care for a rare, chronic pain condition is scary, but Dr. McDowell and his staff provided me with an excellent experience during my initial visit. They took their time and answered all my questions. He is incredibly professional, kind, and knowledgeable on an extremely uncommon condition known as CRPS. I cannot express how thankful I am that I found Dr. McDowell. My only regret is that I did not see him sooner.|Dr McDowell is everything I could ever want in a physician.  At 40 years old, I was told by other pain doctors that opioids were my only treatment option for a debilitating back condition. After visiting with Dr McDowell, he assured me that there were several options available that may not give 100% relief, but they would greatly improve my quality of life. Today I am working full time and I'm able to participate in activities with my family that I previously only dreamed about. I still have pain, but thanks to Dr McDowell, it is manageable. He never stops looking for a solution because he cares for his patients.  I don't know where I would be without him.

I hope things are better there now. I wanted to share my experience so hopefully it never happens to anyone else. I went to Dr Moore for pain related to an old back injury. I was upfront about being a diabetic and was told no issues. Showed up at surgical center for procedure. Per their instructions I was told to NOT take my insulin because of no eating before procedure . Once in there I got changed and checked in with nurse. She took my sugar level and said she would be back. Almost an hour later she returned with the Dr. He told me he refused to give me the shots because my sugar was too high {197}. I reminded him it was under his orders to NOT take my insulin before procedure. He said he won't do the shot, said I was too high risk and walked out. Another Genesis fail.|Dr. Benjamin Gilliotte was so thorough and sincere. He did a nerve test on me. He was gentle and talked to me the whole time to make me comfortable. I would recommend if you need this type of testing to request him to do it.|Would probably try a different doctor. My 75 yr old father has a broken spine and neck. Pain is outrageous. These folks had us come in, pay co pay, then proceeded to tell us how sorry they felt for dad and while doctor was currently in surgery he would take care of getting us new pain prescription before the end of day. End of day came and nothing. I call office at open and 90 minutes later still get no response so I show up at the office. They proceed to tell me the doctor will not be giving my father a prescription and to take him to the ER and they'll take care of his pain. Yes, our pain doctor, Dr Moore, advised us to go to the ER. So Dr Moore takes our $45 and then sends us to ER for another co pay. Such a scam. Just worse that they lied to us and took our money. Almost laughing that our pain doctor is sending us to the Hospital to take care of my fathers pain. That's what you get in a small town I suppose.. this dude wouldn't have a business in a big city where I come from. Worth finding a different doctor or driving to Parkersburg.|Wasnt inpressed .

I have heard horror stories about other pain management offices. From being crowded, to the long waits, rushed in and out. Treated with no compassion. Dr. Batra spends time with you AND listens. If you are looking to help yourself with the best of the best. Dr. Batra is the Doctor for you. The staff is amazing. The waiting room is NEVER crowded. Wait time is short.

They listen to what is going on with you and figure out the best plan to take for every situation. I have a complicated case, but I never once felt like he has given up on me. I have felt this from other doctors in the past. Dr Batra is very knowledgeable on out of the box procedures. He will talk with the patient and actually wants your input on the treatment that he is suggesting for you. If you do not agree with what he suggests, he will come up with a different plan, with your help, to best care for your needs. The office staff will do anything to help get things done. Everyone at this office cares for the patients and it shows.|Dr. Batra and his staff are amazing. He is considerate and empathetic. Offers many types of pain relief. The staff is professional and kind. They have offices in Gahanna and Dublin. I would highly recommend this practice.|Dr. Batra gave me my life back!  He gave me hope when all I thought I had left to look forward to in life was constant worsening pain.  At 54 years old I felt like my life was over.  Dr . Batra and his staff are sweet, caring, and compassionate people who bring hope to people with chronic pain.  Dr. Batra shared solutions for my pain and let me know there were several things he could try to find relief for me.  My friends and coworkers have noticed a huge difference in me.  I can highly recommend this team because I know what they did for me!|The staff is wonderful and I never have to wait. The care and treatment are excellent. I got a 50% reduction of pain.

Epidurals every 5 weeks for chronic leg pain. Had a spinal cord stimulator implanted for chronic leg pain. No relief. Found out 3years later I had a blocked artery in my knee and had been getting the wrong treatment for years. Had 3stents put in my knee and now I'm much better. I assume this clinic heard of my surgery since I've had no contact with this clinic since my stent surgery. My blood flow to my leg was at 38% and I was told no one walks at 38%. I did it for over 3years. Now I get no calls from this clinic. Like I was never a patient there for years. Well I'm asking for a meeting with the hospital and Basalis boss. Let's see what happens. I bet I NEVER hear from this clinic or hospital without retaining council. Stay away from this assembly lline at Wooster pain management.|I called his office without an appointment and without any advance notice and they got me in that moment.  To say the least Dr B and his staff ALWAYS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. They've always treated my wife & I with the upmost respect. He even came in on his day off to take care of me and that isn't something that you'll find in the young Dr's  today. Now he's brought his son-in-law on board and he's got the best Dr to learn from the practice will definitely benefit from him on board. Thank you Dr B for all you do for me and my family.|The wait is the only bad thing here. The staff, nurses and Dr. Basali are great.|Dr Basalli is amazing. He is so kind and caring. I would not be walking without him. I had several issues with pain in my back, hip, knee, and neck. With his management, I can walk again. He has a gift to help people. Sometimes he runs behind because he does his job right. No short cuts  He really cares about his patients and their best interest is always top priority. I just trust him. He has never failed me yet.  Been with him about a year. My husband, daughter, and friends all go to him.  All positive experiences.|One of the most professional offices I have experienced.

How to Answer the Phone Tips
Answer all incoming phone calls before the third ring.
When you answer the phone, be warm, enthusiastic, and professional. Your voice on the phone is sometimes the only impression of your company a caller will get.
When answering the phone, welcome callers courteously and identify yourself and your organization immediately. Say, for instance, ""Good morning. Cypress Technologies. Susan speaking. How may I help you?"" Don't just say ""Hello"". No one should ever have to ask if they've reached such and such a business.
Enunciate clearly, keep your voice volume moderate, and speak slowly and clearly when answering the phone so your caller can understand you easily.
Control your language when answering the phone. Don't use slang or buzzwords. Instead of saying, ""OK"", or ""No problem"", for instance, say ""Certainly"", ""Very well"", or ""All right"". If you're a person who uses fillers when you speak, such as ""uh huh"", ""um"", or phrases such as ""like"" or ""you know"", train yourself carefully not to use these when you speak on the phone|The good: Excellent physician (Dr Patel), excellent staff. Very friendly, no judgement and, remarkably, I feel HEARD for the first time in my life about my chronic pain.  I've never had to wait and procedures as well as regular appointments are fast and efficient.
The not so good: Calling them with issues between appointments and trying to get a timely response is close to impossible.  I've waited a week or more to get a response to a phone message and sometimes didn't receive a return call at all and had to keep calling back. To their credit, they don't get exasperated, as if you're bugging them, but you kind of feel like you are, anyway, because you have to keep calling.  If they manage to improve in this area, then they'd easily be a 5-star office, in my opinion.

I still recommend them, though.  They really have been helping me get a handle on the chronic pain of fibromyalgia, among other issues.|I have been going to Dr. Bourne for 5 years now.  Dr. Bourne is excellent, he speaks to you in terms you can understand, he is extremely friendly.  Dr. Bourne listens intently and responds to my needs.

I've seen many doctors for over a decade about my back pain, and not only is he the first one to accurately diagnose the problem, but he's the first doctor not to jump to surgery or a one-size-fits-all solution. I know my particular issue might take some experimenting to figure out, but I'm confident that Dr. Verma has my back (literally and figuratively!) in finding a way to relieve my pain. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone!|Dr.Verma is awesome. He's very kind and doesn't judge you. He will listen t9o you he has compassion and cares for his patient.|Dr Verma has been a game changer in my quality of life. I was doubtful in PRP injections improving my cervical pain.  However, I am 4 weeks out from PRP and already back to exercise. I finally feel like myself again and I owe it to Dr Verma and his staff. Thank you for giving me my life back!!|Dr. Verma is extremely professional, knowledgeable and easy to work with. Scheduling was easy and the results of my procedure have been outstanding. I will definitely go back to him if and when I need to again. I strongly recommend Dr. Verma and his practice.|Great office and fantastic doctor. Easy to get in for an appointment. Dr. Verma explains everything in detail and gets right down to business in dealing with your pain. Cash prices are very reasonable if you can't wait for insurance to approve your procedure. I was out of pain within a week and a half after making my initial call to the office. They made the transfer easy from my old doctor's office to their facility. Could not have had a better experience. Highly recommend.|I saw Dr. Verma for PRP injections in January and again for 10 sessions of MLS therapy in Feb to help with chronic pain in my toe due to a running injury I sustained back in June '22 (torn ligaments). Although my toe is still not back to 100% I am very happy with the improvements and outcome so far.

The MLS therapy is quick and painless. My sessions were 7 minutes long, but they could be slightly longer or shorter depending on your injury. I noticed an improvement in my pain level after my very first session! Like magic. After several sessions the improvement leveled off for me but where I'm at now is much better than where I was! If you have an injury, especially a chronic one that has been bothering you for a while, I recommend trying this!

The jury is still out on whether my PRP injections will offer more improvement because they take a while to start working and then the healing process onward is slow. I will update my review in a couple months. There is a potential it won't help or improve my injury at all, although my PT said he has noticed that my toe has stiffened up - a very good sign in my case, as it was much too flexible/unstable due to the ligaments being torn! He says it's due to the PRP.

I do want to warn you that the injections are very painful, but keep in mind that the toe/foot is highly sensitive compared to other areas of the body. I received 3 injections in my toe (one right after the other) which were guided by ultrasound. Dr. Verma performed them while someone else held the ultrasound tool. The area was not numbed and I had no pain meds beforehand. The needle going in was painful, but the injection... the injection itself was excruciating and felt like liquid fire! Worst pain I've ever felt. I'm not trying to scare anyone away, but want you to be prepared. Bring a friend. Luckily I had a wonderful nurse at my side (I think her name was Karen) who coached me through the pain. Even though it hurt like a... I'm happy I had it done because it is better to try something rather than do nothing.

I'll end by saying that Dr. Verma is great! He is kind and shows compassion. The young lady at the front desk is awesome too!|Dr. Verma has taken care of both family members and friends of mine. The thoughtfulness and care he takes with each individual is unmatched. We will continue to seek his expertise and highly recommend him and is wonderful staff to anyone looking for a care pathway for pain intervention.|I saw Dr. Verma due to low back pain and sciatica that intially kept me from playing golf but worsened to impact my sleep and daily life. Dr. Verma ordered an MRI and based on that offered multiple treatment options with varying benefits and recovery time. I was able to opt for the plan that got me golfing again and still have alternative options going forward. I appreciate how Dr. Verma worked with me to choose the best individualized treatment.

I said ~ the nerve ablation gave me 7 months of relief.  So, I reported him to Quality Control--an outfit under Center for Medicare Services called Livanta. Livanta had trouble getting the records: that's because Dr. Smith and his crew were busy rewriting them. That's all Livanta does--records reviews-- so they gave the falsified records a pass. I have offered to take a polygraph test. Those injections did nothing for me other than cause me pain and bleeding at the injection site. Livanta has a terrible record with the BBB; I think it's creating a moral hazard.  Naturally, all the doctor has to do is falsify the records, and they are in the clear. I was going to report him to the State Medical Board, but my attorney advised to just get on with my life since I have a new doctor, and it would be time-consuming and distracting. All I would want to do is have the records expunged, and maybe have a menace doctor reprimanded for altering my chart in his favor. I wouldn't be surprised if he does it often. My MRIs show osteoarthritis and NOT sacroiliitis. The nurse that wrote it up was saying that even if I got a little relief, I would be a candidate for joint fusion--trying to sell another procedure, I presume.|Him and his team are caring and very professional.

I tore my meniscus again in 2023, had surgery again. This time 40% of my meniscus removed and I never recovered.

I suffered debilitating, chronic knee pain.

After trying 22 separate therapies such as painkillers, cortisone shots, gel injections, specialized shoe inserts, three rounds of physical therapy, laser therapy, TENS unit therapy, chiropractic manipulation, DMSO cream,  genicular nerve ablation, various medications etc., I elected to have a NALU brand peripheral nerve stimulator implanted into my thigh/knee.

I went to Elite Pain Doctors for this treatment and eventually had Dr. Sloop perform the surgery to implant the peripheral nerve stimulator.

The employees here were always kind and courteous. Dr. Sloop was extremely good about explaining everything in great detail and listening to my surgical comments/concerns.

I was concerned that this procedure would be painful due to the fact your ""awake"" for it and it's a somewhat involved procedure.

Dr. Sloop and his team made sure I had a nearly pain free surgery and all went very well.

I'm still recovering as of the writing of this review, but so far-so good.

I give credit to Dr. Sloop and his team for being professional and courteous. But above all, actually listening to the patient, which can be rare anymore.|I'd like to thank Elite Physical Medicine for making me part of their family in my health challenges. No I didn't need to have surgery on my Right hip, since it wasn't very bad shape. My hip doctor let me know that the left tip that was looking in very bad shape. In fact should hold up for quite some time. It appears the stem cell injections there may save me both surgery and a painful recovery.

The Epidural injections I received yesterday were very helpful, I was of coarse apprehensive. The entire harmless procedure was handled in a highly soothing and professional way.
This begins with a fun and prompt attention in the waiting area, I am always handled in a timely manner.
Then the nurses and attendants pre-gather data to improve their efficiency. These are the people that you want when you need help.
Next Dr Scheoder takes over, professional, empathetic and most capable best describes my interactions with her. She recommended that we try injections to lubricate and lessen the inflammation in the lumbar region of my spine.
Telling the truth I was uneasy with poking a needle in the spine but my concerns were unnecessary paranoia.

Dr. Katabay never even looked at my xrays or MRI. So I went ahead with the surgery it was the best decision I made. I still am a patient the only issue I have is i have never seen Dr. Katabay again in the last almost 4 yrs. I seen the Physicians Assistant every 3 months. If I need any changes she puts me on hold ( we have virtual appointments that i love) she goes back talks to Dr. Katabay then comes back and tells me what he says. Now the Physicians Assistant is really good but can I see my Dr.sometimes. Now if I agree to the injections I would see him. I do have to admit if a mistake was making on ur script that was sent in or the pharmacy is out of ur meds and u need to have another script sent someone else and the office is closed u call the emergency on call. The Dr. sends a new script within a couple hours. U don't go without ur medicine.|Dr Katabay is by far got the best bedside manner of anyl doctor I've ever encountered.

The staff was friendly, professional, and made me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in. The doctors and nurses were knowledgeable, attentive, and took the time to answer all my questions. The office was clean, well-organized, and the wait time was minimal. I truly appreciate the high level of care and would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for quality medical services|I was unfortunately referred to Dublin Pain Management by Ohio Health and the Riverside Community Medicine Program. Dublin Pain Management is without a doubt, Certainly, the single worst medical facility I have encountered in my lifetime. I have traveled and lived in third world countries for more than 60 years and have seen field hospitals established under challenging conditions whose standards, staff, cleanliness, and professionalism far exceeded this sad and ersatz excuse of a ""Pain Clinic"". The long list of atrocious shortcomings leaves one wondering exactly where to begin in describing the failures and abuses heaped upon any and all poor souls this ""clinic"" is supposed to serve. These unacceptable failures range from the mundane (dirty floors, broken and soiled furniture, inoperable trash containers, littered exterior, broken doors, unsanitary bathrooms often closed due to unperformed repairs) to life-threatening (sham physicals, misplaced records, prescription errors). Patients often wait hours for a 30-second physical examination.
The staff regularly insulted one another, swore, (the office manger yelled ""f___ you"" to another staff member) and seemed to last as employees only weeks. Staffers regularly complained about coworkers to patients when they would not be overheard. The entire staff less one individual was replaced at least once, some as many as four times in a little over one year. The Doctor who is in charge of the clinic I met exactly ZERO times during my treatment!
My case typifies the sad state of medical care, and pain management in particular, in our country, state, and community. These terrible circumstances into which patients are cast are mandated by lawyers at medical organizations such as Ohio Health, their subsidiary Riverside Hospital, and their clinic, Community Medicine. In the name of lessening their exposure to legal and medical complications they demand patients suffer indignancies and poor treatment rather than receive the treatment they deserve.
Run, yes run, run away as fast as you can from any referral directing you to Dublin Pain Management and any complicit organization such as Ohio Health and Riverside Hospital.
Caveat Emptor|I love this place!!! The staff is very helpful and accommodating every time I come in.   The ladies in the reception area are amazing and the sweetest.   Every appointment is always a pleasure they make the wait enjoyable  with humor and conversation.  Been going here for 4 years!!|I have fibromyalgia and mild osteoarthritis. At my appointment in December, Dr. Siddiqui claimed that the fibromyalgia was from my muscles locking up in response to the arthritis pain. I'm certainly not an expert, but that's not what fibromyalgia is based on the reading I have done and the other doctors I've spoken to.

He wanted to start me on opiates immediately and was dismissive of my worries about them. His plan was the opiates and twice-annual injections to kill my nerves. He didn't even plan to address the fibromyalgia beyond the above statement.

I have since found another provider who is addressing the arthritis AND the fibromyalgia without opiates or injections. I will not be back to Dublin Pain Clinic.|I really like Dr Minor. He listens to my concerns and works around my various hardware so I am able to tolerate injections easier.

He's  very capable at performing many procedures, but understands not everyone is capable of enduring all. He works with his patients and isn't rigid or unbending.

The office staff is very nice and accommodating.  With the size of the practice,  they even remember my name. I've had to call a few times for some complicated reasons and the appropriate staff was contacted and addressed the issues the same day.

His physician assistants and practitioners are great. They're on point, they listen and they care... even remembering issues that were discussed on previous visits.

This is not an office that just hands out opiates and the like just because you show up. They make sure the images,  physical and testing support a person's claims then acts accordingly with a combination of therapies. They gain information on your entire health history and apply the same to understanding the bigger picture and creating your treatment plan.

If you're there for the right reasons, you get the right care in my experience.|I was Leary about switching to a new pain Dr. I was born with rare birth defect ad have had a lot of surgeries. I'm so glad I did go to them. They understand about my medical issues. Give great recommendations. Explain things to me. So I understand why somethings work better than other things. They really care about my issues. Only problem I have, is getting a return call or reply to messages.|The doctor is the best, the office etiquette is wonderful! They care about their patients. Have been with them for years. There's no place else I would be interested in going. When you finally find the best, you should stick with it. I give Integrated Pain Solutions 5 stars ( )with no hesitation!|I was a little apprehensive when I first started going and that was basically because of the location. But as I continue to go I realize that the location wasn't as far away as I thought it was in the beginning.Office always very clean including the bathrooms I'm a stickler about a doctor's office bathroom. All of the staff that I have come in contact with are great and that definitely includes my physician Dr Akbick He is so personable and understanding, He doesn't treat you like a copay he treat you like a person. He is someone that really cares about his patient.So at that point the location didn't even matter. I had a procedure performed on my spine called a Nerve Ablation and I was really nervous about it because I thought it was going to hurt but in actuality it didn't and my back felt great for really good while but I guess with the nerve damage that I have that causes my back pain is something that I'm probably just going to have to live with. Anyway as far as the Practice is concerned I would recommend it to anyone that is struggling with back pain.|I always have great care with them.  Dr. Akbik is a fantastic caring doctor and always listens with care!  I wish they would not have a huge turnover of nurse practioners though.  Every month it seems one has left and a new one comes in.....but the receptionists are wonderful!|I have had no problems whatsoever with this office and staff.  Lobby is clean, staff is welcoming and out of the multiple Dr's and specialists i have to see chronically they have never had me wait more than 10 minutes.  I feel I'm in honest and good hands.|I have been with this practice for many years. From the doctor down to the secretary, I am treated with empathy and respect. Going to a pain management doctor was the last thing I wanted when it was first recommended for me. The first doctor I went to was only interested in inflating my bill. The second doctor seemed to have a ""different"" schedule for more important patients and I would sit for hours (literally) beyond my appointment time.  The third pain management doctor I saw was shut down by the government. I was so naive I had no clue anything was going on and still don't know if he was guilty of anything. Then I met Dr. Hammam Akbik. He, and his staff, are what everyone who needs pain management should be lucky enough to find.|Dr listens, and never rush you. Genuinely care and will reach out to your other doctors if they are concerned. Rarely are they running behind.  I recommend Dr Akbik and Iesha all the time. Several of my Doctors refer to them now.

I have chronic pain due to a motorcycle accident over a decade ago. Throughout my journey I've seen many physicians and tried many therapies. He didn't disregard any of my symptoms and listened to how I feel my other chronic diseases play a part in my chronic pain. I'm sure my appointment ran him late, but he allowed me the time anyway. That is a good doctor. A good one may run late because of giving to another patient.

I was very impressed to have him really look for himself at my actual MRI CD imagery. I felt validated he understood why I feel the way I do. He saw me as a whole person and put sincere thought into my situation. His willingness to learn and be up to date on current techniques is refreshing and appreciated. I can work with a doctor like him. I look forward to it.|Dr. Malinowski did an amazing job not only on my surgery but he's an all around amazing doctor. He cares about his patients takes the time to explains things in a way that won't make you feel stupid or silly for asking him. His staff is so helpful and they are amazing about getting back to you if you have any questions or concerns. I had a spine stimulator put in and the care and attention Dr. Malinowski and his staff gave was outstanding! Definitely highly recommend Dr. Malinowski and his staff.|I do not recommend Dr. Malinowski for several reasons.

During the appointment, I felt as if he was listening to me but not hearing what I was actually saying. I am not a typical pain management client as I'm easily 20 years younger than the average client and was seeking assistance to manage a new pain oriented diagnosis. A car ran out in front of me resulting in a car accident and now I have fibromyalgia.

He became exceptionally uncomfortable when I got upset/angry after he reviewed previous treatment suggestions post MRI, told me he couldn't change my medication because I have to try them for 3-6 months (which isn't true), and then asked me if I researched any methods of treating fibro. When I get upset/angry I begin crying. He asked if he said anything to result in me crying. Yes- I have a new chronic condition and was told that I have to try and ""deal with it"" for about 3-6 months when I'm barely functional. Of course I was angry/upset.

Then he proceeded to call my primary care doctor and left the office to finish the phone call. I felt like he was verifying if I was crazy- come to find out he didn't know what to do since I was upset/angry with him. Since he was on a phone call, he sent Tonya to check on me who was respectful and very kind. I declined talking to her because there was nothing else to say at that point. She said I was done with my appointment and could leave so I did.

Shortly after, I got a message on MyChart stating that he asked Tonya to talk to me while he spoke to my PCP. When he went back to the room to talk to me about their conversation, I had left. He knows that I was frustrated today and hopes I know their office is there for me and my PCP would be reaching back out to me.

To say the least, this was an awful experience. Who calls their PCP because their patient starts crying? Absolutely ridiculous....|My name is Heath. I've had neuropathy for seventeen years and about a year ago I seen an ad on Facebook about a spinal stimulator through nevro that would reduce neuropathy pain. I called nevro the next day and they made an appointment for me with Dr. Malinowski. During the consultation a representative from nevro came and explained what the stimulator could do.  After the pretesting. The trial stimulator was placed in my back. That night was the first night in years I slept all night without kicking my feet and keeping me awake. I was amazed how much better my feet felt. I did not want them to remove the stimulator because I knew I was going to be in pain again until it was put in permanently.  I cannot thank Dr. Malinowski and his staff, and the people with nevro for all of their hard work getting me approved for the procedure.

Sincerely,
Heath Pettry|Dr Mark Malinowski is an awesome doctor. He is very conscientious, friendly, engaging, and takes time to know his clients.

I went to him for a medical condition I was misdiagnosed with and he figured out what was really wrong and set me up with a treatment plan that started me feeling better in a short period of time.  I was in a lot of pain and he showed empathy and listened to me explain in detail why I was there to see him.  Afterwards, he walked me through my options and possible outcomes.  I highly recommend him if you are in pain and need relief.|Dr. Malinowski is an excellent physician.  He is not only skilled, he is caring and able to understand each unique situation and patient.  There is no ""cookie-cutter"" feel to his care.  He understands that even though different patients might have the same issues, their lives and what is important to them are very different.  He takes the time to understand each patient and each situation and works with them to provide a treatment plan that is specialized to their needs.  His caring is evident during every office visit and every intervention performed.  Although he is always busy, the patient does not feel rushed or like ""just another number"".  I have, and will continue to recommend Dr. Malinowski.  He is truly the best of the best.|I was referred to Dr Malinowski by another doctor, I so glad I went .

Unlike some I do not want to be dependent on a pill so I can get around . I have had two back surgeries so far. We tried the trail pain disruptive probes and had good results. I will be getting the permanent unit this week. I will be forever grateful if this works!! Not sure why people are giving him a bad review, to me he is a down to earth kinda guy and is straightforward with you . He puts you at ease when doing procedures, makes sure you are numb enough so it doesn't hurt too much and has a awesome staff that follows up with calls to make sure you are OK and walk you through any questions .|Have followed him to 4 locations. He is now in Lima. He is a wonderful doctor. Listens to everything you say. Sticks with you until he finds therapy that works, so long as he can help you. The first appointment, he makes sure that he is able to provide treatment for you and will be honest if he can't. This can rub people the wrong way, but stick with it because he is both a wonderful doctor and person. Has great bedside manner with his dry, sharp sense of humor and is so good ar putting you to ease, especially when you are first seeing him most likely you feel terrible. I started seeing him in 2008 and he is both my favorite doctor and has become my friend. Since my therapy right now is mostly seeing him for refills, he spends the time he has with me asking about my general life and health and offers opinions that he thinks may be beneficial. God Bless him for all he has done treating my Chiari Malformation.|I have been with Dr. Prok for 25 years and have only known of him being in 2 locations. I  wish he were still in Marion ,I'm not sure why he left but it takes 2 hours to get to Lima for me, but I go because I've known him so long and he is the only one who will do anything for me.|This doctor treated my aunt like she was some type of heroin addict trying to pass out drugs by the name of methadone & Suboxone which I've heard is a miracle of people with addiction and I'm all for that! However Her issue is pain & she was shocked. My aunt has been through so many surgeries, back surgeries etc...  and trauma throughout her life to the point she had a pain pump in her & wanted it out but wanted to trustworthy doctor so she gave this guy a chance!  He drug her through the mud week after week with something different!!!
I hope no one goes to this guy and understands that he has a short temper, he clearly is taking care of patients that have addiction problems which that's GREAT if so but when you're going there for pain these are not the type of drugs in my opinion you should be offering. I hope he seeks anger management classes!! I'm tired of my poor aunt calling me and crying because he's trying her on a multitude of different strong addiction recovery narcotics! If she doesn't like the medicine he gives her because it's always something different than he gets upset with her so she doesn't feel like she can even talk to him about things!!|For 15 years I was paying to be knocked out for my shots and ablations. Turns out I can't feel them hardly at all when awake! All that billing Saint Rita's got!  Furthermore, Dr. April didn't bruise my back to hell when he did my ablation. This dude rocks!|Why is this person getting good reviews. The man handed me a trifold pamphlet and charged me $65 and it was for something that isn't even safe and not necessary for me and my condition. Also never tried to figure out what I actually needed just gave me a piece of paper and charged me $65 for it. I mean Come On!!!! Get it together already dude.|In my opinion he is not a very good doctor he cares less about my pain after telling me he knows I'm a chronic pain patient. Dr Prok is a doctor who wants to control the patient not the pain|Just FYI, He no longer works in Marion.
HE IS NOW AT LIMA MEMORIAL, AND SEEMS SO MUCH HAPPIER!
He takes his time explaining, he knows my fear of needles and helps make it manageable, most down to Earth doctor I've ever met .
Anyone who has issues with him, apparently can't stand themselves, as this man will tell it to you straight! Watch the negative comments they may steer you away from one of the best doctors you'll ever see.
Oh and by the way, whichever one of you lied on the man, the truth will come out!!!!

One had their medical license suspended for pushing certain medicines for drug companies. Another pain Dr lost his license for selling drugs out of his trunk.

I found Dr. Lingam online after searching for a provider who gets great reviews for trigger point injections. I started seeing him spring/summer of 2019. My appointment times were always delayed; sometimes I would wait 3 hours.  I waited patiently because I was getting a few days of relief after the injections. Initially he listened to my concerns. One of the gals, Kelly, at the front desk was always rude which I expressed to Dr. Lingam. Once Covid hit they stopped office visits and trigger point injections which was understandable. My pain wasn't being managed which is what they are supposed to do, that is their whole thing. When I needed prior authorizations for my medication, it was like pulling teeth. The staff was rude to my pharmacist, who I have a good relationship with. For my first telehealth visit, I called on 4/13/2020 to confirm my visit which was confirmed for aweek later on Monday. On Monday was told Tuesday, then on Tuesday was told Wednesday, finally got a call on Thursday. I was out of medication and in pain which did not seem to matter to them. I attempted to find a new pain management doctor but was unsuccessful.  Back in 2017, I pursued getting a cervical neurostimulator placed which my insurance denied same day of surgery. I have been on/off of narcotics and always chasing doctors down to do prior authorizations and making appointments which has been consuming most of my time. After all this, I decided to wean myself off of narcotics yet again. I returned to the neurosurgeon and we are trying again to get the neurostimulator placed. I am also on a wait list for a neurologist that specializes in my type of pain. To be continued...|I have been a patient of Rau Lingam for many years and he's a fabulous doctor!

Courtney and Logan are absolutely phenomenal nurses. Their office is very quick about returning phone calls and scheduling appointments. I highly recommend his office! Absolutely amazing people! I really want to thank Dr. Prayson and his staff.|Dr. Prayson LISTENS and really cares about his patients.  If one thing doesn't work, he will try something else that does!!!

She is a an asset to the office!|My experience with Dr. Prayson have been excellent. He is a very caring, knowledgeable, kind professional Dr.   He actually takes time to talk to you and explain things to you in a manner that is understandable. I am blessed to have found him. Logan is an amazing assistant as well. He also takes time to listen and explain things in a way that I can understand.  He is an asset to Dr. Prayson.
I have been treated well by all the staff and the office and I look forward to working with them on a continued basis.|I have high praises and highly recommend Dr. Prayson! I was referred to him by Dr. Newton after finding that injections might help me rather than doing surgery.
I got in to see him rather quickly as he was seeing new patients. Our initial appointment went well as he described how the injections will help with the bulging disc in my lower back. He was very thorough in explaining everything to me.
Dr. Prayson scheduled me to come in a few weeks later for my injections. He explained everything that was going to happen before the 20 minute procedure and then reiterated it throughout. He came to check on me as I recovered after and said everything looked good.
I went for a follow up about 3 weeks following the procedure and they had worked wonderful for me!
He seems to be very involved in all aspects of the patient, which I find helped.
Dr. Prayson has a fantastic bedside manner and I would absolutely 100% recommend him to anyone looking into pain management. He knows what he's doing!|I had spent months in so much pain that I was living on OTC painkillers every 2 hours.  I could not mount on my horses and had trouble walk up and down stairs.  Once I was disgnoaed with femoral nerve impingement, Dr. Prayson was able to do an injection on it.  As soon as he started the injection, the pain went away.  It is post injection and I still feel wonderful.  Dr. Prayson also has a wonderful bedside manner.  He takes time to make sure he explains everything so you understand it and takes time to answer your questions.  I never feel like I am a number or money with him, I feel like a valued patient.|My husband went to Pain Mgmt and seen Dr. Prayson who prescribed Physical Therapy first for hip pain associated with his back pain.

He was able to get me in quickly (knowing I was in horrible pain) and within two weeks of my initial call he completed my lumbar injection. I feel 100% better. He has a great beside manner and really listens to his patients.|I was living with neck pain for a long time before going to the pain management clinic. During the first appointment with Dr. Prayson, he knew precisely what vertebra area was causing pain, and was very thorough in the assessment. Dr. Prayson talked me through every step of the procedure, and described what all the  technical jargon meant on a level that I could understand. He even assisted the nurse as much as he could during my injection procedure. He is also very empathetic and personable. I am so relieved to not feel pain and have movement in my neck again.

He's 23 and since a young age has had bulging disks, DDD, his knee keeps swelling up, arms and legs go numb or tingle. He can't sleep. It's affecting his whole life. Every Dr passes him to the next and no one does anything for him. It's frustrating. They all just want to give him anti depressants! I see everyone on here talking about the meds they prescribed. They told him they will not prescribe meds at all when they called to schedule him. Which is fine, he doesn't want anti depressants nor pain meds. He wants someone to HELP him. To figure out why this is happening and what we can do. He wants someone to listen, not pass him off because he's young. He does stretches, been to physical therapy, goes to a chiropractor. I just want someone to care enough to figure this out. He's had past testing, hence the few diagnoses. But that's been since he was 15ish. They don't do any testing to see progress of the issues. If anyone out there knows where I can take him, or anything that will help that we haven't done or thought of, please let me know. I don't want to lose my son because these Drs let him fall through the cracks.  Believe me, they didn't care either! So this place just evaluated him, told him to stretch, and is telling the referring physician to put him on anti depressants. He's told them them all those don't work, they make his depression worse.

I felt relief before I even left the table. No drugs, which I did not want. I Highly recommend Dr. Abraham.|Dr Abraham is fantastic, as well as her staff.  Listened to my concerns and did everything they could do address my back pain and make timely appointments.  I would highly recommend her and the pain management staff.|What an amazing experience.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  Dr. Abraham listened to my problem and then showed me where my difficulty was located.  I was scheduled for an injection and luckily they had a cancellation and I was able to get it the next day. I am scheduled for follow up in 6 weeks.|The staff was very nice . But the Dr. doesn't seem to care as much about taking on new pt. She wasn't listening. I was referred to her because I moved and couldn't continue traveling over an hour to see my prior pain specialist. I wanted to be in the Kettering Network because all my other doctors and care received at Kettering were amazing.
She insisted that i continue to go to my old doctor didn't want to listen to facts! Being out of my insurance network was costing a small fortune. They requested MRI and x- rays I expected her to say she would schedule for my back after review of the MRI but she kept insisting she probably wouldn't take care of my back even after review of the MRI. Wow
I felt stereo typed and wouldn't let her touch my back after this meeting for my knee pain. Because of her attitude. Not a caring Dr. at all.|Updated review.

Dr. Nirmala Abraham and her staff at Sycamore Pain Management are absolutely  Awesome! The 4th injection in her series of treatment had me feeling fantastic, So much so that I had forgotten that I still need to be careful how I lift things. Several weeks ago while lifting a snowblower in an awkward and completely wrong body position I felt a pop. The next day I had some mild pain, took some ibuprofen and ignored it. 2 weeks later the pain grew even worse, still hoping ice packs and Ibuprofen were not doing much to help, but I still hoped it would go away. Two days later I was in so much pain I went to the E.R. at 4am, they gave me 2 shots in my butt which did nothing. I called Dr. Abraham office in terrible pain and desperate for help. This is where the ""amazing"" part starts. They immediately scheduled me for injections for the following day. Unfortunately my insurance company requires pre-approval, which usually takes a week to get. In the meantime they got me into the office examine me and applied a large patch to help dull the pain. Some how her awesome medical staff was able to get pre-approval in 24 hours and scheduled me for the procedure in 36 hours. Dr. Abraham and her awesome staff truly do care. Not only are they truly sympathetic to a patients misery, their actions are proof this team of healers are driven by empathy. If you read anything other than positive comments about Sycamore Pain Management, it's total bunk!

Original review:
Dr. Abraham is Fantastic. I just completed my 4th treatment and I feel GREAT!
The injection on my first treatment was something else. She was right on the money with her accuracy. I won't lie; it hurt like hell, but only for about 8 seconds and very quickly dissipated. I had almost immediate relief although there was an odd, hard to describe mild discomfort for a few hours. I think it's just from a having a needle penetrate that deep, it too goes away in a few hours.

The first injection removed 90% of main nerve pain. I have not had any reoccurrence of the pain shooting from my back to my toe since. Each subsequent treatment was easier and with much less brief pain from the previous. My latest shot (4th), I felt hardly a tingle which tells me she has relieved me of nearly all my pain. Yes, nearly all. I would stay I am 97% pain free and love the results. I honestly expected maybe slight relief, how wrong was I.

Dr. Abraham is a legit Pain Management doctor, NOT one of those bull$hit Pill mill places. If you're just looking for drugs and pain killers, like some of the other pissed off reviewers here, don't waste your time she's a REAL doctor with effect treatments,  NOT a drug dealer with a license.

My stenosis is manageable and rarely interferes with daily activities. I am grateful!
He listens, welcomes questions, and remembers who I am, not just where I ache. (He always asks what I'm reading and really wants to know.)

Dr Drummond and his staff are the greatest, they always greet you with a smile , they just make your day.

Dr Drummond is great very very thorough, he draws out exactly what the problem is and explains how to help it.  The day of your procedure the nurses whom you already know from the office come in and check everything out and get you ready Then Dr Drummond comes in and explains the procedure again and marks the area. They all are excellent. I was always afraid of having injections in my back. But with Dr Drummond I felt so comfortable and was not afraid at all. I highly recommend it and it will definitely help your problem.  Thank y'all for everything K.Cramer|I have seen other pain management doctors and I believe he is one of the best. He takes his time explaining things with different options. I had a spinal cord implant which works great. The only drawback is needing to charge the battery every day.

Not a lot of great reviews out there on this doctor. However, folks who are unhappy not getting a medicine they think they should have tend to be pretty critical when it doesn't go their way. That said, I actually liked him. He took time to listen and explain issues. I didn't think he was condescending and didn't try to pressure me into anything.

She and her staff have been very kind and professional each time I have been there. She performed a Nerve Ablation on my neck and the difference in the pain was incredible! First time in years I had relief.
I told her I don't like taking any prescription pain meds and unlike others she didn't try to push them on me.
The procedure I had done in the cervical area done can be very dangerous and I have absolute trust in her.
Eric C.|Seeing the comments I thought I was the only one. I Saw this Doctor 7 years ago I am a Minority Race. On the first visit this doctor said she does not give meds well she said that on the second visit as well but prescribed me Tramadol. She had no problem giving me injections when it came to it but
I asked if she could change my meds to something different she asked ""what works"". I asked what she recommended she said ""she's not going change my medicine for me to take what she gives me"". I told her the medicine makes my stomach hurts. The doctor than unprofessionally throws my chart to the floor and storms out of the door. If you are Minority find another doctor. She should not be a doctor.|Dr Aminian and staff are friendly, courteous and knowledgeable.  I was greeted by the front desk and waited a few mins then checked me in.  Nurse Victoria is awesome.  Took the time to know all the details and set expectations. Dr Aminian then came in to see me and explained everything in detail.  Wasnt being rushed or anything.  Very friendly too.  Finally Nurse Brenda checked us out and gave final details for scheduling my Sacroiliac joint injection on Wed Jan 11th.  Will update the review once shot and follow up is done!  Looking fwd to it!

Update 4/18/2023
Dr Aminian and staff are great every step of the way!|My mother has been seen by Dr. Aminian for a number of years for managing her pain from disability and neuropathy. Over the last year, after a number of significant life changes, mom is now in a retirement community where she no longer has to exert herself more strenuously, and is able to ""take it easy"" for a majority of her days. As a result, she hasn't needed to take as much of her pain medication aside from a low daily dose for maintenance to take the edge off her pain so she can sleep at night. Dr. Aminian wrote her prescription for 1-2x 1/2 pills AS NEEDED, then when she has only been generally taking a half pill per day, her three month script is able to last her nearly 6 months. At her last appointment, mom told them she was taking it daily, but then she was accused of lying about what she was doing with the medication because she didn't pick up a script in March when she wrote it... because she wasn't out yet and didn't need it. So instead of adjusting how much was being prescribed, listening to us about the change in her lifestyle, she just referred to mom as a ""safety concern"" in an overly accusatory tone and flat out refused to do anything further for her; told us we would need to pursue care elsewhere if we wanted her to continue on her maintenance level of the medication that she has been on for over 20 years.

But let's not address the issue that you're the one who is actually -= OVER PRESCRIBING THE OPIOIDS =-  but you want to get upset that you wrote the prescription and we didn't pick it up, because mom still has enough to maintain and it wasn't yet needed. Isn't the goal to have LESS of the opioids being out there? In fact, if we picked up 4x ""3 month scripts"" over a year of 90 pills, for 1-2x 1/2 pills as needed, this script would last between 3 and 6 months. If she only took a 1/2 pill for 6 months, we'd now have 180 pills, enough for her to maintain for an entire year... during which we would accumulate another unnecessary 360 pills.

Dr. Aminian didn't care to listen, showed zero concern for explanation of the change in lifestyle, displayed zero empathy for a person who has lived over a third of her life with chronic pain. All she appeared to be concerned about was how us not filling a unnecessary prescription made her (presumably) look like she was writing unnecessary pain medications. What's worse is the mental anguish she placed on our mother by making her feel like she did something wrong for trying to be responsible for how she took and maintained her pain medications.

Forget 1 star, 0 stars.
If you're looking for assistance with pain management, I would advise you to steer very clear of Dr. Aminian whose practice with her patients is a very real safety concern.|Dr. Aminian took the time to review my chart and discuss my options going forward. I would definitely, recommend her in the future. All of the staff from front desk, review staff, rn, and doctor were all very pleasant and helpful.
Thank you again,

She yelled at me for wanting my contract back I would not recommend her she made me uncomfortable and could not look at me.|Dr Aminian was rude, dismissive, and did not want to include me in my treatment. She already had her mind made up, and she was condescending when I tried to express my concerns. I was not drug seeking, however I was definitely treated like it. I am extremely disappointed with the level of care. Perhaps she should consider the patient's overall welfare before judging them.|She gives my boyfriend of 6 years, (Jack Higgins Jr). pills that he snorts, and then hes abusive and falls asleep sitting up slobbering.

They had him on a regiment that was working and keeping his pain away, then they started not scheduling within time frame and he was going a day or two sometime without his medication being refilled.  Started to treat him as an addict.   He called them out on their mistakes several times, was treated as a hostile patient.  They changed up his medication without providing clear justification on why.  Got a letter that they discontinued his treatment and that he will have to find another physician.  I am sad that now my spouse is now going through major pain again until the new physician can find a better treatment option.  He's never abused the system never tested positive and has always been on time.   But when you have someone living with chronic pain 27/7 you can't fathom the burden they carry.  This is a disgrace of this practice!|Rude office staff, esp office manager. I never saw the physician who writes my pain med orders. Poor communication, poor eye contact  with a demeaning approach from the team. Uses pain med prescription as a weapon of power over patients. Absolutely Would not recommend.|Would not recommend to anyone. The office staff are very nice and helpful. My husband and I have been there for 3 years. We have had numerous issues.  I couldn't tell you what Dr Kelly looks like we only saw him once when we started there. Last month we saw Dr Holman who is the dr on our prescriptions. We saw her because our PA we normally see was on vacation.  Wait time can be extremely long to get back to see you PA. We never get our prescriptions on the day we go. It usually takes at least 1 day usually longer.  You can not speak with anyone one the phone. You have to use email which can take up to 2 days for a response. Would not recommend to anyone. Doesn't rate 1star.|The entire staff is great! You're greeted with bright smiles when you check in. The front desk ladies are awesome! PA Stacey was a Godsend and I was so sad to see her go. PA Jennifer has been amazing. So personable and caring. I don't know where I'd be without their support.|I just want to thank Mikala and Dr. Kelly for giving my cortisone injection yesterday! He is so gentle and caring which I appreciate so much; this morning I woke up with no pain and don't need my walker at all! Thank you soooo very much!|I had horrible pain in my lower back. Went to several different providers who all seemed to think i was a pill seeker. I just didnt want to be in pain any longer. I wanted to be able to live life, work, be a good wife and grandmother . I saw Dr Kelly and we started treatment. I have had ups and down with pain however for the most part. We have been able to keep pain at tolerable range.  The staff is amazing. Front desk are always pleasant and professional. My nurseTeresa and the PA  Courtney, take great care of me.
If you are in pain, I would highly recommend Oklahoma Pain Management|It used to be a very stellar place. Drs. were so empathetic and so helpful. They no longer get it. I asked to be taken off a medication that was causing me to pass out on the job and they refused. I would think and Dr would be very concerned! Instead my Dr argued with me and refused to change it to something that didnt have this side affect. Also it took my Dr here 3 yrs to notice multiple fractures on my lumbar spine.|Since I made the original review a year ago I thought I would update. I'm very disappointed. I decided to leave when I had so much trouble getting out to the clinic and it seemed no one there understood that. I had to reschedule a visit because my ride didn't show up. This was always very stressful. The clinic has a text set up where the doctor or nurse can reply to calls through text. Everyone knows you shouldn't discuss anything important over text. I told the nurse that I had to reschedule again and this was on a Wednesday and my appointment wasn't until Monday. She stated ""oh you'll be just fine"" when I told her I would run out of medication by Friday evening. I decided then that if I were going to run short even though I would be 30 days out on Friday, that I would detox from the opioid medication and be done with it. My last visit was with Dr. Kelly for an injection. It really helped! I was eager to see if they would continue to help me but after dealing with the nurse I was completely done with the clinic. It's a shame really because for the most part it was helpful. I just had a problem with sooner ride getting me there.

I absolutely love my doctors. My overall health is always important to them. I feel free to discuss anything at all with them. Dr. Jennifer is always friendly, supportive and ask about my whole family. I'm never over medicated.

Thank you for your excellent care/service.|Very efficient, was impressed with the continuity of care from the nurse Alex even though she had never seen me before because she was just filling in for low staff. She usually works at the Broken Arrow office not the Muskogee one. She was caring respectful asked about past as well as future goals  no sign that she was in a hurry with the low staff situation but yet was like I said efficient. She explored several options she thought might be helpful for me and I felt prepared my current situation well for the nurse provider. The nurse practitioner was also very efficient and with the nurses notes and a few confirmation questions and answers from me was very thorough. No complaints would recommend a friend to see these providers|I've been very pleased with the care from Access. The doctors are thorough, compassionate and take the time to answer all questions and explain things.

My husband is a disabled vet who has struggled to get a doctor to listen to him about his pain and the impact on his quality of life. Dr. Robinson has been so understanding and provided real treatment and actual solutions. We will be forever grateful to Dr. Robinson and his staff.|I enjoyed seeing Dr. Robinson. I thought the front office staff was very nice, all the nurses were very pleasant as well. The wait time was long but that's the only negative I have. Overall it was a good experience|I love Dr. Robinson he is so respectful and treats you right he finds the solution to help your pain. I also see Dustin and he is awesome too it's never a dull visit with him and he takes care of you as well. The staff and nurses everyone in the office are awesome and very professional. I have been with this clinic for a few years and don't plan to go anywhere else...|Dr. Robinson office has the best staff. They always have my paperwork up to date and they help me  with all of my questions. You get in to see the doctor really quick. I have never had any problems with this office. The staff is so nice, respectful and so knowledgeable in there field. I would recommend and have recommend Dr. Robinson to family and friends.|I have been a patient of Dr. Darryl Robinson for over 15 years and I would recommend him to everyone needing professional care. He has made me feel safe and secure in all phases of my care. I am very happy he placed Dustin his PA to handle my needs also.  I would like also thank my primary care physician for turning me over to Dr. Robinson for my care.|I've been going to Dr. Robinson for over 10 years to manage severe lower back pain, sciatic pain, and arthritis in my hips. I usually see his PA for my appointments. During this time I have received multiple epidural injections along with other treatments and daily meditation. Some of the reasons i keep seeing Dr. Robinson and his staff is that, he respects my decision of not wanting surgery, the treatments he performs, he does so with a mild sedative to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible. Ive heard so many horror stories about other pain management Doctors not using pain relief during procedures. I can't imagine having to suffer through a procedure that is supposed to bring relief. It doesn't make sense to me.
Lately I've have been fortunate enough to be seeing his PA Dustin Brooks. I can't say enough good things about this guy. He really cares about the pain your in and recommends the best treatments to bring relief. Out of the last 3 PA's Dr. Johnson has had, I have to say that Dustin is the best! Presently he suggested a procedure that hasn't been done before. Now all of the treatments have brought some form of relief. Having said that , the last one, was a life changer. If you live in constant pain, then you know what I'm talking about. For the last few years I've been worried about possibly having to start using a wheelchair. But after the last treatment, I no longer worry about it. I can move and walk better than ever! He brought a level of pain relief I've never experienced before. He was able to pin point where the pain was originating from, and recommend the appropriate treatment. For the last two months I have been able to manage the pain with just the daily medication. It feels like a miracle. I haven't felt this good in the last 10 years! I feel like I owe him a debt of gratitude. I've even given up my cane!
My name is Jerry McKnight. If anyone wants to talk to me about a referral, or what to expect, please reach out. I know how hard it is to live in severe daily pain. It's not hopeless. There is help out there. As far as I'm concerned, this is the place to start. In all honesty, I wouldn't see anyone else. Dr Robinson and his staff are the best!
May you find relief and peace.|I have had nothing but a great experience at Dr. Robinson's office.  PA Dustin as well as Dr. Robinson himself have went above and beyond to find the right treatment to alleviate my chronic pain and get straight to the source of it. Dr. Robinson , PA Dustin and the rest of the staff are all very patient, kind, friendly and always greet me with a smile and a warm welcome.  Very grateful for them all!|You will have to wait a very long time in his office to see him. Appointment time means nothing to him. This has happened every visit. I asked why it was running so late and was told ""He doesn't show up everyday until around 9:45."" I asked why there are 8:00 appointments then and was told- he is SUPPOSED to be here by then, but isn't.
He also had a horrible bedside manner! Refused to listen to anything I said about how my back was. My husband finally chimed in and said ""did you look at her chart, at all?""

After receiving an injection, I was left to walk out on my own and nearly fell, with the front desk staff being the only ones to assist, as the nurse had no time to help.

Additionally, I had planned for an injection based on the quoted price of $95. I took time off work, rearranged my family schedule, only to find out the day before that the actual cost was $390. I submitted a respectful complaint, expecting to be heard and treated with respect. However, instead of addressing the issue, the office canceled all of my upcoming appointments without informing me.

I came in today for an appointment expecting my $40 copay and was hit with $130 which I didn't have and told the dr refused to see me without payment in full. I only saw the dr once and he never even introduced himself, just came in did my injection and was done. I actually didn't even see him. Just heard his voice.

Talks to me the whole time and let's me know when there might be a pinch or a sting and I sure appreciate that because if you are prepared for for the sting it's so much - no surprises and he tells me all the steps. So, he involves his patients in their care.  He is super good with his injections and it's over in a flash.

He is very thorough with his assessments and has done more for me in the last few months than at least 10 other doctors have (not including ERs and urgent cares).

The only complaint I has, if it's even that. It he fills up quickly, so there tends to be a waiting period in his office.
But it's something that's easily disregarded when you're actually being helped.|Dr Wasif is an amazing doctor Who listens and truly cares about his patients.  I've been a patient of his for almost 9 years and I truly would not be able to live a pain-free life without him.|Update: Back in July of 2021 I started having increased pain in both my back and head. I also have a medtronic spinal cord stimulater in both my back and head. Anyway after many months of feeling like Dr.Wasif and his staff was listening but not hearing what I'm actually saying. Dr.Wasif saw me one last time in December told me he thought I should check myself into Laureate to get some ""rest"". When I told him no and thought I thought it was messed up that he was wanting me to do that because he couldn't figure out what's going was going on with me. I left the room and my fiance stayed. Dr.Wasif told my fiance that he was dismissing me as his patient he would send me a certified letter in the mail and if I wanted him to he would take out my back stimulater but that's all he would do for me now. Then a week later I got a call from his office saying we misunderstood him he just wants me to go to another doctor to try to help me. After that though I ran out of medication before i could get into to see another pain specialists and Dr. Wasif would not give me any refills. It was a disheartening ending. I remember when I first started seeing him I was crying and I said I need to know you believe me that I'm telling the truth I am in pain. He grabbed my hands looked me in my eyes and said I believe you that meant so much. Turns out the leads in my back stimulater had moved my medtronic representative informed me that Dr.Wasif knew this when he wanted me to commit myself to the mental hospital. I still don't know exactly why he did that or what was going on. Dr.Wasif never talked to me just his staff would. So if by chance you see this Dr.Wasif I followed you from where you last worked. You actually told me when I called you and came to my first appointment at your new office that I was actually was your very first patient there ever. How could you throw away one of your loyal patients for no reason I can see and leave me in horrible pain with no resources even to get help.

Dr.Wasif is one of the best doctors I've had treat me in a long time. He is though and always seems to have my best interest in mind. He also seems to be caring and sympathetic to what im going through which means alot to me because not all doctors I've had in the past have been. He generally seems to help me get better which is ultimately what I want too.|I am always looking at reviews when I get referred, well I researched my own pain doc opting out of the one I was originally referred to. The reviews led me to Dr. Wasif. I recommend him and his staff to anyone and everyone. He is such a great Dr. He listens and is very informative. If you are looking look no further, he's right here.|Dr. Wasif and his staff Amanda, Michelle, and all the ladies are truly amazing!!! Dr. Wasif is truly gifted, compassionate, and highly skilled his knowledge,and education is a WOW FACTOR!! He takes all the time you need, he educates his patients, and takes full and truly amazing care of his patients. I have travelled from Tennessee and Florida to see Dr. Wasif. I have never had a pain management doctor who is this talented and gifted and has an amazing bedside manner. He has done everything for me gone above and beyond when all other doctors don't give the time or care to do so. His staff stay on top of everything Amanda is so amazing if your having a bad or painful day just talking to her sure makes you feel better!!! I am extremely thankful that I am under his care!!! I've had injections, and surgery from Dr. Wasif and was the second person in the state to get the newest technology in having my spinal cord stimulator replaced thanks to Dr. Wasif and Abbott Labs.  Thank you Dr. Wasif, Amanda and all the staff for the best, most amazing and compassionate care you all truly touch people's lives and do your best to make it better!!!!|Dr .Wasif ,Michelle, Laura ,drew ,are excellent. Dr .wasif has Patiences & understanding and listens to his patiences. I recommend,Dr wasif to everyone.Thankyou very much for the differents  you have made in my life and alot of my life back without  as much as pain.5*****|I've been seeing Dr. Wassif for about 3 years. I've been to other doctors that deal with chronic incurable medical conditions. But no doctor has ever been so kind, considerate and professionally managed my condition. Dr. Wassif is extremely concerned about the welfare of the patients. He is a highly educated and trained but still shows his sincere compassion and desire to help.
Also, the staff is incredible!!! The ladies that work for the doctor are so kind and caring. It is my opinion this the way a doctor and doctors office should operate. Thank you!|I was very happy with Dr Wasif & his staff initially. He was very professional and the steroid injections were helping. However, it was quite costly as he puts you under anesthesia in his office for the procedure.
I was a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator so we were working toward that.
I was also having severe hip pains from a wreck I was in and he suggested we do a steroid injection there, as well. This was in Nov. Being tapped out monetarily, we agreed to wait until after the first of the year to do the procedure. In the first part of January I'm notified I have an appointment for my procedure which I didn't schedule and I couldn't yet afford. I asked them to not schedule for me like that anymore as that was the SECOND time and unprofessional. In February I called and, of course, they never answer their phone to make an appointment for the procedure and was told I needed to see him again to DISCUSS it. Discuss what? I said we had already discussed it and I just needed to know what I would be billed and want to have the procedure done. You have to pay at time of service, mind you. They never called back. He wanted TWO visits! Also, the time before, the IV cap came off and I started bleeding everywhere on their floor unknowingly and he was irritated with ME. The girls are nice but I don't know what happened with him! GREED and OVERBOOKING maybe? My other PM doctors of 5 years referred him to me so I'll let them know how he treats his patients.",2024-12-23|2024-06-13|2017-07-13|2023-09-25|2022-11-15|2024-06-03|2022-01-23|2023-03-26,4|5|1|5|5|5|5|1,,,"10 a.m.|2 p.m.|3 p.m.",54.4|54.2|53.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What was the medication that was injected into my right hip on my last visit...what was it supposed to accomplish.....could I possibly forego this completely.","Please call 918-986-7533 option 1 during business hours.

This causes intense pain 24/7 . This facility didn't once come close to relieving my pain . They are so afraid to give you a dosage that will actually help that unless your pain is very mild they are useless . Every time I went a asked for something better and got refused .

You will not find better care in Oklahoma|This place is horrible and only cares about the money not the patient. The first thing they will greet you with do you have your co pay before even saying hi! The nurse is rude, loud and disrespectful. Expects respect and in her words you should know her level by what's written on her scrubs. She talks down to people who are there for help not knowing anything about them. She assume she better educated then the patients. Hard to fine dump of a place for abusive services. Do not waste your time with this place. There are other clinics who care about the patient who talk and understand the cause of the pain. I was not a patient I was there because of the elderly woman I was helping and felt bad and was yelled at for asking the nurse simple questions. She yelled at us and would not let anyone talk. She was so loud you could hear her outside the office.|OMG! This place is a joke. And not a funny one either. My Son had been hurting so bad. He's 35. Took 3 months to see this doc and he did nothing. I mean nothing. Wants him to come back in 4 weeks.Run away very fast. I am in such disbelief they did nothing no steroids. No muscle relaxer.

I will always recommend this place to anyone needing pain management.|I can't say enough kind things about this wonderful place. I am still what I would consider a new patient, and we are still working through my best options, but I have never felt more listened to by a team of medical staff than I have at Fraley.

Their bedside manner is unmatched, their compassion radiates from them, and they are just downright SO FUN, even in situations that are less than ideal (spinal injections).

While my pain is not completely gone, Dr. Fraley takes the time to discuss options, next steps and pours over my issues with the greatest detail. She takes notes when I am talking and never once have I felt rushed through my appointment or pushed in to a treatment. I am so thankful I was referred to her and her clinic because they really go above and beyond compared to some other pain management places I have been.

They take all the time I need to make sure all my questions are answered. Dr. Fraley is extremely kind and is happy to share her knowledge. She also has a lovely sense of humor that helped put me right at ease during my first injection. Kudos to the Fraley Clinic.

I was in a car wreck mid October and EVERY appointment there was multiple problems with my pain medication prescription and even after multiple calls trying to get the problem fixed THERE was still more on their end. Then my last appointment I said I would just need my last two weeks from that first month prescription to just be sent in and they sent in over 100 pills when my last two weeks prescription would have only been about 48. After that I just gave up. This has been every appointment to the point where there was a problem with me getting the medication I needed. I just give up and would rather be in serious pain and just be walking on my broken pelvis and ankle with the help of medication my primary care can give or Tylenol.

I was frist with Samantha the MA and she was so nice. I felt immediately comfortable.  She then went and got Dr Brewer. We had honest, real conversations about my issues which are a lot! I felt super comfortable, seen, heard and genuinely feel like they want to help me. That's been a huge struggle for me to find. Seriously come here! This is coming from someone who's lived in pain for more than half of my life!|I had high hopes for this office however, I was under the impression that I was being seen for the pain that is associated with the autoimmune disease that I have. I developed myopathy due to the fact that my primary care physician has changed my medication more than once (I'm guessing or it could actually be the autoimmune disease) however, I was told that I'm being treated for the myopathy pain, which was diagnosed AFTER the referral to this office? So the ACTUAL cause of my pain was kind of dismissed (in my opinion) I was hospitalized for 4 days because I couldn't walk.... I was given high doses of steroids, high doses of pain medication, muscle relaxers, blood thinners, potassium, high blood pressure medication and a few others. I was sent home with the necessary medication that I would need. At my follow up appointment, I was given pain medication to help me with the pain and inflammation until I was seen in the office today, at my appointment, the doctor read some of the diagnosis, took my medication from 6 times per day down to 4 times per day, I also asked if he could send the same medication that my primary prescribed because it actually worked more than any, he said that he would. He didn't, he wrote the medication that is mixed with acetaminophen which is causing me to have liver problems. Not to mention the fact that I showed the doctor in my chart along with telling him that the previous prescription would be completed today, he wrote that I couldn't get my refill until next week. I couldn't get anyone on the phone so I had to drive 20 minutes back to the office to NO AVAIL.  I have a very low risk of opioid addiction however after being on opioids for weeks, I have a very high chance of having opioid withdrawal because everything I said went in one ear and out the other. Now I don't have a prescription that can be filled until next week on Tuesday,  I'm in pain. I'm very frustrated, I wish I could find a pain management doctor who knows about my autoimmune disease that will take my health care in consideration, where I will feel heard and understood. I'm going to do another review to update this process and what I'm going through. I pray this helps someone in the decision making process. If you're under 45 and not on life support or cancer, take your time to have a consultation first, I promise everytime I go to the doctor, it's like I'm being set back.|I have been a patient here for almost a year. I have an auto immune issue called MCAS and that causes broad and wide spread chronic pain from my immune system causing massive inflammation. I was treated very well at my first appointment and then was made to see the lower level practitioners because I'm only permitted to see a Dr. Henderson once a year. I had zero issues with pain medication refills until I came down with COVID in August. I had to cancel my appointment last minute so that I did not come in with active COVID infection. Since then I have been treated abhorrently by Amber and Randy. I am not longer called back and I'm no longer able to have my medications refilled on time. I have tried multiple times to have this issue resolved and have only been treated worse with every attempt I make. I would strongly suggest you go to a pain clinic where the staff members actually practice compassion and empathy. Amber the office manager is anything but compassionate and kind. I have requested a call back from my physician or his assistant which was promised, only to be called back by Amber when I did not want to speak with her further. She quoted policy regarding prescription fill's. Advised me that only a Doctor can write refills on my medication. I have spoken to my Pharmacist and confirmed that is NOT the case. He also stated that this office "" has many complaint issues"". Please consider another office when seeking compassionate care from the ENTIRE staff. Being a chronically ill patient is hard enough. Being treated like you are not a human being is completely uncalled for and just morally wrong.",2025-01-02|2025-01-06|2024-10-28|2024-12-12|2025-02-11|2024-09-08|2024-12-13|2024-11-01,5|3|5|1|5|5|2|1,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|2 p.m.",68.4|65.6|62.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Will this clinic see you if you have (and utilize) an Oklahoma Medical Marijuana card?",Yes,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJjyl_rJCLtocR_PH2eshvE90,105

STEPHENS & DR. PHILLIPS TO ALL MY PEOPLE & FRIENDS. BOTH ARE REALLY TERRIFIC , KNOWLEDGEABLE & CARING DOCTORS!

I don't often find the time to keep up with my joint & trigger point injections like I need to, so to say I was a bit nervous because I have been having just awful knee pain in my right knee due to a nasty fall on cement over a year back, was an understatement.
It used to hurt from the moment I stood up getting out of bed in the mornings until the moment I fell asleep when I'm lucky to be so worn out I physicallycanxt stay awake anymore. We know pain can keep you up... my knee had been bugging me this much pre- injection. No joke. So sore! This weather has had it flaring like crazy.

But finally I found the time and asked about possible catching up on a few bothersome areas with Doc Phillips.  As I have 2 wonky knees and a hip that has significant nerve impingement also. IT was quite a relief he could start that same appt! I felt like it was my lucky day! I Was able to have Doc. P do the first one in my ""bad knee"" at my normal appt that morning....NO SCHEDULE AND COME BACK SILLINESS, IT WAS JUST SURE, I CAN DO THE FIRST ONE RIGHT NOW! (THAT was A TOTAL BONUS AS I Don't Live too close to this office and I really appreciated how there was no issue with scheduling)
He just had a consent form, came in the room got his PPE, GOT THE INJECTION SITE STERILECWITH AN ALCOHOL PREP OADN HAD THE INJECTION REASY & BOOM! EASY PEASY! I CAN HONESTLY SAY I DID NOT FEEL A THING! He is Fantastic with his needle skills... He had the full length of the needle in my knee and I had zero clue he had even started my injection! I looked down & just noticed the injection syringe was actually fully in my knee! Zero pain! (I have had a few where the old practitioner had to ""dig"" around in there to find the right spot to place the medicine ) Sadly, those were quite uncomfortable & left me sore for a few days after.... NOT HERE! Only Relief!

I was impressed & just really thrilled!  By the time I was checked out & getting back into my vehicle, I was expecting that familiar old crunch & burn lifting my leg up to get in.... It was already gone! Like no pinch, no burn, zero discomfort from the actual injection & the 3"" needle being in my knee not 5 mins before. It was JUST total relief! !!!
To me that is worth more than gold. The things we get used to with chronic pain are always there & we just deal with it at a level 3 on good days and the bad ones can feel like we get repeatedly bashed either with a very large sledge hammer, or it's a achey burning nightmare you can't function well with..  I'm used to that.

I am Not used to total relief! It is actually Amazing to Not have the constant pain anymore, since this last injection. I will sincerely tell you this:

Don't ever be nervous about injections with Doc Phillips! He is THE Best! I cannot wait for my next one, looking forward to this ""problem hip"" also feeling brand new!

>Great ""Needle Work""  He Has the calmest & most pleasant bedside manner too. The doctors here are both truly great listeners & will do everything they can to help you understand the treatment plan. The physical processes and with them, the difference thatcstands out to me is that you do not feel rushed or like just another number in a chart. They actually wait to be sure that you are fully ccomfortable & ready to have a procedure done. Both Docs here have that down!

Thank you again!|Dr. Phillips is amazing! He really knows how to treat his patients. He's very knowledgeable. He knows what to look for and treats you very quickly. He spends time with you and listens to you. I trust him. He's an excellent doctor. I highly recommend him!|Dr. Phillips is wonderful!! He takes the time to listen to your concerns, answers questions and walk you through the process of the procedures you'll go through  helping you feel more comfortable. His staff is also very good! Kaylee and Megan were always very kind when I called and helped every way they could. I would recommend Dr. Phillips to anyone who needed pain management.|Amazing. And very good at listening and figuring out what is going on. Haven't been pain free since I was 15. But thanks to this man I felt the feeling of no pain at all. Life changing. Highly recommend to everyone|Dr. Phillips and staff are exceptionally attentive to you and your concerns. Dr. Phillips is a rare find these days. He sincerely cares about me,  he understands why I am experiencing the severe chronic pain and has the compassion to treat me and provide a better quality of life.

I love the way i was treated.  Highly recommend this to anyone in pain. He had so much patience.|I have been dealing with severe neck pain for over 7 years, and I was initially hesitant about seeking help from a pain management clinic. However, my experience at Dr. Brent Henderson's practice has exceeded my expectations.

When I first visited, Dr. Henderson listened to my concerns and worked with me to develop a treatment plan focused on managing my pain. This plan primarily involved medication, although he also referred me to a surgeon to evaluate any underlying issues. I was relieved that Dr. Henderson took a comprehensive approach, rather than just relying on medication alone.

The medication regimen Dr. Henderson prescribed has provided me with significant relief during flare-ups, which has greatly improved my quality of life. I no longer have to worry about dealing with constant, debilitating neck pain. The staff at the clinic have also been incredibly helpful and understanding throughout my treatment.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the care I have received at Dr. Henderson's pain management clinic. They have helped me find an effective solution to manage my neck pain, and I would highly recommend this practice to anyone dealing with chronic pain issues.|They always listen and do their best to address the issue.

We went over my pain/symptoms, asking questions, explaining treatment options, and trying to come up with a plan. I never felt rushed or unheard. You can tell that they truly care about figuring out the root cause and letting you be included in your plan of treatment. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Booth and his staff!|I started seeing Dr. Jackson about 3 yrs ago because my dad was already a patient of Dr. Jackson and seeing how he took great care of my dad I stayed.

My dad passed away last Sept 2022 and the staff was so supportive. I see Megan mostly and she is extremely knowledgeable, caring and supportive in taking care of my health. One of the assistants Blake, I believe is his name is also very caring and supportive when my dad died. Ashlie, to this day has been so understanding and answers all my questions, even the questions that seem small in some people eyes.

My husband was a patient of Dr. Booths two years ago and recieved fantastic care, giving him much relief for pain in his neck.
I had an appointment on November 8th with Dr. Booth to see if he could help pain in my lower back. It is a 3 hour drive for us to make this appointment. I did not see Dr. Booth, but instead a PA. I was fine with that. The PA did a great job, was knowledgeable and we made a plan to try an injection in my lower back. I was told they would call the next day to set up an appointment. After a week of no call, I called them and was told they have only one person that schedules and she would contact me on Tuesday or Thursday. Again no call. I called twice more to only be told, they would call me. It has now been a month, the pain is horrible and no appointment in site from Elite. Last week I went to a different doctor and they have set me up for an injection next week. Thoroughly disappointed in Elite this time around.|Dr Booth and staff have treated myself and my husband amazingly! Always on time, professional, and go out of their way to accommodate us.

The only complaint I really have and it is not really a complaint,  is when I asked him to spray my back really well, because I have an extremely low pain threshold, that could have been better as I felt all the needles going in. Now maybe for reasons unknown to me, he could not do that. But he needed too tell me ahead of time that he couldn't, so I would know what to expect . Other then that he was very nice and I think maybe by the time he got to me, he might have been tired. I don't know, but whatever the reason, if I have to have this done again, he needs to spray that area really well. I think the shot is doing what it should as 3 days out I am feeling much better. The only pain I have is where he did the first shot.|Listen to the 1 star reviews and you will save your money. This guy has no interest in helping you, All he wants to do is give you expensive injections that he is told do not work, he will get you dependent on drugs and then scold you for taking them. His manner is condescending and rude. His staff are dismissive and only care about getting you in and out as fast as possible. He has an arrangement with the ""clinic"" across the road to send as many patients over as possible so they can also charge you vast amounts for procedures that you don't need.  I finally got off the Narcotics and went to a real doctor and my back has never been better. Stay away from Vincent and do more research, You have the power over your health do not give it to this money grabbing Quack.|The staff was super fast and friendly. I didn't have to wait long at all, and my procedure was over before I knew it. Dr Vincent was quick and precise. Very happy. Not looking forward to more injections, but happy I'm getting them here.|Dr. Vincent is the best pain management doctor hands down! I have seen two previous pain management doctors in the past for unrelenting back and leg pain/numbness. Neither of them gave me the relief that Dr. Vincent has. He really wants to help a person have less pain. He's a true gem of Oklahoma pain management medicine. His office staff is also exceptional. Easily a 5 star rating.|Dr. Vincent did some injections in my neck over a year ago and it has been very good since with no issues or pain, I received injections in my lower back a couple of days ago and it's been very good so far, I was having pain in my right hip and down my right leg but with physical therapy sessions and the injections it is back to normal.  Very pleased with Dr. Vincent and his staff.|Excellent Dr. Was very thorough with my condition,was very patient with me and explained everything to where I didn't have any questions.

I couldn't walk without holding onto my husband, my legs kept buckling, and constant pain 24/7.  Plus alot of pain and sleep meds. He gave me 2 steroid injections.  in my back.  Then the ablation!!! HALLELUJAH NO PAIN for almost a year.  Then 2nd ablation after that and no pain for longer this time.  Q|I have been seeing Dr Porter for about 4 years now and I am incredibly lucky to have found him! He always takes the time to discuss with me what we think will be best to reduce my pain. He has awesome bed side manner and truly cares about his patients! He takes the time to listen, discuss a plan and do what's best for me. Couldn't ask for a better dr!|Dr. Porter was great to work with for my husband's back pain. They got him in quickly, addressed his problems and was answering questions before we could ask them. His knowledge on what he does is impressive and appreciated. Highly recommend using this doctor.|Dr Porter is the best pain management Dr I have used, if you are hurting he is the place to go. If you want a caring, informative, very professional, to the point and not waste your time pain management Dr then this is the place to go. I see some people complaining about the pain of some of the shots he gives (which is very short term as well as expected of some shots, it's the nature of the treatment) but anyone like me laying around on a daily basis in severe pain know those shots are nothing compared to the amount of pain we deal with on a daily basis and totally worth it. He will not waste your time or money if he believes his treatment will not benefit you, he is down to earth and one of the biggest reasons of me not hating every moment of my life due to crippling pain. The office staff is nothing but the best, very polite, very attentive and always accommodating to my needs which are sometimes very high and they have not once hesitated to make my visits the best as possible. As for some of the comments below complaining it's a busy place of course it is! Anyone who uses Dr Porter doesn't want to use anyone but him because he is incredibly good at his job, definitely go here if you are in pain and need help you will not regret it.|If you are searching for a pain management doctor...  Hooray!  Your Search is over.

Dr. Justin Porter is a fantastic doctor.  I've had 3 back surgeries and could use a 4th to fuse the Si joint.  Dr. Porter and his magical epidurals allow me to keep walking, doing everyday activities, play with my grandkids and just have months without constant debilitating pain.  Dr. Porter has great bedside manner, he is one of two doctors I see that actually remember the last conversation we had, he is compassionate and he genuinely appears to care about your health and well-being.  Oh and every time I get an epidural I want to sing ""Come on baby make it hurt so good"".

The staff at Oklahoma Pain Management is amazing.  From the person who answers the phone to the person who assists in the area where you receive epidural.  Every single person I have encountered has friendly, respectful, cheerful and caring.   The best group of staff members I have encountered at a physicians offices.  There's always that one, but not here.

Like I said at the beginning of this review.... Hooray!  Your Search Is Over!

Thank you Dr Porter and Staff!|Wish NO star. I was referred by Dr. Boggs. I tried to make an appointment.  I called and left messages, twice, within a month. When I finally got a call back, I was told it would be another 2 weeks. When I tried to explain, the office lady was rude and hang up on me. So, I went to Dr. Lopez. He has an amazing staff and I was scheduled the day after my call.  I had a consult before my injections and he's very thorugh, I will gladly pay and refer him.|A semi turned in front of me causing me to hit him at 55 mph. Had lower back and neck injuries. Dr. Porter assessed injuries and started epidurals in both areas. Oral medications and the epidurals managed to get my pain levels down so I could function. Dr. Porter and his team did not quit until I was able to function with low to no pain in my daily life. They are awesome and really care for the patients. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Porter if pain limits your life and activities.|Was very skeptical at first about getting a shot in my back. I've heard stories from other people going to other doctors saying that the shot doesn't work and is a waist of time. I also heard that each doctor is different and some are better than others with the mix that they put in the shot, don't really know how true that is but made sense to me.
I feel lucky to have found Dr. Porter, the shot was amazing and worked really well. I barely even felt it. Went back a few weeks later for a follow up shot. I haven't slept this good in months, and recommend Dr. Porter whole heartedly.
Now it made my therapy with my other doctor much more productive and am I'm almost done with it. I'll start my own self therapy/exercise to keep it in shape, it's so much easier when it doesn't hurt.
So yes I give 5 stars, and if anyone is skeptical like I was, you'll never know until you Give it a Shot. It's worth a Shot lol.
Thanks Dr. Porter!",2023-12-21|2021-10-06|2021-04-27|2020-02-05|2017-12-07|2023-03-17|2020-09-24|2021-05-28,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJE71xxOwcsocR-fKXU0mXbOE,50

The establishment is easy to fine, inside is easy to maneuver, but it's not like any other clinic I've been too. Looks pretty down graded with the equipment they have when it comes to bigger establishments but they do with what they have.

I didn't appreciate my last visit because it too way too long for me just to get sent to the back room to prepare. They had a new Trainee check me in and get me settled she looked lost and kept forgetting things she need me to do or have. Then once onto the operating room, she failed 3x getting to stick an IV lock on my hand while the gentleman RN/CNA cleaned me up and got me with the first stick as if he ABSOLUTELY knew what he was doing. A hour appointment became a 4 hour waiting period.

Just like now, I'm here for a MRI scan follow up, but no notes were direct or reports and instructions were given from this Medical Clinic to my PCM to which scans I need or what they wanted directly. I had to see if my reports were in my medical reports and send them a copy instead of working together.

Now, once again I'm sitting here hoping this was just a quick 45-1 hour follow up appointment to discuss what needed procedures or process for the future. But I have to reschedule because I know I'm going to be here more than 3 hrs again if I don't.

I believe this clinic double even triple stacks appointments which causes these very long waits. But once you get what you're here for it goes quick, but the wait is annoying.|I've been meaning to write a review for Dr. Shadid, for a while now. I really like the Dr. and his team. Dr. Shadid is kind and compassionate. Earlier today I had a CERVICAL RADIQEREQUENGX NEUROTOMY. As with previous procedures there were no complications. He will routinely ask how you are doing during the procedure.
My quality of life has drastically improved over the last two years. We cannot stop the aging process, but with a good Doctor it's much more bearable|Been trying to get my wife in for 6 months they won't send a fax and won't see her without records the clinic I called and said they never received the fax to send the records to the clinic that needs it they won't talk to each other so we're sitting here still mated for 6 months and no one will do anything but look at each other like they're stupid|I've seen so many neuro and orthopedic surgeons in my day and Dr. Shadid outshines them all! What a miracle worker this man has been to me and my family.  He's thorough, caring, and really took his time to understand my medical history.  What a blessing he is!!|Dr.Shadid was amazing we've waited 4 years with my husbands back injury in the military to finally be validated with his pain. He took his pain seriously and his scans were looked at in depth would recommend him to everyone|The staff are a blissful bunch. Loved interacting with them. Unfortunately, the PA and the doctor wasn't communicating very well and I ended being so confused that I didn't know nor remember if I was getting steroids or whatever else he was shooting in me. I didn't appreciate being treated like some stupid nobody or like a guinea pig. When the PA and I would talk after each appointment, we came up with a game plan but I guess she neglected to informed the. Doctor and he blamed me and said I was lying when I tried to explain what works best for me. He refused to do what I was supposing and did what he wanted. He yelled at me for trying to explain what the PA and I decided. How can you treat someone in chronic pain like they don't know anything about their own body. It's sad really,  before Covid he was quite pleasant.|The work and the care is exemplary! The staff is very caring and helpful! Dr. Shadid and the work he does is amazing. He explained everything to me with care and compassion. I could barely walk at best due to the pain level in my back and legs. He was able to give me back my life. I am walking without a cane and can ride my motorcycle again. Thanks for giving me back my quality of life!|I've been a patient with Dr Edward Shadid and Spine & Pain Care of Oklahoma since 2013.

First off, the highly exceptional supporting staff under his tutelage is absolutely fantastic. They work in sync with Dr Shadid, to ensure that each patient feels comfortable, and an important priority that's seeking medical advice and technical expertise in the field of professionaly managed pain management services rendered.

Dr. Edward Shadid is more than capable of providing excellent insight into pain causation, suggests available treatment avenues to approach, in order to pinpoint targeted feasible solutions to help his patients achieve measurable results that dismantle, and in some cases eliminate the pain issues that have impacted his patients lives.

I've unfortunately endured a series of significant injuries over the course of my 20+ years of service rendered in the military that requires an in depth and ongoing effort to help me manage my continuous pain levels to within tolerable parameters, and Dr Shadid does an excellent job of providing tremendous and lasting relief for my complex pain issues.

I thoroughly enjoy visiting his office, and interacting with him and his beloved staff. They've always been extremely helpful, genuinely friendly and caring, accommodating of my variations of schedule, proactive, professional at every level from the welcoming greetings received to each heartfelt farewell.

The local Lawton office, which Dr. Shadid and his support team travels to from Oklahoma City, offers a plethora of pain solutions. And unlike a number of other professionals in this field of practice, Dr. Shadid even offers treatment services on Saturdays, to assist his patients that might not be able to benefit from his rendered services during the regular work week.

I am overwhelmingly pleased with the high quality medical care provided by Dr Edward Shadid and the phenomenal staff of Spine & Pain Care of Oklahoma, that has designed and administered a wonderful medical environment that is designed around the mantra of helping you live your best life, through well managed oversight, assessment and exceptional excellence in execution of their highly valued medical services.",2025-01-07|2025-02-17|2024-12-16|2024-05-04|2024-07-23|2023-09-06|2022-04-25|2023-06-07,3|5|1|5|5|2|5|5,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|10 a.m.",68.4|68.2|67.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","What kind of management do they do here","They offer spinal injections and pain management care, such as drug therapy, etc",long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ0eZshKEfrYcRaAM35q-dMQw,38

Due putting my trust in a season orthopedic surgeon of 25yrs he performed a surgery which was banned from orthopedic for 13 yrs in 2011. Due to lack of medical funding for research with any so called rarity medical conditions or diseases caused by profits for big pharmaceutical CRPS is not a pain management entity. It doesn't belong in it. True fact. Its the largest miss diagnosed medical entity in pain management. Its a progression disease period. There is no cure in the USA to date there is zero known medicine for CRPS, all the medications used are known to treat epilepsy, depression, anxiety etc. Which are extremely bad for a patient  with CRPS. They use medical research as a entity to do these things which actually puts the patient with CRPS is worse conditions. Its known fact. Full body is caused from no medical treatment and continual trauma to the affect nerve in the limb. CRPS is not a pain management entity, it belongs in internal and physical medicine due to its a progressive disease. A expert or a MD in the USA who's extremely knowledgeable would understand i need to see his internal medical records. He didn't want to. While if my previous provider did not authorize surgery on torn rotator cuff, its due to I'm at high risk having full body which on affects 4-6% of patients diagnosed with CRPS. I'm very observant and extremely knowledgeable due to living with it. In 9yrs I have met 2 experts and one very knowledgeable MD. My previous providers. This individual would understand via non existence  osteoarthritis in the cervical spine in 2018 to full blown with 5 moderate herniated disc. While understanding a hip socket that had no findings of osteoarthritis to full blown in 4 months while finding it in shoulder capsule via tore rotator cuff. CRPS actually mimics osteoarthritis its why it also gets miss diagnosed. It took me 18 months to litigate my own money to use for medical treatment in Italy. while now its on hold due to covid 19. I already applied for the permits. There is zero known treatment nor medicine in the USA for CRPS. I didn't research him prior to moving across country while providing my medical records to his facility which staff sat on i know I have a wonder relationship with my previous provider. Atrophy after 2 years of outer symptoms those out ward symptoms won't be noticeable its why you have to go into the internal medical records. I learned you cant get mad due to the lack of medical research and funding in the USA. While I actually sought out Ketimane only due to my previous provided never mentioned it. He's a anesthesiologists which is where Ketimane is used in, while becoming a experimental drug to treat depression. As he said quote it puts CRPS in remission there zero data to back it up. Its actually an experimental drug approved by insurances due to the massive loss of revenue via opioids there is zero cost analyst which means they can change what they want, its the new treatment spreading throughout  pain management. Yet individuals like me its very dangerous to even consider using, from being in a coma to server toxicity to liver. Its big pharmaceutical that pays the advertising to gain full access to the front google page. My previous provider said don't you dare use it, because the moment you agree to you free that MD from any liabilities. Hopefully while I have my colleagues looking for me so someone can treat the pain temporary til I get to Italy. Always do the footwork you are responsible for medical care, not the medical industry. You allow someone due to title without seeking out, well you can't get mad about your choices. I'm positive he's probably a really good pain management person.

They are organized and very caring.  Dr. Meta is a great listener and makes good suggestions for what may work best for your body. Please remember no two people will respond the same to some treatments.
The staff is very caring and squared away. There's handicap parking up front too. The staff even helped me get the necessary documents to assist in my tribal care. Dr. Meta also reviews your situation with you with X-rays and bone models when necessary to help you better understand your situation. If you will monitor and journal your aches and pains along with what you're doing to your body daily it can help the doctor better assess what your body is going through and make you good recommendations. Plan ahead and do what he tells you to do. It is a busy place for good reasons but you must schedule with them and keep real good notes in my opinion. Love this place and the staff and Dr. Meta.

He takes the time to address you as a real person. He not only provided more physical relief than anyone previously. He provided an understanding of what I was dealing with. He was supportive and helpful beyond average. He's worth a visit if you truly need help!|Where do I begin, Dr. Meta, is the most amazing doctor. His compassion cannot be measured in words. He takes his time with you, gets to know you, and takes an innovative approach.

They are so kind and compassionate.  They go above and beyond for you. They make you feel like a person not just a patient. I cannot thank Dr. Meta, and his staff enough for all they do. Much love to all of You!|Boy!!! When i say ""profiled n humiliated"" arent more than i can expressed. From My rights being violated by the so called nurse yelling in the waiting room thru the receptionist window ""we dont write narcotics"" as if i m a druggy or as if i expected or ask, to delayin my appt with repeated medical questions as if they gave a damn other than about my PMP. To the 10minute argument between me n the doc regarding my options of future medical treatment, he rudely decline. He admit to not willing to write for Ibuprofen if needed. Using my PMP as an excuse to profile n deny any treatment other than tge rude treatment he render. although he had a copy. I left so fast with him yelling ""dont ever come back"" due to my questions any patient should have the right to ask their doctor. A pain mgmt this facility isn't- A uncaring unprofesaional cruel doctor he is.lastlly, i was open to injections but to insult me as if i hav a history with him but only seen him twice over 5 years, said alot bout his character.

Trust me, I wouldn't of been going there this long had I not trusted, respected & was totally comfortable with him. He's always done everything he could to be sure I was comfortable. I've had 3 back surgeries, a plate in my neck & both hips replaced. I've had some bad times, not his fault, was because his has were tied with the new laws that have come out.

I highly recommend this facility|Dr Anthony was a compassionate Dr that treated his patients as individuals and NOT just a number $$$ walking through the door. Since his retirement this place has gone way down hill.  The way Dr Franklin is not willing to work with patients with the treatment plan they were on with Dr Anthony is cold and uncaring.  I was taking certain meds that I had been on and were working effectively at keeping me an active person with the least pain possible. Dr Franklin basically said everything Dr Anthony was doing was wrong and was treating the wrong issues.  This is absolutely false and just a ploy to do more injections which are not even approved by the FDA and will in the long wrong cause more harm than good. Healthcare in this country and government bureaucracy is making people feel devalued, causing more harm and effectively reducing quality of life.
Good job PMOT, Dr Franklin and Dr White for putting the government and money over patients you swore to do no harm.|This place has the best doctors and the nurses that bring you out are phenomenal but the nurse that checks you in and gets iv ready needs to go... she is sooooo rude to the patients and NOT friendly at all.... This place could really be 5 stars if not for her|The nurse was fantastic! Tracy White was not even cordial.  She walked in, didn't even introduce herself. I paid $45 copay to have a nice conversation with the nurse. White stated I needed a MRI of each before she could discuss anything! I was amazed that she wasn't going to discuss PT, TENS unit, an injection...NO! When I asked why I paid $45 to not do anything, she said she would call me with my test results rather than have me come in & pay again...WOW, thank you soooooo much for your help!!!! You are fired|I have been seeing Dr.Anthony going on 16 years... Trust me when I say he is a caring companionate Physician. never did I feel he was just a pill writer. Excellent bed side manner.     if your suffering from chronic pain he will suggest multiple options.

Note: I have research The opioid issue to death, May I suggest you do too. Pain Doctors are having to Re learn there craft. The DEA among other agencies absolutely are the ones restricting prescription! After all my years with him I assure you he will do everything in his power to keep you as comfortable as he can.

I have never been in a situation as I had found myself in.

Dr. Fulp still kept helping me even though all odds were against me. I appreciate his willingness to hear me as a person and not just another patient.

I definitely would highly recommend him. I feel like he is a good Dr to have in your corner if you need help. He will help you or try his best to do what it takes to help. We need more doctors like this.|I've had the pleasure of seeing both Dr. Chan and Dr. Fulp, both were very professional, thorough and truly listened to my concerns and needs regarding my health. You can tell that they really care and want to help you. I highly recommend them!|Everyone at this clinic is so nice from the front desk to the nurses and of Dr Chan. Never rush you, take time and really do what they can to help you live a more pain free life. They recently put a spinal chord stimulator in my husbands back (trial one) and Paige the medtronics rep even called to check on him everyday during the trial. Allysia is awesome and has the best sense of humor, she does anything she can to make you feel welcome and comfortable. The stimulator has helped my husband so much and has truly been a blessing when it comes to pain relief for him. We can not wait to get the permanent one installed!!!! Dr. Chan goes above and beyond to make sure that everything goes well and is also very kind.|Before I started seeing Dr. Folk I was in so much pain I couldn't get out anymore or spend quality time with my kids. After seeing him for a few months my pain is manageable enough to where I can live life and get out again. The best part about dealing with Memorial Pain Clinic and Dr. Folk in particular is no bs and he will get down to your root issue and find a solution. They also offer flexibility for patients such as allowing me to do a virtual visit when the roads were covered in snow/ice a few weeks ago. This was important to me because I drive an hour round trip and would have had to cancel my appt otherwise and been without my meds. I wouldn't recommend any other pain Clinic or Dr to deal with chronic or ongoing pain because these guys will get shit done!|I've seen Dr Chan for many years for a back injury. I see him for injections every few months and he gets it right every time! I'm able to go longer between injections because of his consistency. I highly recommend him & his staff!|Dr Chan and the staff are amazing. Very friendly environment. Heather
,Dr Chan's nurse is very knowledgeable and listens. She goes out of her way to make sure you are taken care of. Very compassionate. Dr Chan listens to me and communicates on every level|Dr Chan is awesome and Allysia is absolutely the best!!! They have made such a difference in our lives with getting my husband the spinal stimulator and have always been kind and respectful and never make you feel rushed. They go above and beyond|Good, morning my name is tyla clemmons and I have been going to Memorial Pain Clinic for 6 months. Dr Caroline Wescott was my doctor ( I had been seeing her for 3 yr) but she moved to Memorial Pain Clinic.  So I followed her to this pain management.  But she is no longer there anymore (  it's bittersweet) But now I see Dr Fluip and he's great. He listened to what was going on with me. He is very respectful and he doesn't try to rush you. So I love the ladies at the front desk  they have the best customer service I have seen they are nice, sweetie humble, and professional and I never see them on their Cell phones (that's A+)  also  The staff in the back from the nurse to the ones that help Dr. Chan in the surgery room. They are very professional, humble, and patient.  And Dr Chan he is great he talks to you when he sees you having a high heart rate before he puts you under. Cause Lords know my anxiety be going. The nurse in The Back is also great always nice, sweet & kind, & very professional. If It was up to Me This place & Everyone in that building would get employment Of The Year My Favorite about this place is its always clean and even the bathroom.

He has genuine care for me and monitors my medication intake appropriately, while ensuring my chronic pain is managed as well as we are able to work together to manage it.|I've been taking my mother here for about four years, and I can vouch for Dr. Amer Noah.  I think he is a truly good man, and my respect for him as a person and a doctor cannot be overstated.  I also think he is deeply restrained by the criminalization of pain clinics and opiate prescriptions more generally.  Be aware that while you will be helped, the place is usually booked up, so you might have to wait a spell.  They have plenty of seating, but there's only one bathroom for everybody to use, so that's really the only pain point.|Dr Nouh tries to see everyone with an appointment. I've been 20 min late and was still seen. I've been sick and the appt was turned into a virtual visit. I've had many issues getting links via text and we've found a way to make it happen.

He is strict when it comes to HIPAA and it doesn't matter if the patient verbally says it's ok. If not in writing, then not ok.

He's great at giving injections! He uses X-ray to guide him and talks to the patient throughout the process.

The first couple appointments were difficult as we didn't have an understanding of each other. I'm glad I have kept seeing him for the years that I have. He's a great Dr and he's helped me a lot! He's informative when I have questions and helps when I need it.|Dr. Nouh is awesome. I have been going to him for years. The staff is wonderful and caring. They really listen and care about your issues. Absolutely recommend.|Worst experience I have ever had with any Dr. in my entire life!   Very judgmental of people's looks, accuse my fiance of having medication in his system that clearly was not even on his UA!  For what reason? because he doesn't like the way he looks!  Will be making phone call to whomever I can find to report this type of behavior!   Do not recommend! Put one star only because you can't leave blank!|This clinic is awesome.

Thank you all So much for taking such great care of me! 10/10 I definitely recommend this clinic for all your pain management needs!|I have been a patient here since Dr B was around. He was compassionate and kind. He was one of few drs that actually had knowledge about my complex, rare syndrome. It was awful when he passed.
The Dr that took is place, Dr Lovell, is great.
He takes time to talk to me about all my concerns during my appointment. He makes sure that I stay on a medication that meets my needs, the lowest dose possible while treating my severe pain issues. I have an autistic child and I need something that won't make me drowsy or feel off in any way, i need to be at my best 24/7.
His staff are awesome, I'm always happy to see Ashley and the girl who does the UA cups (I'm bad with names). The other nurse, the guy, is always friendly and nice to talk to.
As I can tell, they follow all the rules and procedures and that makes me feel secure in my choice for a pain management dr, as others have been closed in the past.
When I call they always answer my questions about insurance or refills or whatever they may be.
They also allow me to bring my son which Dr Bs staff did not. I am grateful for that.|**only 5 stars so everyone can see this brutally honest review. It took me 3 months of calling to even get an appointment. And then every. Single. Month. I was seen, the wrong prescriptions were sent in and it was always up to me to catch their mistakes. The doctor is exhausted- he works at an ER too and is barely even there. They are absolutely dead set on very specific medications and don't take what the patient says into account. Sounds like a certain office must be getting some medical kickbacks. Even when I was promised by the office manager that something would change- nothing changed at all. Fully incompetent- I would rather be in agony every day  than ever get put on the back burner  by this doctor again.|I've been a patient here for a few years now and I can't say enough good things about it. I want to specifically shout out their nurse Ashley for taking the time to get to know the patients and treats everyone with kindness, dignity,  respect, and slides in a few laughs here and there.

It was quick and very easy and smooth...  sadly, it didn't last long for my injury and I will need to go back to get another one that targets the injured vertebrae.. 
UPDATE.. Went back and had  multiple facet block injections - which temporary took the sharpness from the pain but it came back and didn't work well..
Sadly, the neurosurgeon declined to operate due to the amount of scar tissue in my spine and I will most likely have injections every 6 months or so..

They hire exceptional Doctors as Dr Nevinson Sam is a great Doctor who has empathy and very much cares for his patients. Dr. Sam has been my Dr almost 5 years now and I couldn't ask for a better Doctor than him. At least he listens to you and lets you have a part in your plan of care . If anyone wants a great pain Doctor that cares you need Dr Sam. I wouldn't give him up for any other Dr. That's for sure|At first they did great, took care of my shoulder and everything was going smoothly. When it came to my back well that was a completely different story.

First he wanted me to pay $900 to do an mri at his hospital but my insurance covered 100% of my mri at a free standing clinic. He told me, ""oh those free standing mri images are blurry"". That was a lie because I spoke with both my insurance company and the mri staff and they said it's the exact same machine.

Then, after my mri I didn't hear anything back from him for almost a month,  my rheynauds dr asked me about it and I told her I haven't heard anything about it,  so she calls and WALA you guys call me back that same day.

Finally the best part, you guys call and tell me my insurance approved it and that you want to schedule me for injections at that hospital. I'm sure I'm not your first patient and I'm sure you knew this was going to happen but you didn't even question it or mention that just 4 days before my scheduled appointment the hospital calls and tells me I have to pay $7,511 by Monday.

After I already requested the day off work, so did my driver, now we both wasted a sick day from work because I can't come up with $7,511 in 4 days. You knew what insurance I have, I'm sure you knew that was going to be an issue, but rather than telling me that you went ahead and scheduled my appointment and wasted my time along with getting my hopes up of finally being out of pain.

I felt like you're just trying to keep your hospital afloat by doing everything there and telling people that they have to pay for everything done there rather than using what their insurance covers. Sorry but nobody has $7,511 to drop in a 4 days notice, or even $900 especially when it's covered 100% by insurance.

The very next clinic I called even said that was ridiculous and that they would make sure that my insurance covers EVERYTHING  before scheduling an appointment especially one that requires me having to get a driver to take me home.|Dr Sam has showed so much concern for me since the first day I walked into his office for a consultation 2 months ago. I was going in to see what he thought he might be able to do for some neck pain that I have been dealing with for close to ten years. This man actually listened to what I had to say about where my pain was and you could tell he was really trying to figure me out. The very next week after I had my consultation, I had another visit and walked away almost pain free. Not only did I walk away almost pain free, but the next morning he called me to see how I was feeling. Three weeks later I had another appointment with him to get an epidural in my spine and every person on Dr Sam's team has been nothing but phenomenal. Again, Dr Sam called me to make sure I was doing okay and he was making sure I didn't have any questions. If you're dealing with chronic pain, do yourself a favor and go see this man. If he can even do half of what he did for me, you'll be glad you did.|The visit to Dr Sam's office was the most pleasant experience.  The Doctor and his staff and very helpful and nice. He is like your Primary Physician and friend.|Terrible doctor and team. I believed at first he was going to be able to help me with my chronic pain I deal with every moment of my life. Even suggested once I get disability that he would put in a spinal cord stimulator. But after my follow up visit his demeanor changed and said that based on my images I should not be in pain and he was going to refer me to neurologist. He then started becoming increasingly agitated at me for not improving putting me on medications for treatment. I could t help that my pain didn't change. He then said that he couldn't help me and was dropping me as a patient. His office called me a few days later saying they didn't know of any doctors that took self pay and wished me luck. His office is all extremely difficult to get in touch with as well and very passive aggressive toward you if they do not like something you say about how they are writing down false statements from you about your pain and downplaying your symptoms. I told them one day my pain was an 8 and they labeled it a 6 and when I brought it up to them he aggressively wrote back at me saying his report is accurate. When it was in fact false.|They are great. The staff is always pleasant. Dr. Sam takes the time and listens. I believe they care about me and that's hard to find in today's medical world.|When I first saw Dr Sam he genuinely ""seemed"" to care. I'd only seen him a couple of times when things started to change. I have chronic pain, severe Fibromyalgia,  bone spurs in neck, frozen shoulder, low back and tailbone pain,trouble standing/walking/sitting amoung other things. First he made me feel like a liar and suggested pain therapy.  Like it was all in my head. Said he put in a referal for that. NOPE NEVER HAPPENED. He finally put me on muscle relaxers and a low dose nalocet. Very low dose. Not very helpful but I tried them. As I've lived with this pain without medication for years it's easy to say that it didn't put a dent in my pain. They werre to take as needed for pain.
Dr Sam also said he would refer me to a neurologist and maybe a surgical pain pump my help.NEVER HAPPENED NO REFERAL. He also said he would refer me to physical therapy for my shoulder. NEVER HAPPENED NO REFERAL! He also said he would up my dose to a whopping 5mg.
I went in for my appointment and had to pee in a cup. Didn't know why but I did. He called me later and said that he would no longer prescribe me pain meds because there was no trace in my urine of the low dose. Im sorry was there supposed to be? So dont get addicted  but take them all the time even if not needed? Im so confused. I am 51 years old. I took them as needed. He warned me they could be addictive so I tried to take them only when my pain level was over 6. Next thing I know I'm being treated like a common criminal. New prescriptions not filled and kicked to the curb without warning. Even the non-opiod pills not filled. Why? For not wanting to get addicted. My follow up appointment was canceled  without my knowledge and not rescheduled.  I called them to ask why with no return call! I am not a druggie/dealer and I hate that the damn addicts have messed it up for us truly suffering.
Dr Sam doesn't care about me or my suffering. Cut me off like extra baggage.  Maybe because I am low income on Soonercare! Not getting the money from those HMO's from me. Doctors seem to forget that they work for us! They are supposed to help us. You need to check your ego at the door, get off your soapbox, and get back to helping people. Unacceptable behavior from you and your staff!!!|In a decade and a half even with my Lupus, RA, Fibromyalgia And other auto immune diseases, Dr Sam it's the first doctor that ever wanted to do test to find out what the true cause of my pain.",2025-02-20|2025-02-14|2024-12-10|2025-02-27|2024-11-17|2025-02-22|2024-09-28|2025-02-06,5|1|5|5|1|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJS9YbNNcTsocRopybOO752N0,31

Everyone in the office is awesome, helpful, carrying and understanding. Dr J. Miller is the best pain management doctor I have found since 2017 well worth my two hour drive. Did I say the staff is awesome and a  very clean and happy environment. Dr Miller has a winning staff and needs to clone them when it's legal. Or give them a pay increase. I would go one thousand miles to see Dr Miller and Staff it's rare to find a doctors office ran like a well oiled machine with excellent staff. 100|Dr  Miller is an excellent ""example "" of a good Doctor!
Addition:  I have continued to see Dr Miller over 2 years now.  In my professional ""as a retired Law Enforcement official and a Clinical psychotherapist"", he is an excellent physician!   His bedside manner is excellent, his expertise and explanation of procedures is outstanding.  I would recommend him to my family or friends!|Absolutely a great doctor. Just about the best I have ever had. I highly recommend him.|I have been a patient of Dr.Miller for several years. First I'm very picky in my HCPs. I will not stay with one that is not the best. It takes an intelligent mind and witty humor to keep me coming back. Dr appts are no fun , but I actually look forward to these appointments as his team are just as remarkable as he is as they take care of patients during routine visits and the occasional hiccup. This office doesn't scream clinical office which my CPTSD definitely can appreciate. The office is always clean as are the individual rooms that in itself are seemingly designed to calm your nervous system which it does quite well.
If you are searching for a great bedside manner, yet funny and knowledgeable and understanding physician Dr.Miller is the guy.
Give this Greatest Of All Time Physician a chance. You wont regret it as your anxiety and pain melts away and you leave in a better mood than when you entered.|I would NOT recommend Dr. Miller to anyone with life-long chronic pain. He does not take time to fully hear his patients concerns and lacks empathy. I have been in the room when a patient explains they are in horrible pain and he is very reluctant to give medication. He would rather his patients suffer and ""deal"" with pain than prescribe enough medication to keep them comfortable. He told us, ""It will be a rough few days but hopefully things will be better in a few days"", he acknowledged the patient would go through pain and didn't care. We even requested to add medications like steroids and hormones to help with pain management since he won't keep his patient comfortable with pain medication and he shut down those ideas also. He is inexperienced in nerve pain and has poor bedside manner.|My visit and trial with Dr Miller was great. His staff, they are very good. . Dr Miller has installed a pain pump, it's great.

Injections terrible experience no count down or warning before the needle is inserted !  all the 1 stars are true ! Wish I didn't waist my time and  insurance on this place! An I seem to be in more pain on the injection site! Horrendous experience glad I put a stop to this myself!|I've been helped by Dr Boeckman and his incredible staff for several years now.  First, I love his preference for injections over surgery.  Pain management is my preference over surgery.  However, when I had an accident, he immediately ordered an MRI (because of my neck injury I needed a standing up MRI).  When he realized I needed surgery (to avoid damage to my spinal cord) he/his staff secured me a fast track access to a great surgeon.   His follow-up and care for my neck - as well as his continued care for my lumbar and thorasic spine have been great.

His staff is also awesome. They take personal interest in you, and work to meet the needs of your schedule and care needs.  I'm almost 60 and while my need for doctors have increased in the past few years, there is no doubt their staff stands out as the most understanding and workable with your situation.  (They have no control of insurance limitations/rules, or state laws.  They maintain high integrity in these matters. So when they - on a rare exception - tell you they can't do what you are asking/wanting, you must understand their high ethics and standards!)

I continue to recommend everyone (among my friends/social connections) with pain management needs to go to Dr. Boeckman!|Holly his Nurse practitioner is really nice! She listens and does her best to help relieve your pain. Dr Boeckman is very good and very knowledgeable. He also has a great sense of humor! He listens and responds to your needs. I would recommend his practice without reservation!|Horrible doctor. He doesn't listen well and both his nurses lie. They say they will call you back and never do. Especially the fat one with glasses. If you are of color this office is not it. My partner was with this office when Dr. Meyer was around. Now he was a good doctor then boeckman took over. Glad we found another pain management office.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!|Dr. Boeckman is amazing! He's extremely thorough, patient, kind & understanding. He has never rushed my appointments, he listens to & answers all my questions in a way that I understand. He's very personable & an expert in his field. I completely trust Dr. Boeckman. My husband and I both have been seeing him for quite a while and we're 100% satisfied with the care we receive. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a pain management doctor.|Dr Boeckman and his staff are wonderful people !  Dr. B always takes time to explain everything and answer all my questions, even the stupid ones! I have never been pushed to have anything done, always given time to think  and decide! When I had the procedure done on my lower back, which by the way is no where near your kidneys folks, it was the best decision I have ever made! Awesome  relief! His staff, including Ms Julia are the best!   From day one they have treated me well!  I love them all!  Since I think i have a nickname, my name is June Williams! Any negativity about this place is just not true! Dr B stays busy constantly! He must be doing something !  Makes sense! He may be young but he knows what he's doing! I reccomend to everyone looking for a good pain management doctor! Dr Matthew Boekman! #1 in my books!|Very satisfied with Dr Blackman and his staff. His staff is always nice and friendly and very helpful. Been going for about 6 months now when I was told I needed surgery and he has helped with my pain. He listens to my issues and will explain what my options are in detail and answers all my questions even the stupid ones. He takes the time nneded to make sure you understand everything and doesn't act like he is in a rush to get you in and out like so many other doctors do. Also, if he can't help you he will tell you instead of doing a procedure that won't work.I would recommend him to anyone looking for relief without all the pills other doctors seem to push.|Horrible doctor. My mother has had severe back pain and several surgeries to the point where she can barely walk now since retiring back in 2011. This doctor ONLY wants to give her shots to make money from whatever kickbacks he gets. He started out giving her pain meds then refused the meds because of a sleeping medication she is on( which she has been on for 20 plus years). I understood the concerns he had however he kept prescribing her meds to manage her pain then out of the blue WOULD NOT fill her medication. Then would refill her pain medication the next visit. It's like he gets a sick gratification out of making his patients suffer.  She finally was diagnosed with shingles along with her back pain and he decided to cut her off cold turkey. My mother is 70 years old and is having to deal with all this pain with no help at all. He called her on a Friday and said he could no longer do anything for her. Anyone of color do NOT go to this doctor as he does not care about you!

I was dreading leaving my old pain mgmt dr due to a change in my insurance, but I am so pleased with his care. His bedside manner is unmatched. Had a rocky start with the office staff due to some things being missed/delayed, but they've hired new people now, and when all is said and done, I got the pain relief I needed.|If I could give 0 stars I would.  My husband had an autoimmune and after over a year of this doctor and that doctor and waiting waiting and having the pain worsening we were recommended this place.   After the first visit we were so excited to get some answers.  We tried to wait a few months for the next appointment but his pain was out of control.  Long story short Dr. Wallace talked of all the things that could help him and didn't explain what was happening today then a nurse comes in talking about a contract that he needs to sign where he can't take any other needs including marijuana.  My hubby got upset at first because that's the only thing that was giving him any relief so they sent in another nurse.  He talked to her,  he calmed down,  he signed the contract and was to take a UA. He couldn't urinate because that's part of the pain and autoimmune and they said you can do it next time but they would send a script and referral for an MRI.  They would then not return calls, there was no prescription sent but finally the order for MRI came thru.  Months after that we called to get a followup and they said the doc will call you when he's reviewed everything and is ready.  Still nothing.  Come to find out they decided not to help my husband at all but instead referred him out without a word of this to us. This is horrible practice and if they can't tolerate upset people in pain why are they there? How can a professional ""people helper""  not have the decency to tell people they aren't going to treat them? #worstplaceever|Dr Wallace is my mother-in-law's pain doctor. She called on a Friday to see if she could have her pain medicine called into the pharmacy. They advised her that this was against the regulations. She had an appointment for Monday I took her to that appointment. When she said something about not having her medication through the weekend they again told her that it was against their policy. But then the nurse look through her file and said actually they were supposed to call in a 30-day the week prior. So the whole thing was their mistake. When we got to the pharmacy the prescription still wasn't ready and after lunch it still wasn't ready. After trying to get ahold of them for quite a while finally they answered and they said that they would have it in by the end of the day. They said they would make sure this was the first one that they called in. 7:00 p.m. that night when the pharmacy closed they still didn't have her medicine in. I honestly didn't seem to care very much!!!|I had been seeing Dr. Wallace for over a year when he was at Pain Management of Tulsa and, I'll be honest, he seems like one of the nicest, most caring doctors you'll meet (besides Dr. White).

But the truth is that he turned his back on a whole lot of patients who were kicked out of Pain Management of Tulsa's practice because Dr. Wallace and Torgerson left 1 day after the new opiate prescription law passed.

My assumption is that they did this knowing that now, every person requiring pain medication for longer than 3 weeks is being forced by the DEA and a bunch of non-doctor politicians to go into pain management clinics.

This tells me that Dr. Wallace may seem as though he cares, doesn't. He saw a very lucrative opportunity and without a thought to those who might suffer as a result, he took his bundle of cash and left.

I don't fault Wallace for wanting to become super-wealthy; I fault Wallace for leaving his patients without an option and in pain. Their pain, his gain.

And from other reviews I've read about Wallace, it turns out he may be a shot-jock who wants to charge your insurance as much as possible for a 5-minute shot that does nothing but exacerbate your back problems and suppress your immune system unnecessarily - all for the sake of money.

Visitor beware.|Dr Adam J Wallace is the absolute best Dr I personally have ever seen for chronic pain treatment. (I really wish he was family practice as well)

The (1) negative reviewer has it quite the opposite, imho. I personally believe PMT mostly kept only the patients they could qualify to see every 4 weeks, hence more money. It would make no sense for these two doctors to leave any of their patients behind, what kind of medical practice would they have with no patients?? Actually, there are several things in that review that make no sense.

Dr Wallace genuinely cares about his patients as people, not simply chattle for dollars. He is so very supportive, kind and caring. He takes the time to know his patients as individuals, their life, and to fully understand their best interests in treatment plans. He's anything but a money grabber. Best pain management Dr I've had for helping my life be manageable while living with excruciating life debilitating chronic pain. Any legit pain patient would agree. He ""gets"" my desire to live life to the fullest with the utmost quality of life possible. I never feel like I've been farmed out to a pill mill clinic. And I will forever be grateful for the lifestyle I'm able to live thanks to Dr Wallace and the fabulous medical team at the new place.

They care. They make all the difference in the world for my treatment. I highly recommend Dr Adam J Wallace for pain management.

Personally, I only stayed on at PMT because it was well worth stepping thru the minefield to receive treatment from Dr Wallace. I'm very happy to support their new venture beyond PMT.

Sincerely,
B-|I switched Pain doctors back in Feb I believe cause I was NOT happy with my other pain Dr.. I had been with them since 2006..
I switched to Dr Wallace office.. First of all the ladies @ the front desk AND the nurse is so sweet & friendy.. They welcome you with a warm welcome. This doctors office actually ANSWERS THE PHONE & RETURNS YOUR CALLS...

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE|Before Dr. Wallace I was seeing a pain doc. Who never run test! But looked at my chart an said there was no hope! That all he could do was pump me full of high power meds! An that's all he did! Until i was lucky enough to leave the clinic one day! That was when I met Dr. Wallace! The first thing he did was start running tests! An he changed my meds!! I'm not taking meds as powerful as I was! But he is still able to control my pain! He said he was determined to find cause! Where the other doc didn't care! I discovered two things the first year! (1) I have two things causing all the numbness an neuropathy "" damage from surgery  and my bad kidney) that docs almost waited to long to remove! (2) an the tiny bones in my lower back have somehow been completely crushed! He's been trying to figure out how since he found it! An I believe he'll figure it out eventually!  It's not often you find a doctor who truly cares about what (he/she) does! Thank you Dr. Wallace for caring!|Excellent care!  Great doctor!

He pried at my response so I told him I wasn't expecting to see him 45 minutes past my appointment time. He responded that there's a lot of paperwork to complete. I responded that I arrived at 0930, 30 minutes early to my appointment in order to complete the paperwork. He said I could have arrived at 6 am and it wouldn't matter and that who's supposed to fill out the paperwork, the holy ghost? He then told me he has nothing for me and the appointment was over. He never treated me. Then he tried to make me leave the facility without getting a print out from the front desk to prove I came to the appointment. The receptionist refused and stated that ""it would be faxed"" and the Dr came to the waiting room 2 more times while I was on the phone with the VA to tell me to get out and yell at me.

However, one week after my first appointment, I had to call in and see if she could adjust my medications. I called only once (and went to voice mail) and I waited for three weeks for a call back. I do not like constantly calling medical services as I know they get very busy. However, after not receiving a call for three weeks, I have decided to cancel any future appointments as I felt she did not have any concern for my wellbeing.|I'm giving the center 2 stars because Dr Torgerson is a good doctor and did his job well. However, his support staff was terribly incompetent. I was scheduled for a series of 7 injections. When I came in for the 1st injection, which my husband took off work so he could be with me, I was denied the injection because no one told me to stop taking the aspirin my cardiologist has me taking. Half a day of income lost and no pain relief. That seems like it would have been a good time for them to review pre- procedure instructions which were completely neglected before but I wasnt told anything else when I asked. Came back the next week and was turned away AGAIN because no one said I couldn't eat before the injection. I asked for the instructions to be emailed to me, but I never received them. Ridiculous|I've been going here for the last four months with everyday lower back pain, do my l5 and some sort of disc in my back super jacked up they have tried muscle relaxer. After muscle relaxer, and nothing gives me any kind of pain. And after going through this for so long, I swear it has been literally five months, at least i don't sleep more than an hour. If that a night trying to get through annoying a** pain, i'm having all the time in my back radiating down my leg well, when I set up appointments here I go in. We literally sit in there for about 20 minutes. Figuring out what medications to give me not what procedures we are going to do to make me better or anything like that. I have to bring it up if I want to talk about procedures. I'm not a doctor. I don't know what to ask. I feel like they take advantage of you. Yes, doctor wallace is a cool doctor it seems like he cares, but his staff are super lost and I don't think they know what they're doing. I just recently went to advanced orthopedics to reach for help for pain management. So I'm hoping this will help. I would stay clear from this place. They really don't help they let me leave everyday in pain, not really caring about what I was dealing with.|I had to wait forever. I've been in unending pain looking for help and the doctor said I had to redo all my MRIs and he wasn't going to do anything for me until that was done Even though he had the information, and my MRIs were all within a year or so. Dr. Torgensen is very not understanding. Very unprofessional all around, waiting room was packed and I feel I was rushed through everything after waiting for a full 30 minutes after my appointment time for the doctor. I question The professionalism and the credibility completely. You couldn't pay me to return to this place|if I could give zero stars, I would.... First and foremost I had to come with my two year-old who has autism so that's another stressor within itself. When I arrived the place was packed. I stood at the front desk for about five minutes which was packed also nobody acknowledged us so I went to go sit down. After about 10 minutes when the line slowed...I got back up to show them that I'm here and once again the front desk did not acknowledge me. so now I wait 20 minutes and go back up there and they finally acknowledge me by this time. I'm late for my appointment which was at 10:30... I didn't get seen till 1130 and I noticed that this place over packs the area... I don't know if they schedule people around the same time, but there was barely any place to sit and you would think with a lot of the clients being elderly that this place would take that into consideration but unfortunately they don't. so if you come here and get scheduled, bring u a chair...you'll be in the waiting room packed like sardines. lastly, after meeting with Dr. Torgeson, he was very offputting showed very little to no compassion and when I was trying to explain things to him on what I have been through up to now... He kept saying it sounds like you need surgery... It sounds like you want surgery, make a long story short he recommended me get a updated MRI of my neck which I plan on doing. but I also told him I was having issues with my middle spine. He didn't address that at all. But This is the kicker...why did Mr. Torgesen sign me up for a MRI in Edmond Oklahoma when we're obviously in Tulsa.... knowing I didn't have no vehicle and I'm there with my two year-old autistic child. We definitely won't be back.|I've seen many doctors in my 40+ years, and Dr. Wallace is the best I've worked with. I agree with another reviewer that his bedside manner is unsurpassed. He is kind and caring, he explains things in a way that's easy to understand, and he genuinely listens to my concerns. I just wish I could see him for all of my medical concerns! Thank you, Dr. Wallace, for being an amazing human being!|I'm sure the doctor is great, but the clinic has astonishingly unhelpful staff. My sister has been trying since Halloween to get them to finish the paperwork and red tape of approving a procedure everyone agrees she needs, leaving her in daily pain that is sometimes enough to leave her bedridden. SHE, the PATIENT IN PAIN, is having to use her limited functional time to nag them daily now, and is constantly being told conflicting things, or that there is one more thing to be done.

They show their concerns and they let you know and go above and beyond. The ladies in the office are amazing and the atmosphere is great. I have  a few illnesses and see way too many doctors which gets tiring, so it is great to go there and everyone there treat you like family. They remember you, they are all down to earth, professional. They listen, they care, they are by the book as well. If another doctor doesn't do what they need to do Dr Nelson makes sure it gets done.|This office is very rude. Dr Nelson treats his patients like bad children and acts like he doesn't care what happens to them. Dr Murat no longer works there probably because he fired him. He's been known to go in and fire his entire office this is how Dr Nelson treats people including his staff. Doesn't treat his patients any better and calls some of his patients liars!!!  I don't recommend Dr Nelson to anyone!!!!  If I could give this doctor less then one star I would but since I can't I only gave him 1 star!!!!|I have been a patient of Dr. Nelson for a little under two years now. I have never not once felt like they dont care. Marute is the best always making me feel like a priority,very profeasional. The doctors are great, some office staff could use a course or two in sensitivity and patient satisfaction. I recommend Dr.Nelson to anyine living with pain, he is very knowledgeable and experienced in this area and will do everything he can to help you.|This is was a TERRIBLE experience!! He just wants to write you pain medicine and send you out the door...If that's what you want then great...NOT ME! I want a solution to my pain not to just put a Band-Aid on it. Not to mention, all the patient files are paper and he spends a lot of time flipping through your paperwork to figure out what's wrong with you....He doesn't know your history at all! I had a procedure done on a Monday and 3 days later had a follow-up for the procedure and he didn't even remember doing it...said ""Oh yeah, well how did that go?"" I'm like...uhh YOU DID IT!! The staff is not much to mention either. I was supposed to be scheduled for another procedure and they just didn't call to schedule me. I called a week later and they said their new ""procedure suite"" isn't ready yet and it will be another 2 weeks. Really?! Happy to find a new doctor.|This office is so unprofessional. I have had to drive over there due to them not answering phone calls. My mother shows up and they tell her that her appointment was the day before or last week. They were collecting $50 each visit despite her having met her out of pocket. By the time I caught on, they owed her over $800. Now, they are abruptly discontinuing medication she has been on for over 5 years. But they still expect her to come to the office? For what? Why are you still charging her insurance for doing nothing!? If you are no longer providing her with a service, stop scheduling appointments.
Irresponsible and negligent.  Pain management patients need to be weaned off medication. Of course, I just tried to call them to discuss this and I got a ""voicemail isn't set up yet"" message. Of course!|I had my first appointment a few days ago. I had no problem whit any staff or doctors. I spoke with a very nice and understanding PA. I love the structure of the clinic. if you take your meds in excess then this is not the doc for you. I wanted to comment on ""DEEVA's"" response by a staff member was very well written, and I thank you for taking the time to explain in detail. <3|Do no harm, Dr's code right? I really liked the place to begin with. They jack up self pay prices and dont post arrival policy in their office like everyone else. By the way you get to get there 15 minutes early at open and wait an hour to an hour and a half, stand crippled in line and usually pain doctors have comfortable chairs for people like me, but I guess lawn chair comfort suffices.
Went during a spine surgery, there was a complication requiring me to go to osu for a growth based off of their opinion, spend 26 hours there for a lance, MRI CAT scan ect. I have some weird growth under the fluid so they made me admit. Still dont know what it is.. Anyhow, i lost my contract in Houston due to collaborating care and finding a new pain dr. I finally have another contract starting Monday 12 hours away, get to the office that requires patients to be 15 minutes early (I was 10 late to UA and refill so maybe 13 minutes of work on their part plus the 2 or 3 minute call in to the pharmacist.
Today was my last day to get in before this 2 day 12 hour drive and the possibility of underperforming again from the pain should it flair up. I offered to wait for a cancellation, wait until after the last patient or do whatever to preserve my wellbeing..nope reschedule..can't reschedule it's a 4 month contract. Well dont know what to tell ya..|The Dr's are WONDERFUL! BUT I have not been able to get through to them, past leaving a message, since February 2, 2017!!!!!! Why won't they answer their phone or call me back? I keep leaving messages. I hurt so bad and can't get in to see them!",2018-09-21|2018-10-24|2018-05-20|2018-01-26|2017-10-20|2019-10-09|2019-10-25|2017-04-21,5|1|5|1|1|4|1|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended",,,comfortable_waiting_area|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJF5gHZe4asocRoQ-tmDGeQbQ,26

They listen, care, they actually want to know how things are and want you to be better. SHOUT OUT TO HALLIE SHE IS THE BEST NURSE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE!!!!!! I have no clue what I would do with out her. She has helped me immensely & I know that it isn't just me that gets this quality of care. I thank God that I found you guys n I am so blessed to be in the care of people who really care about you! Love Dr Mosel & Dr Sharah sorry they're just my faves! Dr. Blick is wonderful too I'm just now getting to know him! Trust & believe that this is a life cha ging experience when it comes to pain management! Xoxox|I've been going here for almost 4 years and I think they are great..I was.diagnosed with crps from a hospital injury. The girls in the front are helpful and very nice. I see Dr Sharrah most the time and I think he is terrific. He listens, he's polite , he also does my injections at the hospital.  I just think him and Dr Mosel are terrific humans and I feel anyone who sees either one will not be disappointed.You guys are terrific and I'm so glad that I have such great Drs close by.|Dr Blick is one of the rudest doctors that I have ever met. He not only is sarcastic but talks down to you. I was wondering why the staff was disappearing. They all QUIT!!!  And when I spoke up to him he let me go as a patient!
P.S. No wonder he doesn't no what the heck he's doing.....he went to medical school in Dominica, West Indies!!!!!!!! I wish I would have know sooner!!!!|My daughter in law goes there and loves him she has had a hard time getting doctors to listen to her and he actually does listen to her concerns about her chronic issues with her back and is always trying to figure out how to best help her, this is the 1st doctor that didn't treat her like it was all in her head|This is a new review after another good experience with these guys just yesterday.  I have chronic pain disorders and because of the very successful procedure of a nerve stimulator for my left knee, I went back for the same treatment for my right one.  Once again I am very pleased with the results. I've never had a bad experience with anyone who works here or any of their other locations.  A specific nurse yesterday was very encouraging and helpful when I needed it.  I was medicated for the procedure so I hope I have her name right.  I'm pretty sure it's Elizabeth and she goes by Bizzy or Busy.|Been going for about a year and so far I am satisfied that the doctors are doing all they can to help. I've never had a problem with my prescriptions as I don't abuse them. I get prescribed a pain med for a month and usually last about 3 months. They get a lot of flack from people who abuse their meds and keep wanting more and more and the doc can't and shouldn't accommodate them. We've tried injections in my back and hip. Sometimes they really help, and sometimes not very much. I don't blame the doc, backs are hard to treat it seems. Overall, I've gotten some relief and that is huge for me. For a few years I just existed and constantly in overbearing pain. They have given me much of my regular life back. I appreciate the care I receive from Dr. Blick and asscociates.|This doctor office is not accommodating. They make policy but only enforce them to make things better for themselves. They don't help with the pain. Staff isn't rude but they are not very nice either. I wouldn't recommend this clinic.|Joke.. all they care bout is collecting Ins. Money, Stabbing you with drugs that don't work, Scribing Meds. that don't work instead of fixing problem. Don't return or take your calls when too crippled to make it into your appt. then try to bill you for no show. Make up charges that Ins. & Medicade won't cover then drop you when after refuse to pay after 7-10 yrs of trusting them an want to get better & want 2nd Real Dr. opinion. Finally got to Neuro. Dr., found I had 2 more herniated disc., said he's had same complaints thru his patients said this should have been taken care of instead of shooting drugs into it to knumbing it till next treatment.
Also their billing department are idiots, no way someone with 2 Ins. should owe for & be billed for piss test 2-3 different fee's & NO SHOWS after 6 yrs ago & stopped seeing after Ins. even refused & called outrageous charges. They're crooks & wouldn't trust them with a dieing rat. Also, been fixed & off all pain meds. for over a year.

But understand unfortunately the Doctors has stupid physicians assistant's there as well. These people would rather cover their a$$ than treat you for pain! I only went there for 5 months and my pain was getting worse and they didn't seem to care. The ladies at the front dest are awesome and extremely nice but the care you can find better places than them. I hate giving UA's every month just to get some pills that don't even kill the pain. Thanks for nothing Precision Pain management.|After being treated like I was ""seeking pain pills"" by my referring provider, it was incredibly refreshing to have a provider who understood that I was only seeking pain control, not ""pain pills"". This office is fully staffed by some of the most professional and compassionate healthcare workers I've dealt with in a very long time. They care about managing your symptoms while you work with other doctors and specialists to help find and treat the cause of your pain, which is the most important thing for me. Couldn't be happier with the care I'm continuing to receive.|My friend calapsed at their office and ended up in hospital now cannot get their meds the staff is very un fair to their patient.|My wife has been coming here for years and we were heartbroken to hear that Dr. Adkins was no longer there.  It would have been nice to know that before her appointment since she was supposed to discuss her change in medicine with him and instead got a PA. Jay a nurse was so awesome to help to get my wife rescheduled for her appointment.  My wife had gotten an infection from a surgery, and was in the ICU for 2 weeks which made her miss her appointment, and he remembered seeing the wounds that were infected and so was very sympathetic to the situation and told me to let him know once she got out of the hospital and he would get her back in to the schedule.  They have been so helpful during this stressful time...THANKS EVERYONE!|I don't like discrimination I didn't like how they handled their business I didn't like how they treated me as a patient how they singled me out how they judged me and how judgmental their staff is. I don't think people have a right to discriminate people for wanting to get better and I think they used the other medicine for another excuse. The medicine that I was on and was supposed to help me what a sad sad thing to do to somebody who's has such chronic pain from nine and half years and longer and a cancer patient who's trying to survive and trying to take care of a 94-year-old mother what a sad sad bunch of people that discriminate against a human being.

Ive struggle with chronic pain for 14 years but I'm still younger. I guess young people can't be in pain. We concluded that it's not migraines yet he insists it is. I was on pain meds but my insurance changed so I couldn't see him. Came back with good insurance again and was refused the same care I had previously received. Doesn't matter your history you are drug seeking if you don't agree with them. Found a better Dr. that actually ordered MRIs to find bulging damaged discs, pressure on my spinal cord and had no curve in my neck due to an injury. So NO I was not drug seeking and a pain management Dr. didn't want to provide care for a patient. Find a different specialty Mackey, your heart is not in the right place. Maybe take more time and order tests before providing meds so you could see the reasons for the pain.

*I left this review 4 years ago, and had my 10 year anniversary with Dr Mackey and his staff.  I can still say, confidently, that they're an amazing medical practice.

It is truly helpful and reassuring knowing that whether a person is managing chronic pain, post-surgical pain, or both simultaneously, they are there to help you get through it in the best, and safest way for you as an individual. If anyone needs a place with excellent care, and is willing to put in the effort outside the office to help with what you can control (good nutrition, gentle exercise, good sleep habits and positive thinking), I believe that together as a team, a successful plan can be achieved.

I did find out that when the move took place comprehensive gained something like 600 new patients so the rushing I understand, but Hannah always makes you feel like when you are in with her you are her one and only patient.  I might be a little impartial because if it were not for Hannah I might not be here today.  I had a surgery go bad about a year ago and she pointed out that I needed to go back to the surgeon and make them see me and when I went it turned out that I had an infection in my gut that had gone septic.  The day I found out that Dr. Drabek was retiring, I was sad but when she asked me if I wanted to follow her I never had to think about that.  She was concerned if I would drive to Edmond, that didn't change my mind.  When I find excellent doctors I will stay with them even if I had to drive a little farther because a good doctor can be easy to find but an excellent doctor is hard to find.|I had one of the worst experiences ever with this place.. I noticed in their pre registration paperwork it mentioned in 3 or 4 places about patients being rude to doctor nillson and staff threatening immediate dismissal. In reality. Deborah nillson was the most unprofessional, hateful, rude, disrespectful so called doctor I've ever seen.  The first visit I sat there in my wheelchair and took it, the second visit 3-5 minutes in it she started her behavior again. I told her the disrespect stops now she said you can leave an find another pain Doctor, at that point I proceeded to leave she was yelling obscenities across the office at me and telling her staffing i wouldn't be coming back.

This great Dr.has helped me more than all the years of others before. He continues to come up with new technology to help me with my pain. His office and his faithful and compassionate staff are an extention of our family.  I wish I've could give a 10 for excellence.|If I could I would give them a 10 star review! I have been going to Dr Wasif approximately 3 years now. I receive the shots,  in my back which for me has been working! Here's a five star to Michell front desk, ( forgive me if I spelt your name wrong) I was suppose to pick up my medication but when I got there they were out of stock and every pharmacy within a fifteen mile radius. So of course I was not happy with that. I left a message for Dr Wasif and staff on Sunday night. Monday morning first thing Michell called me and was so nice and completely understood my stress and was apologetic about what had happen, which was out of her hands in the first place but she really cares and I could tell with her kind words and reassurance! Dr Wasif went above and beyond to get my medication I needed and I  got it in my hand by 2p.m. today Monday. He was busy with other patients but took a moment to help with my situation on his lunch time!!Today I was able to get them even though I had to drive 30 minutes each way he HELPED me! If you're looking for a place where you can get relief from your pain! He has a lot of options and he diligently will work with you to give you your Life back! Dr Wasif and Michell and staff are hands down the best pain relief place in all of Tulsa and in all of Oklahoma!! I've tried a couple before I found Dr wasif... one more thing when you go in to do your procedure back, neck, knees, etc he and staff makes you feel like family and does not just rush you through he talks to you and helps you not to be so nervous about the shots at least to me!!! I will always recommend them!!! Thank you Dr Wasif and Michell!!! Now I'm getting back to work!!!!|First visit today~ I'm super excited to start treatments with Dr Wasif what a great guy, in a league of his own. He also really takes the time to educate you and offer real options. Looking forward to feeling better the 29th ;)|I have been a patient of Dr. Wasif since April 2022 after my previous pain mgt doctor retired.  Dr. Wasif has done wonders in treating my chronic pain in a short time.  The medications he prescribes are spot on & the epidurals help a lot. He is very personable & is a very innovative doctor.  I am blessed to have found him & highly recommend him.  His office staff are great also.|I have been to 7 Neurologist since moving to Oklahoma!  I have been on every medication and other forms of Injections, inhalers, Botox, Nerve blocking and physical therapy! And chiropractor.

I suffer from all forms of migraines, and the last three years chronic neck and back of head pain.   He has been great, I would recommend him to anyone.  As I find I am not curable, but he is trying to make me more pain comfortable.

Unlike some of the pain specialists I've seen in the past, Dr Kelly takes the time to listen to me.  I don't feel like I am just a number.  The rest of his staff is great as well.  Anytime I send them a message, they respond very quickly.|I had my first visit at Oklahoma Pain Center this week! Unfortunately, I have been run through the mill when it comes to finding a good doctor. If you live in chronic pain, you know the anxiety of finding not only a doctor to treat you but to CARE. I am from Texas and have been having trouble finding a new pain management specialist here in OK. Right out of the gate, the staff was so warm and inviting. Definition of ""Southern Hospitality"" . I'm sure they knew I was nervous, but they couldn't have made me me feel more comfortable. Vivian specifically, went above and beyond for me. Just by getting to talk with her for a few minutes, I knew I wasn't anyone special, she just has a God given gift to make each customer she encounters feel like you've known each other your whole life!

When I met Dr. Blake Kelly, he was VERY black and white with me. Which as a patient, I appreciated because most doctors will just say anything to get you out and their next patient in. Dr. Kelly spent 2 hours with me listening to my story and doing his best trying to educate and guide me!

As a younger new patient, I have a little homework I have to do to HOPEFULLY get the relief I am looking for. However, I dont mind the homework at all knowing that I have a doctor that is willing to run behind the entire rest of his day to make sure I am feeling supported. The last time I had a doctor like that was in 2016 and I didn't think I would ever find another one.

I dont know what my future holds at OPC, but I can say that if I end up not getting the treatment I am seeking, it wont be because the doctor just doesnt care or didnt listen to me! In the meantime, I look forward to my future visits here and am so grateful for the hope that they gave me. I am going to hold on to it for as long as I can!

STRONGLY recommend Dr. Kelly Blake and his entire staff!|Dr. Kelly has been treating my wife for a few years now with a mystery condition that has felt like an episode of House. Over the last year she has been on a real downhill slide medically. He has been the rock to keep her going. Her other doctors care, so I don't want to downplay that, but are so busy they just honestly don't have the time for all the issues and day-to-day changes. Despite her high-needs Dr. Kelly has never left her to suffer and always pivots and adjusts medications to meet her needs. Most importantly he has never treated her like an inconvenience. His office staff is just as caring and Heather specifically has gone out of her way to help her.|Well managed chronic pain makes normal human functioning possible.  Without it, one is rendered unproductive, discouraged, and even hopeless.  Thank God for Dr. Kelly whose excellent pain management skills are only superseded by his genuine care for his patients.|The doctor and staff are very professional and caring. All my pain issues were addressed and taken seriously. As a new patient they were very thorough. Dr. Kelly listened and made himself available during the first week to answer my questions. I am doing better than I have in years thanks to him. I would recommend him to anyone needing relief from chronic pain.|I had to wait almost a month, than had to contact them for any information. At that time the receptionist inform me I needed to make another appointment with my referring physician pending further contact with Dr. Kelly, I was told that the phone call from them would be from a unknown number and not to miss it. I was relieved to have them contact me that same day. Upon receiving phone call it turned into a humiliating and degrading experience. I was informed they did a background check and criminal record, I did not consent to this as I was never informed of this process. I made poor choices over 8 years ago but I have since completed probation and paid any due fines. There has been no legal trouble since than. I have been in pain management for 6 months due to multiple surgeries resulting in a negligent driver hitting me. I do not abuse my medication, I never got to meet with Dr. Kelly, but due to this treatment I received in this phone call I highly recommend seeing another doctor. The lady was rude and condescending.|Dr Kelly made a great first impression. He listened and took his time explaining everything to me. He seemed very caring and like he truly wants to help his patients. I feel like he is looking out for what's best for me, and how to help me reach that goal. I appreciate the time he spent starting a plan. I feel encouraged. Thank you Dr Kelly!|I've been taking my elderly mother to Dr. Kelly now for at least a couple of years and Dr. Kelly and his staff have been outstanding!

Note the clinic is kept clean and sanitary.
When I was a new patient the staff became familiar with my medical records.
Dr. Baird was able to work around my needs to assess me.
When I needed an update to my spinal cord stimulator again Dr. Baird and his team were on top of the situation.
I very much enjoy the hometown feel of the clinic. Yet knowing if I need anything they are on top of it.
Oh and the staff will help, should an appointment need changed.
Also, I would add the main switchboard and office have been able to access my records in a tick and assist me with last minute issues. No frustration just a cheerful staff.
You'll find the main office, in Tulsa

Thank you Dr.Baird & Staff for giving me a pleasant experience with caring individuals over the years. Deb Carlton|This clinic has been the biggest blessing. I ultimately came here because my doctor moved out of state with little to no-notice. I was so stressed out then, but in hindsight, it was the best thing that could've happened. I say that because the doctors I've worked with here have always gone above and beyond. If they are unsure on something, they'll consult other doctors and do extensive research. I have a complicated medical history. I wasn't supposed to live past my 17th birthday. I had a Make A Wish as a kid and several surgeries. Thankfully, due those surgeries, I am still alive & I'm able to live a productive & meaningful life. The doctors at this clinic have helped me so much. I had the honor of having Savannah Doughty as my doctor for a couple years. She worked so diligently for me & helped guide me through a pregnancy. Now I work with Kamile & she has been great. I can't say enough how great this clinic has been.|They are always polite and will listen to what you are going through and help find solutions for your pain.

During first consultation she was interested in me, not in a rush,
reviewed my MRI and expressed her concerns.
Dr White was very compassionate about my symptoms.
I have had multiple back injections in the past from others, but Dr White's procedure seems to have longer lasting results. Very pleased|I have been seeing Dr Traci White since 2013 and I have found her to be professional, knowledgeable and compassionate. I believe she has done everything she can to relieve my pain. I am so much more mobile and independent than I was when I first started with Dr White. Her and her staff have truly made my life better and easier. I have always highly recommended her and will continue to do so.|Do not use this facility. I was referred here for a spinal steroid injection which I have had multiple times at another facility back in Texas. I experienced multiple issues.
1- They experienced a ""glitch"" in scheduling and it took 3 weeks after receiving the request from my surgeon to actually let me discuss scheduling the shot. They did apologize for this error.
2- At the time of the injection I could tell this wasn't normal and I let them know the pain was much worse and they could not care less.
3- I called in the next day and had to call 4 times before someone would actually speak to me instead of trying to pass me off. The doctor did call me back but didn't address pain concerns, just the allergic reaction to the medication I had been given
4- 1 week later I am still unable to hold my newborn or rock him due to the pain these people caused and they are not interested in having me come in for pain management they instructed me to visit the local ER instead.

I would highly suggest finding another facility as these people do not care if they cause you pain and will do nothing to help relieve it.|My daughter has serve physical and mental disabilities and was needing injection for her back pain.  I have seen some reviews about Dr White and staff not being pleasant or having a good bed side manner and I can say I had the complete opposite experience. My daughter has a true phobia of needles and the staff was beyond understanding an patient with her.  They not only took care of her and took the extra time needed they took care of my wife and myself as well.  They were kind, informative, and understanding.  They adapted their approach to accommodate my daughter specific needs.  Every person we talked to was this way.  My interactions with Dr White and her staff is amazing and I feel blessed to have them care for my daughter.|I made an attempt to get scheduled with Traci White, MD for a cervical neck injection following a 4 day hospitalization for pain control. Her office did not call me back after 3 days of leaving messages. I drove to the office and was told the phone lines were down and  I needed a referral. I obtained the referral and had to call several times to get scheduled. Spoke with Serena who said they had me scheduled but it was for the wrong area and wrong procedure. The referral was resent  and again could not get through to the office. Once I did get through the call was given to Serena who told me I was scheduled on Thursday and would be getting a call with the time. Did not receive the call , left several messages. Finally I got through to the front office and they gave the call to Serena who was very rude, raised her voice with me (I never raised my voice with her) she told me they didn't take my insurance which had already been confirmed that they did and when challenged on that she hung up. I called back and left a message for the practice manager after confirming with my insurance company that they are in network and that NO requests for insurance authorization or confirmation had been attempted by this office. The practice manager never returned my call.  I work in healthcare and this is absolutely unacceptable. The physician herself may be skilled but it takes a team to care for a patient.

respectful & loving treatment|The Tulsa staff is awesome! They are easy to talk to and take the time to get to know you, have not encountered anyone that was rude or disrespectful to anyone. Staff seem to truly care and usually greet you by name when you come in. Would recommend for anyone. Tori, Chase, Kara, and Savanna are great at what they do and take the time to visit with you.|Very professional and extremely kind. They make you feel like family here.

The staff. Tori and Chase are super friendly and care about their patients.
Having said that I am not impressed so much with the diagnostics.  They waited until I was 16 treatments into the program to agree that the problem is in my back, not my feet. I got a different answer from every provider  until I got Spencer.  He put me on back treatments. We will see how they work out.|Since I started coming here a few weeks ago, I have noticed a significant difference. Before I came in, I was afraid to move my toes or sit for too long, but now I am not. I was skeptical abut the shots that I was told that I was going to be getting twice a week, but now that I know how well they are working for me, I lok forward to them... kinda. But overall, the clinic is very clean and organized, the staff is friendly and make me feel heard. So I am happy that I came here and look forward to feeling better.|The over all experience has been very positive. Other wise I would not have came back as I drive almost 3 hours. However, I had an unpleasant experience with scheduling. I was trying to schedule my appointments back to back because I drive so far. I couldn't make what was scheduled for me but when I told Kennedy that, I was told the schedule was non changing, and if I could not make an appointment we would just cancel.I am leaving the end of September and I want to finish my appointments before I leave so that was not acceptable to me I was also told that the schedule would no change. I was so upset that I went to the front and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. While I was waiting Megan came up to me and asked if she could help me. I explained the situation to her and she started to see what she could do about my schedule. She made me a brand new schedule which worked for me and I was happy. However, I felt that Kennedy was very rude and it was her way only that she had scheduled and I had no say so at all. I did not like that feeling, and it is not a positive effect that I am sure your clinic is trying to have.|The staff in Tulsa are awesome; caring, efficient and concerned with your condition.

So glad I was!  I inaccurately thought ""pain management"" clinics were just focused on refilling opioids. Instead, I received targeted treatments to reduce pain that I never knew were available. I have a lot of confidence in Dr. Martucci and his team. Thank you for helping me regain movement with less pain!|Very dependable and caring.
I have been living with back pain for years. I can't imagine how miserable I would be without a skilled and truly compassionate doctor and staff helping me along. Sadly, there is no magic wand to eliminate my pain or anything that can take me back to the day before my injury.
I am grateful for Dr Martucci's commitment to patient care in spite of the limitations of insurance.  I am grateful for this practice and encourage you if you are not a patient but are searching for a doctor this is a really dependable place if you're serious about your own care.|First, do not get me wrong.  I love Dr. Martucci.  I believe he truly cares about your pain.  I was in for a procedure, but had a question about a most recent MRI.  He did not have to look at it at the time, but he did glance at it. He mention that there are some different  tactics that we can use.my dissatisfaction came with my discharge.   I am a LONG time patient at Tulsa Pain, and I, myself, had had no major issues.  However, all three of my drivers have, and I figured it was time to say something because I know for a fact, I was in no shape to leave yet, but I was made to.  I am extremely upset about this last visit.  I tried calling the office, but got nowhere.  Maybe if the right person sees my post, I can get some answers.|I had my last procedure with them on 2/13/24
There's a reason it's my last appointment. If they want to allow the patient to continue to have pain, because insurance guidelines require time between injections, and the office staff informed me the doctor will not see me until insurance pays again.....
Why not do a better job during the injection so there isn't any pain.
Instead they cut back on the amount of medicine being injected.
I know because I feel it as it goes into my tissue!!!
Dr revalis wasn't very easy without sedation but I walked out minutes afterwards and had zero pain.
Now dr martucci is a nice enough man for sure.
But he doesn't do the job up to the standards they used to have there before the split!
If you're having pain I recommend staying away from here.
Good luck to you|We've been with this office a very long time. They are able to provide services our local clinics cannot do as an ""all-in-one"" service. However, they seem to have entirely too many patients crunched into too little of time. These appointments always take all day, doesn't matter if we schedule early in the morning or early afternoon, it's still an all day ordeal. The last visit was probably the worst (even though they've progressively gotten worse), we showed up early, they took awhile to call him back, when it was his time, they blew his vein and didn't fix it. They decided to go ahead with the procedure which he should've been asleep for but wasn't and felt the entire thing. I call this a fail, a huge one. I've called around to see if a closer to home option was available but unfortunately, nobody offers all the same services. This is completely devastating considering these treatments are needed for back degeneration relief. And to top it off, his prescription wasn't even called in. It just seems their services have gone downhill as their practice grows. There is a lack of care missing.|Don't waste your time the staff doesn't care don't want to help you said if you don't like then don't come

Had the time to call me and harassed me for leaving review but didn't have the time to help me|Took my friend here for a procedure that she needed a driver for. MOST of the people were very nice. BUT, Amanda W was a complete b*t*h to us from the minute she called us back. I could hear her talking to other patients and she was completely nice to them all. So why is? We done absolutely nothing to deserve that treatment. I heard her asking othe pts if they got relief from their last procedure and how much it helped. My friend was asked zero questions about her last procedure. She just threw an IPad in her face and said initial and sign her. My friend and I both work in Dr.'s offices and I can guarantee no pt in the office I work in would ever be treated the way we were treated here. And if one of us were ever that rude to a pt we would be fired on the spot. I would never use this office for anything. And I will voice my opinion to the Dr.'s I work for so maybe they will reconsider where our referrals are sent.

It's sad that one person can ruin a first impression like that.|I have been a patient here for 5 years they have always treated me great always willing to help and truly concerned for me. I have nothing but great things to say about everyone that works here. Dr. Korbe is so smart, caring, and truly wants to help me as safely as possible. That's saying a lot because I have a lot of compounding medical issues that makes it hard to manage them all and still try to get me pain relief as well as following the ever so changing laws but he does it. I think most doctors would have given up on me by now but he is still trying to help me and I will never be able to thank him enough.

Then when I called and asked if I could speak with them about an increase because the pain was so bad I wanted to die.. they dismissed me from the clinic and called the police on me. They said that my MRI had nothing on it when they dismissed me and then called me back to tell me they did find something but there's nothing they could do for me. Don't waste your time or your money on this doctors office. The staff is rude and has no respect for people. They will treat you like a liar if you are suffering from pain they cannot see. Also, the whole place is decorated like a church and they constantly play Christian music, very ironic for a clinic that treats their patients like drug seekers even when they told you they didn't want any pills.|Buddy you are unprofessional you and your whole staff  your staff told me you could see me every 3 months then your nurse comes out and says the opposite you have wasted my time.

All of the PA's I've seen have been so kind & very personable. They don't rush you and they actually listen to you. Amanda Barritt is one of the very best. They have experience working with complex pain issues, I have a rare connective tissue disorder that can wreak havoc on my body & causes a lot of other issues that all stem from the disease. It can put me in significant pain, especially if everything flares up at once. Everyone from the check-in staff/reception, office manager, the nurses (I love Jodi!) PA's, & Dr. Cramer have been very kind to me and have treated me with nothing but compassion and care. If you are worried because of the negative reviews others have left- don't listen to them. I usually read reviews before meeting with a new doctor. I have to see a few specialists because of my rare complex condition. I know how scary and difficult it can be sometimes to find someone who will listen. They really do. I believe I've been with them for about a year now. They went above and beyond for me. I had an appointment on the anniversary of my fathers passing and one of the nurses gave me some really heartfelt advice that meant so much to me. These are really good people who work here. Don't let the negative reviews fool you.|I'm just baffled about the reviews I'm reading. The office is nice and clean. The reception area was nothing but kind. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Jessica, the PA, was so thorough and listened to everything I said. She did a complete assessment and offered more insight into where my pain is originating from than most doctors. They obtained all of my records before my appointment and all I had to bring was my ID and insurance. They are comprehensive with their treatment. Not just throwing pills at people. Really trying to make your quality of life better.|I was referred by my neurosurgeon for epidural injections. I was told today my appointment was at 11:45 got there just to be told my appointment was at 12:45 and they tell patients to arrive 1 hour early for paperwork. After finishing my paperwork in less than 10 min while sitting in the waiting room, another patient walked in who was scheduled next week and was told they had time to do a walk in today and he was taken back before I was.

When I refused injections the problems began with their willingness to help.

When I found a better doctor and switched offices they filed a lawsuit against me claiming I owed them thousands. I had insurance the entire time I was seeing them. Their lawsuit claimed I owed them $10k+, that's extortion.

The injections that many pain clinics offer are designed to be given 1-2 times a year, not monthly. Any clinic giving monthly nerve block injections are over using this medicine. Uncommon side effects are more the norm when drug guidelines are ignored by doctors.

It's sad how predatory medical clinics become when someone recovering from a near death experience owes them $100 and cannot pay because they didn't have a job and couldn't walk or stand unassisted.

Avoid these predators unless you're looking for a legal pill pusher and are willing to let them bleed your health insurance company on monthly unnecessary injection expenses.

The owners got booted from their last clinic for shady practices. The DEA should shut this place/person down.|Caring, actually trying to find a way to fix  this situation.   Both Dr.Brandon and Dr. Do are very knowledgeable about pain and options that that remedy my pain.  They don't just run me through the check list  and then they can't do anything more.
Their support staff also great.  They make feel comfortable about doctors and the plans that are being laid out.  John and Joel are easy to talk to and they update my file about everything I need to talk to Dr about.  Thanks for everything! 10 is my score:)

I have been caring for my 95 year old cancer patient father for the past year and half. We've been to multiple hospital ers, attended over 50 doctors appointments and traveled out of state for second opinions. Never have we experienced this level of inefficiency.

We arrived at 9am. We were the only patient in the waiting room. At 10:15 we left. The nurse informed us the doctor would still need an additional 20 mins before he could see us. My father could no longer sit comfortably so we excused ourselves from the room.

I only wish I had read the other reviews before coming. We, like many of you were being referred here by an orthopedics office for a spine injection. If you find yourself in a similar circumstance, I would strongly urge you to select a clinic that has some measure of respect for your time.|The Dr is very rude and has HORRIBLE bed side manners.

I was first referred to Dr Stidham by McBride Clinic because I had back problems and needed a hip in 2018.  I couldn't walk.

Was evaluated in the first visit and offered a steroid injection, which we did.  A few days later, tried to call/email to talk to staff about other options since I still had immense pain.  No response, nothing from them for two days. After no response, I finally had to call to discussion other options and the woman who answered was not friendly at all!  Told me that they would NOT be giving me any pain pills, to which I told her I NEVER ASKED FOR ANY!  Didn't like how she treated me, no follow-up.  Won't be wasting my time with a clinic who doesn't return calls to patients and treats them like they are drug seeking.

A little more than 50 years ago, I sustained a major spine injury that initially left me totally paralyzed from the waist down. Since that time, I have dealt with intermittent leg pains varying from mild to excruciating. My first appointment with Dr Gordon was on June 20 of this year. Even on that visit, I felt like he was not really interested in my situation. His first and immediate action, without any discussion with me, was to cut my pain medication! I was recently told that another cut is in the works, again no consultation with me! Meanwhile my sleep pattern has substantially deteriorated and my depression level has skyrocketed. I feel that he has HIS agenda and that the patient (me) is mostly irrelevant.|Saw Dr. Gordon for chronic back pain that has been panging me for almost two years now and have yet to get any relief from anyone else. He has been the first doctor to properly take a serious look at my issues and may have finally provided me a actual diagnosis of my problem. He has put together a plan to try and tackle my issues and it remains to be seen if it will work, but his friendly bedside manner and willingness to work with me is much further than I've gotten with any other doctor and provides me with a measure of confidence that I might be able to put this pain behind me in the near future. Would recommend paying Dr. Gordon and his staff a visit if you also suffer from chronic pain issues.|Was a patient. When I was asked about about other pain medication I was honest. When asked to take drug test I specifically stated it would be positive the Dr. Says, "" this is just a baseline, but no more in the next ones"". The following day I was no longer given pain medication and it was put into my medical records so that no Dr in the DRH community will help me.|Just the worst get referred to him for neck back and hips but say he only wants to work two issues at a time put me on meds that cause seizures and doesn't keep his own appointments an his nurse staff lies an cancelled your appointment an says they told you and then doesn't even check your file to see if the meds they prescribe will conflict with health issues complete waste of my insurance||",2024-12-11|2024-11-05|2024-09-27|2023-10-02|2024-08-22|2024-02-09,1|5|1|2|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ5fr3Q_hDrYcR2SoZAz3jOUA,6

The Staff is amazingly knowledgeable and helpful as well, and my life is changing because I no longer feel like I'm birthing a chain saw out of my back for the most part. I have extremely rare diseases so I'm aged twice as what I really am, I have severe disc problems from lifting & moving things I shouldn't have but was forced to for my entire life, compounded by extreme sensitivity to pain and environment, and having EDS, so I'm literally falling apart, and gravity is often times stronger than the muscle strength I have to move my body or appendages.

Yes, this is confirmed by X-Ray, and I'm disabled and had to prove everything to endless lines of govt. professionals. I'm unlike most people who are the worst, I'm the worst of the worst and am lucky to have my body not give out yet like what happens to most males with my genetic, incurable diseases that have rendered my body useless and in pain that needs 24/7 treatment.

My last Doctor from a DIFFERENT CLINIC wouldn't give me needed referrals and literally said, ""NO"", when I asked. OK Spine has an entire suite of pain nullifying options, and after I just reviewed their website, I'm EXTREMELY excited to see remedies and trial procedures involving nerves and electrolysis.

I cannot stand needles nor the pain they cause, it's overwhelming, but I am signing up for every needle nerve procedure they have because I fully believe they can help me in the long run with the options they have.

They also offer options for pain during these procedures, which is wonderful news because needles cause me extreme pain. I am no longer afraid of needle procedures after reading what they offer, and I know this can be life changing and a wonderful experiment for them to see if the procedures can help me from feeling like I crawl out of a plane wreck without medications. I cannot wait to get needled for the first time ever!!

As for their professionalism, it's top notch, and you'd better be able to prove your needing of their services because everything is highly regulated and scrutinized, exactly as it should be. I completely put my life in their hands, and they are saving it, because I'm not stuck in bed crying everyday, and nobody has screamed at me for asking about a mobile assistance personal device like my first doctor at a different clinic did.

I was told by my EDS doctor I will be on pain management for my entire life, which I never thought nor considered this to be an option, I thought I had to live with pain for my whole life, I didn't know about this treatment; I didn't know pain could be blocked, so it's life changing, and the last two clinics and their treatment plans were non effective, traumatizing and the ""doctors"" had what seems to be narcissistic type egos.

This is NOT the case with the professional Dr. Claflin, whose bedside manner is an 11 on a 1-10 scale!! OK Spine with Dr. Claflin is where I should have been from day one. I highly recommend OK Spine if your current life means you can't have a life because of pain nobody should ever have to endure. It's simply not fair, debilitating and the scariest thing I've ever encountered in my life.

Dr. Claflin, his wonderful Staff and Oklahoma International Spine and Pain has completely removed all fears and all pain, and they have options for permanent treatment that other places do not offer. I am in the best hands medically ever, and I'm truly thankful, I'm no longer confined to bed or break down in tears everyday! Thank You So Very Much, Sincerely, CB.|I received ketamine infusions here from my lifetime major depressive disorder they have been life changing. It has worked better than any therapy or medication I have taken prior. Lavona the nurse anesthesiologist that administers the infusions is absolutely wonderful and I have the utmost trust in her professionalism is top notch and she is a kind compassionate caring woman . I would have given five stars if it were not for the woman at the front desk she is rude condescending and dismissive .|I wasn't dropped as a patient here but I chose to leave after a year of what was a wonderful experience with Dr Halsell. I was seeing him for Suboxone and doing great with my recovery I passed every UA and had no problems until today when I was 15 minutes late for my appointment coming back from my grandfather's funeral. I told them ahead of time I was going to be late and you would have thought the world was ending. Dr Halsell is often not there and has had to reschedule me around his life many times but if I do that once it's a huge problem. They said this isn't the first time I've had scheduling problems but I've only had to reschedule one time before in the whole year I've been there. I finally got there and because I was taking too long to pee (a whole 5-10 minutes) they wouldn't see me or let me wait to try again. A whole year of progress down the drain. It's too bad because I loved Dr Halsell himself hes a really cool guy and I would have hoped our relationship and my recovery were more important to him than to deny me one time for being 15 min late and not peeing fast enough but it is what it is I guess, I'm just a number to him for insurance billing. So I'm going to taper off what I have left I guess and stay sober for myself without help. Just disappointed, I didn't deserve that disrespect. They have no idea what mountains I had to move to drive 3 hrs through strong storms and hazardous roads straight from the funeral and miss the last half just to make it there, only to be rejected and scolded like a child by someone half my age for not peeing fast enough.|I had been seeing Dr Halsell for a few years and started having my UA's come back with FALSE positives for meth (I believe it's obvious when a person is on that stuff anyway) but like I said every time they sent it off it came back as FALSE but because I couldn't come in for the third time in a month he dismissed me. I'm a mom of four who Homeschool's my children my husband is gone approx. 9 months a year and it is hard for me to drive over an hour one way three times in 1 month. This facility does not care about their patients or he would have taken the time to help me figure out why my UA's were doing this, not just dismiss me halfway through the month with no warning.|Terrible service.  After 3 reschedules (due to my travel schedule and the fact that Dr. Halsell is only in the Tulsa office the 1-15th of each month, I'm in town later in the month), they refused to accept me as a first time patient. Avoid this doctor/provider at all costs, they're not interested in helping patients. Period. I'll be posting a formal complaint with the state board of Medicine.|My back has never been the same since one appointment here.

I have been seeing these kinds of doctors since my first of two back surgeries in 2014 as well as three ACL surgeries in between. Dr Wright is by far the best there is.|Dr. Wright is an honest, amazing doctor who really tries to help by using not just traditional methods but also cutting edge, new techniques. After years of lower back pain  and 3 herniated disc's, I was referred to Dr. WRIGHT. After reviewing my history, he suggested Amniotic fluid injections to actually CURE my discs.....all other doctors had said healing a disc was impossible, I needed surgery. Within 8 weeks of the injections, my pain has been reduced from a 9 (laying flat on my back not moving)  to about  a manageable 4 (I am returning to work after 3 years!!) Don't expect immediate results with this procedure. It does take time for your body to heal but this is the only thing that has worked for me and offers the possibility of actually healing herniated discs over time.

Dr. Wright and his staff understand financial concerns and are more than willing to work with your insurance company and you to get the new technologies approved and paid for by the insurance company.

They really care about helping you..... Other doctors could learn a few lessons from Dr Wright and his staff!|Dr Wright is an amazing doctor. On my first visit I was chatting with another patient and she told me she drove all the way from Ft Worth to see him. I thought then that he must me great. I was not disappointed. The tests he ran and the procedures he did just to find out my problem. When he discovered my problem needed a different type of doctor he referred me to the perfect doctor that is amazing.

These have to be new nurses that need some guidance on how to deal with their customers/patients.|Very unfortunate to have people in the Medical field that have no heart for those patients in need. Andy had us talking to the office for a whole month before being told that my husband was not accepted by Dr. Fraley. Why not let us know the first week or two? After that month they referred us to another clinic and Dr Fraleys office didn't even have the medical records you thought would have been obtained after a whole month. People don't understand that time is valuable and patients are hurting and need care. Hoping God can open people's eyes and hearts to care for others and be reminded why they chose the medical field to begin with.|I have a whole host of doctors due to severe rheumatoid arthritis and have never left a negative review until now. I fired this doctor because when it came time to renew my medication I called three days in a row to have the prescription renewed before I finally got a response. Her staff responded every single day, but the doctor failed to call the prescription in. When she finally did call the prescription in she miscoded it and it could not be filled. I called them back, advised them of the problem and the doctor advised that I should wait until my appointment the next day. I was  then 3 days past due to get my prescription filled and I was beginning to go through withdrawal symptoms. During my office visit that day the PA admitted that a big mistake had been made and was very sorry for the trouble and promised to have my prescription filled that day, it did not happen.  I called the after hours number to have Dr Fraley paged and left a message that the prescription needed to be filled, it was a Friday afternoon and no one ever called me back. That Saturday the prescription was finally called in. Unfortunately, my pharmacy didn't have the correct strength of medicine and paged Dr. Fraley to have her call the medicine to another pharmacy. She never called them back. I am now five days overdue for my medicine through no fault of my own. Dr Fraley is SO FIRED and is, by far, the WORST doctor I've ever encountered!|I, as a retired physician myself never denigrate doctors, but  Fraley cares much more about what ""might"" happen than the actual well being of her patients. I take my ill mother who has excruciating pain. And Dr Fraley does NOT care about quality of life. Here is a direct quote ""No matter what happens, it will come back to her being on opiates"". When asked if she cared about quality of life, she said ""I am not going to argue about this"".
So if you or someone you love has pain, I mean real pain, do NOT use this physician. She does NOT care. She would rather you or your family member die in pain.

I have only been twice now, But I'm very pleased with my experience and that of his staff! I'm still recovering from a Spinal Fusion I had done on April 18, 2018 of this year! I currently had a set of injection last week which have never helped much. I get to go Next week and have my nerves burned in my back so I'm hoping for some relief as I'm still under the care of my Nerosurgen also at this time! Thanks for being understanding caring and compassionate towards me!|I am guardian of my adult daughter who had a stroke 3 years ago. Our last pain doc's office never shared any alternative's to her pain, only narcotics, then acted angry when we'd get script re-fills. The office turn-over was tremendous, 1 of the docs claimed she'd never heard of CBD oil, &amp; they did not like continuing her pain treatment after her neck surgery, which I am told was customary. They dropped us without notice; left my daughter high &amp; dry. The St. John's Pain referral was a lady who was just nuts!! So when we met Dr. Hackal, it was so refreshing to meet someone who was well-informed, had options, really compassionately listened to my daughter, &amp; had an immediate plan in place for her low back pain. No one would treat it or they had sub-standard ideas on how to. This office runs so smoothly; professionally. We did not have to wait long either! Dr. Hackl is the best ever!!|I have been a patient of Dr Hackl now for about 9 months I believe and I am  % surprised by the actual attention paid to me . I've been searching for help many years now just to be heard! And He Hears my Heart. That's not easy to say due to past issues that destroyed my life. I went through hell and back over the years and swore never to trust man again. But after praying for the right help, God pointed me in his direction. I am eternally grateful. The staff is not just courteous, but they all go out of their way to assist in my treatment. I'm finally starting the healing in my opinion. Physically and mentally. Thank you so very much. And may God continue to bless the hands you work with!Rachell, The voice of ONE crying in the wilderness!|Dr Hackl is wonderful! He is caring &amp; conscientious; however, he's very busy &amp; difficult to see. Been with him for 7+ yrs; followed from previous office. Haven't had consistency seeing rest of the staff so I can't comment on them yet.|Fired me after i asked to be REDUCED from opiods as they were making me sick. The pc refused and walked out of office. Have been rude from day on. One month they werent gonna see me for a $30 copay i didnt have before. Im fully insured. Thanka for treating a disabled vet up for 2 fusion surgeries trying to do right thing. Dr. Hackl is a great guy but access pain solutions totally sucks. Filing a complaint with the D.E.A.. In 13 years ive NEVER had a dr. or pharmacy problem until now!!!!|My first appointment with him was October 5th, I felt like he was genuinely concerned and willing to help. However, the medication I had been on for years, he does not prescribe. Which is fine, just something to take the pain away and not put me back to the 88 lbs I was at before I originally got treatment 2 years ago. He prescribed Gabapentin to take up to 3 times a day, as well as, Oxyado. A tamper resistant pain medication, I have Education State insurance and top of the line at that, Oxyado it was not covered by insurance and it was $900 out of pocket, which I refused to pay.  They had given me a coupon ""pay no more than $25"" the coupon would not activate no matter what you answered to the questions to activate it. I immediately called and they called in (24) pills of Tylenol 4 to take (2) 3 times a day, enough for 4 days. I have left several messages daily and the recording says they will return your call the next business day, I have not received any calls, the pharmacy has sent 2 refill requests now and they have not gotten an answer either. Unfortunately, at this point from the stomach disease I have, I will no longer be capable of eating until I can get a refill. Which I expressed numerous times I'm unable to eat due to the high tolerance of pain associated with it. He promised me he wouldn't let me get to the point of being unhealthy again, the pain medication took me from 88lbs to 114 because I wasn't having to skip meals weekly just to function. Im just sad to say the people who have abused these medications, have made it almost impossible for people who need it to actually survive. I'm a former nurse and I'm well aware of the DEA rules and regulations, I would also never jeopardize my health or his license by doing anything stupid. I just need help and after 10 days of being seen, I feel like my life is going in reverse. The staff is friendly, Dr. Hackl and his ARNP seem to listen, but promptness doesn't seem to be a priority unless you're in their waiting room. The only reason I was finally able to speak with a real person on the 14th, I called the referral person who originally setup the appointment and she told me they don't usually give refills in between appointments, which is fine, but I was just there on the 5th and the medication they tried to prescribe was $900 and she said that was excessive. She said she would make me a priority to the nurse and doctor first thing Monday. So, we will see what takes place then. I wish I didn't have to write this, but I don't want anyone else in the same position as I am. I've now gone 4 days without food and I'm afraid of the repercussions if it goes on any longer.|I love my doctor, love my nurse.  Front desk can be rude, and billing practice is alful.  Got my first bill after one year and I owed way more than I can pay.  How can this happen when they are suppose to be professionals?|APS treated me for over three years for spinal stenosis, fybromyalgia, many bone injuries and osteoarthritis. I never failed the urine monthly urine test. I always took my meficine exactly as prescribed.They asked me to stop taking a benzodiazepine I'd been taking 18 years as prescribed for PTSD. It was hard, but I completely stopped after 100 days. My sister in-law died so I called my regular physician and asked her to phone in a few of the anxiety meds with zero refills. She phoned-in 90. I only took 2. At my appointment with APS, the nurse did not test my urine. She sent in a very angry nurse who raised her voice and told me they wouldn't treat me anymore. She then became extremely defensive, raised her voice, screamed I ""looked like a crazy person"" and refused to hand me my prescription. This practice was willing to let me go through withdrawals because of their unstable employee. I had to beg another nurse and she , too, thought it was rash and unsafe to stop many years of opiod use and absolutely no abuse. She gave me my Rx. I complied by getting off a benzodiazepine.They are extremely rude and didn't do a UA or count the 88 pills I had with me.",2018-10-20|2018-01-29|2018-06-28|2017-01-25|2019-07-10|2016-10-15|2019-07-26|2018-02-19,5|5|5|5|1|2|4|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care|good_doctors|injection_treatments,,,,,,,,,,ChIJL6PEu8WTtocRiF-4pYFjlBA,49

Thank you|Dr Tougas and Dr Lorenzen are the two most caring and capable doctors I have ever had the privilege to work with. Dr Lorenzen doesn't do this to take care of his bills he does it because he genuinely wants to help people who are in pain. I've never met a doctor that does this for the actual patient.|Great Dr,s they are caring and patience is greatly appreciated ! Was here a few years back they were very helpful then and still today. I'm here for good now and glad they have my pain under control once again and for good  Also the rest of the staff VERY helpful and
caring,|IMO this office has always served a need in the community. A couple of years ago when Dr. Espina took over working along with the awesome Dr. Tougus the Clinic has become a true gem for those of us who have suffered with chronic pain. I am probably one of the full success stories that very few know of. I started with the clinic in 2010 and each and every visit I was treated with the utmost respect. Last year with the help of Dr. Espina and Dr. Tougus I was able to get my pain under control. I weaned down off from my pain meds and have been able to treat my pain with OTC's for the past 8 months. But, I assure you if I needed chronic pain relief I would not hesitate visiting Dr. Espina and Dr. Tougus again. Thank You St. Madron Clinic. From a chronic pain success story.|The hours are best told by reception. On wed they close at noon. May do the same on Fridays. I went there for couple of years, but now go just to allow them to follow care. Dr. Tougas I have known since he was my Chiropractor 10+ years ago. My health has deteriorated & I value his opinion! A majority of Insurance does not cover. But, if you are in true pain, & have documentation as to why, Drs. Tougas and Espina are a force to be reckoned with. I think it might be worth the time & the expense to have them in your corner! This is my opinion. They are NOT going to help unless you can follow their rules to the lettter!|I have had nothing but great experiences from them! They are very careful to make sure they get the right diagnosis the first time and they make sure that you get the best treatment for your situation! I moved here from Washington State where I was using the VA hospital for my treatment and meds but when I got here and went to my first VA appointment at Sparks hospital I felt like I was in hell!!! I have been through three doctors there and I was called a trouble patient and a problem just for asking to be put back on the same pain meds that I had been on in Washington!!! All three of the so called doctors there have been completely worthless, very disrespectful and very damn unprofessional!!! As a matter of fact I have turned them over to Senator Cotton which is a personal friend of mine so I hope they all three end up working at McDonalds!!! St.Madron and its staff are very professional, very helpful and they actually act like they care about me!!!|I love the Dr's and the staff.  I see the same people every 28 days so we have all become friends,  if one doesn't show up, everyone is concerned.  It has a real  comfortable feel about the office although the chairs are uncomfortable. Lol  love Dr Espina and Staff|I have been with Dr.T since he started in the field of chiropractor late 90s,..great Dr.! Listens and cares!

That is his last concern.  One of his first are if you smoke it's going to kill you.  If you take Benadryl it's going to kill you.  Insisted I needed oxygen which I didn't per my lung doctor.  And even if I did I would have died before he got me some.  After 3 months of telling me I needed it I still hadn't gotten it.
Told me I had sleep apnea.  My lung doctor saw the results and said I did not.  When I first went to him I smoked three packs a day.  Last time I went to him I told him I had gotten down to one pack a day.  He started screaming at me that that was not enough.  Screamed I'm done with you and threw my pain pill bottle towards me.  I told him he had no right to talk to me that way and if that is what he had to do then do it.  If my husband hadn't been there in the room with me, I would have been scared to death.  And nobody would believe me if my husband wasn't in the room with me.  Not once in four or five months did he address my pain.

He can be a little tough but I have come to understand his thinking and am lucky to have a doctor like him!  He is great!!|Dr Nelson always seems edgy and angry, you can't get anything done ! The P.A's are condescending and overly rude! They treat you like an addict and absolutely the most unpleasant doc I've ever encountered|Jeckle & Hyde? Threw the syringe on the floor in the operating room & screamed at me ""I'm done! That can't be hurting you!""  I kept telling him he was hurting me & he just kept stabbing the needle in me over 20 times. I have pictures of the needle marks & brusing. I was crying on the operating table & he went nuts.  I never went back. He had yelled at me another time saying ""My God! You're on too much medicine!"" I had been on the meds over 10 years. 9 months of that, his patient, never seen him, always the PA unless it was for an injection. He yelled at me ""You're on the same dose as cancer patients! My God! They have Cancer for God sake! You don't! You don't need that much medication!""
His behavior was scary. I was fearful he was going to hurt me. These outburst were violent & loud. Staff just looked down at the floor or turned their back to me in the operating room & the office when he started yelling. Nobody said a damn word.  Very terrifying experiences. I'm not a buttercup cry baby though. That's why he got to flip out on me a few times. The operating room was pretty traumatizing. I don't understand why the staff in both places don't say anything. He'll end up hurting some eventually. He's definitely got anger issues & delusional about people with chronic pain just wanting to get high. If we wanted to get high we'd be at the trap house getting high. Not a doctors office seeking pain relief. Brown Sequard is so rare there's no studies. There's not enough of us in one place to do studies. The pain is horrific. I can't believe I can handle this much pain with so little medicine. When the CDC lowered the limit on how much pain medication I can have, my health has been declining.

The first 2 went as planned, but today November 22, 2021 I arrived approx 15 minutes prior to my appointment, which was scheduled for 8:30 am.  Upon arrival I was told that I did not have an appointment scheduled, I explained to them that I did in fact have an appointment, and would not have drove an hour if I didn't.  I forgot the paper at the house with the appointment time listed (proof).  I was told I was going to have to wait until they were able to work me in.  I disagreed and told them I was not going to pay for their mistake with my time.. Staff was extremely rude and uncooperative, and refused to see me at my appointment time.

After contacting the office at least five times over a five week period about getting that request in so that I could start physical therapy, it still wasn't done. I ended up having to go to my primary care physician so that they could put the request in. That same day I called and canceled my appointment for follow up with Dr. Kahn and told them that they didn't need to bother anymore. I had taken care of it with my primary care doctor. They then finally put in the paperwork and I got a call the day after my primary care physician got their request in.

I can't take and narcotics or opioids, as im allergic to almost everything. I saw a pain management CPA who referred me to another physician for injections in my back. My experience with them was sad to say the least. They didn't have compassion,  empathy, or a sense of how miserable I was. After 3 failed injections, I was referred to a neurosurgeon to have my back fused. Was told it would work. It didn't. He wanted to do more surgeries. I'm 44 and I have no life. I saw my GYN and had a complete melt down.  She referred me to Dr. Savage.  OMG, best referral ever.  His nurse is amazing,  she listened, she understood what I was going through. She understood I didn't want medications or surgeries. I wanted alternatives to relieve my pain. Dr. Savage came in after and he understood and listened.  I was very pleased with the visit. He did things, ordered things and offered other things to help with the pain. His process was on point.  Very impressed. I will continue to see him and follow his plan. Every person is different and require different plans. He is on point. I haven't felt this much relief in 6 years. I'm not 100% but I can manage with what pain I have left. I slept thru the night for the first time in 6 years. It was amazing.  I was able to stand up straight today and walk without my cane in my house. I will continue to only seem him and try to avoid the surgery that my neurosurgeon wants to do. I recommend Dr. Savage to anyone that will hear me. I see positive outcomes.|I have been going to Dr Savage every other month for 2 years.  He is the absolute best doctor  I have ever been too.  Every time I come in to see Dr. Savage or Jamie Spence they  make a valiant effort to improve your quality of life!  The entire staff is Very polite and professional.  I feel very Blessed to have Dr Savage and Jamie  Spence as my Doctors.|Such a caring team, along with the staff. Very happy with them!|I am a disabled veteran and was referred to Dr. Savage from OKC VA Neurology for Pain Management after three level ACDF surgery a year and a half ago and have experienced additional issues after successful surgery. Dr. Savage and his caring, excellent staff have ensured I understood each step recommended and ultimately  an implant will be done. I am grateful to have been recommended to his care .|Dr. Savage and his entire staff are second to none. I appreciate their customer service. Most of all I feel better! Don't trust me go and see what the will do for you!|After reading these reviews I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS DOCTOR FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT and my doctor just put in a referral for me today! Nope, not after reading this because he will just make me angry and im already in pain. I don't do well with people who don't have sympathy for those of us who have extreme medical conditions like myself. I'm 35, I can already see where this visit will go! I will ask around before I ever see this man! It says MD behind his name. All the good doctors are in OKC or Texas!!|This doctor has been a God send to me. After two back surgeries and 2 more attempted surgeries, i was no longer a candidate for more surgery.  But still lived with severe pain! After being referred to this doctor and having had 2 seperate sessions of back injections,  I was elated....i had to wait awhile due to my TKR for more back injections. When i finally waited the time allotted,  i called to reschedule more back  injections, i was informed that Dr. Savage no longer worked with the Mercy pain clinic... so I have been in severe pain and have searched internet for where he has moved. To no avail. So if anyone has his new location or phone number, I would be so appreciative.

Dr Booth should not be allowed to practice with patients!!!!!!!!!!|I've been seeing Dr Booth for my back for several months now. I have yet to be able to get my medicine through without any problems. Even though this is a Workmen's Comp. case, I will usually wind up paying out-of-pocket for it. His staff seems friendly, but I think they are incompetent, as I have yet to be able to get them to do the paperwork properly so Workmen's Comp. can pay for my medication|Best Dr. Out there. He literally has saved my life. Thank you Dr. Booth. You are amazing!|I have had 4 visits for my cervical spine. 1 initial consult 2 procedures (cervical spine injections) I have been to both offices. The Moore office was clean staff was friendly knowledgeable and their wait times are not long at all. It seemed like I just sat down and they were already calling me back. The nurse practioner was knowledgeable and answered all my questions. I never felt rushed or not listened too.
Fast forward to procedure day in the Edmond office. The office space decor was calming. It is utd and designed with patient care in mind. The reception staff were friendly and efficient during checking. Again, they called me back within 5 minutes. The nursing staff provided patient teaching that was informative and explained in easy to understand terms. I found Dr. Booth to be knowledgable, I never felt rushed. He explained my injury in easy to understand terms. Most importantly, I felt like he truly cared about me and took his oath as a doctor to do no harm very seriously. Recovery care was excellent both visits and although I was nervous the first procedure visit. I was at ease my 2nd because I knew I was in good hands. They take most if not all insurance. I know this because I am covered under federal worker's compensation. I have had great difficulty finding good care that takes OWCP as the payer. I definitely feel blessed to have found Dr. Booth and staff. They will be my go to for neck injections or any other procedure I might need. I pray that none of my family find themselves in a situation requiring these types of procedures. I will not hesitate to recommend Elite pain to my kids and close friends. I rate them as excellent.|I made an appt due to a 2 week old back injury that my chiropractor had not been able to provide any relief from. Following a thorough exam (no imaging) Dr Booth was pretty confident that continuing my current path of treatment would resolve my injury. 2 weeks later my chiropractor was successful in returning me to no pain. I will continue to refer my friends and family to DR Booth with first hand experience in providing the proper advice for a non evasive recovery from my injury.|I have been seeing Dr. Booth for a couple of months now. He has been nothing but amazing. He really takes the time to listen to you and get the root of the problem. I love the fact that I see him every time too. The office and staff have been fabulous as well! I have been extremely pleased with my experience and would definitely recommend Dr. Booth to anyone needing pain management.|I found doctor Booth because my previous doctor stop taking my insurance. He has been very kind and I have two back injections with him and he was very kind and did a wonderful job. The only reason for four stars though is because the follow up with his staff is not very good. They never call back or rarely call back and I have to end up calling a few times to try to get my answer. But overall Dr. Booth has been a great doctor.|Have had a disaster since first of many back surgeries. This is Something I wouldn't wish on anyone. I have gone to many doctors over the past several years and unfortunately most didn't spend the needed time with me, they didn't listen , and probably because I'm such a complex case didn't seem interested in helping me. I was referred to Dr Booth by a friend. I've never had anyone seem more sincere about wanting to help me. His bedside manner is the best I've ever experienced. I understand that no one can ever guarantee that treatment will work but as a patient having a Dr that shows you empathy and is willing to explore every treatment option as Dr BOOTH does is to me what a true Dr represents.

High staff turnover and difficult to understand doctor.

This office will not allow my caregiver to go into appointments with me. I'm a 100% disabled veteran. I have issues communicating my thoughts, especially in pain and in a doc office..

I called before my appointment today, to avoid an unnecessary and painful car ride-- they ignored my concerns and told me to come in to discuss if my caregiver can go back to the appointment with me.
I had to cancel all appointments and injections and find help elsewhere.
The injection this clinic previously did on me, caused extreme increased pain. Very frustrating!!!! Would literally rather quit my medicine cold, than give them any more of my money.
I have waited over an hour on more than one occasion, sometimes the staff is friendly sometimes they're rude.
Dr. Soo's Office's claims about safety are not legitimate, the VA allows my caregiver to go into ALL appointments, as they understand it's appropriate.|Dr. Soo is an amazing doctor. He listens to your concerns and explains things so you can understand.
When I saw him for the first time (2009) I was having to use a wheelchair, walker and cane to get around because my back was in such bad shape ( I had already had 2 surgeries by another doctor that did not fix my problem). He did a 3rd surgery and after not being able to walk or work I was finally able to go back to work in 2011.
I highly recommend him!|Best Orthopedic Dr !  Dr Soo is a compassionate and understanding Dr. He will tell you the truth and is very knowledgeable!  His staff is very thorough and good!  Can't truly express My appreciation of the help I've received! .|After surgery I was scheduled a follow up 8 days later.  However, they only allow 7 days so now they say I owe a $40 copay.  Then still in severe pain I returned to see why I am not feeling better and was refused service.  Told I had a past due balance and would charge another  $40.  I AM SORRY I EVER WENT TO DR. SOO.  Still suffering and having to return to the ER.|I have had2 spinal fusions by previous surgeon's. Dr Soo recently did my C 4 to C 6 neck fusion.  I absolutely would refer anyone to him.  He not onalso is handling.my follow up care and pain management.  No need to have to go to yet another Dr.|I have seen Dr. Soo 3 times. Two of the times I waited for more than an hour past my appt time. One of the times, today even, I waited for 90 minutes without seeing the Dr. When I asked a staff member if I needed to be re-scheduled at a time more convenient for the Dr, she responded very rudely. All she would have had to do is say I'm sorry but instead got snippy. Only one member of their staff (Keisha) even had the decency to say hello. The rest barked orders with zero pleasantries exchanged. Aside from the inability to keep appointment times REMOTELY close, Dr. Soo himself is pleasant and good to work with but their staff is lacking. If you hate your job, find something better to do with your time.|Dr Soo did an ACDF C5-C6 on me. He is compassionate, patient, kind, and explains everything very well! The staff has always been wonderful!|I only wish I could of meet him much sooner!!!

Hm funny they don't have any reviews! These guys are terrible! Front office staff are rude. I was not notified about dr Kemp leaving to open his own practice and I was told if I wanted to stay at pain specialists I'd need to start as a new patient!

We were rescheduled and the clinic moved. I used the link they sent and it sent us to Darlene Ave in Springfield not Darlene Ave in Eugene. Our Appt was at 11:00, we started calling at 10:40 called & called. All calls went to voicemail. We arrived 20 minutes late and was told by the front office people without checking with the PA that we could not been seen that day. I mentioned we were calling & calling and I was told ""We were busy responding to voicemails"". We were told they would call and reschedule which they did. They did call and set an appointment my wife had asked a few questions and the person from the clinic she grew impatient and rude. They called back shortly and said we need to find a new provider. My wife is awaiting results from an MRI ordered from Oregon Pain Specialist. To leave someone in the dark about an MRI that was ordered by the clinic is very unprofessional to say the least. I don't know what motivated the cancellation I hope not racism. I will be contacting the Oregon Medical Authority and Oregon Medical Association. I want to make sure the Doctors are aware of this.|Was between 1st and 2nd insurance-required tests when i caught COVID. Tried to reschedule several times but no one called me back. Then Dr Kemp left the practice (the doctor I was assigned) and, since I wanted to see Dr Morgan to begin with, I continued leaving messages to try to finish testing and have procedure done. So far no one has called me back. Guess I'll try to find another facility to have my pain dealt with. My back is much worse after the one test Dr Kemp did. It's very difficult that no one answers the phone and you have to keep leaving messages.|Unfortunately, I have been a pain patient for many years and I have dealt with several different doctors, physicians assistants, etc., some good, some not so good, but none as good as Marissa. She is very knowledgeable, which is always a plus, but more importantly in my opinion is her personality and how she deals with her patients.

My frustration started when I was asked to fill out their questionnaire; normally not a big deal but the system they use made me do it multiple times. Okay, technology is hard sometimes...I get it. Every time I filled it out, the system said done and complete.
They did not show up for my first virtual appointment; when I reached out to the office, they told me they never received my information from their portal that I had filled out multiple times.
They didn't call, they just no showed after I had taken half a day off to accommodate the virtual meeting request.
so...I rescheduled.
In between my next appointment I received a call from their office asking how I would like to pay (er...prepay) for an injection?! A prepaid medical procedure; nope, that's not how it works.
I decided to cancel the in person appointment agreeing to speak with them on the phone to discuss what had transpired and why I wouldn't prepay for a procedure.
This ""business"" sent my Insurance company a bill in the amount of $568 for the less than 2 minutes I was on the phone (calling it an outpatient, office visit new patient), I was responsible for $50 of that. I would strongly recommend you look at other clinics than get jerked around and ripped off by this one.|All I can say is don't go. The staff there is incompetent. The nurse messed up the IV.

Left with more pain than going in. They also didn't call to let me know they were done. Really disappointed being sold pain relief and being put into more pain.|When the staff of ANY business or service is uncaring, rude, inconsiderate, and even threatening, and gets away with it, that is a direct reflection of the owners or managers feelings about their patients or customers.
NEVER AGAIN!

Edit after owner/manager comment, adding:
Oregon Clinic sent us to you for a CONSULT before 2 steroid injections were to be done in my neck. Filled out some paperwork, did $20 co-pay, and indicated on an anatomy drawing where the pain was. Shown to a room, wife sat in chair, I sat on exam table. Pleasant young lady took vitals.
Anup came into the room, sat in chair at computer, seemed rushed and as if his mind was elsewhere.
Asked where the pain was, and I told him that it was on the drawing. He then said, you know nothing is going to happen here until you have done physical therapy, and a physical therapist has signed off on it. I said Oh no, another delay, you don't know how much pain I am in and for how long. He said Yes I do know, I see people in pain all day long. My wife said Let's go and we got up to go to the door. Anup got up from his chair, rushed over, got in my wifes personal space, and said Don't you stand in front of me. I said to my wife, Maybe we should see a chiropractor, he said, Maybe you should. We left, both crying, down the hall and out.
On top of that, you get a message to my Primary Care Physician stating that we came in wanting an injection (not true. We knew it was for a consult). Also said my wife (74 years) stood up and walked towards him (just the opposite). We are now being taken care of by Cornell Pain Clinic. We still are upset by the treatment AND the false statements relayed to my doctor.
And your billing of $568.00 to my health insurance.
Post will not change.|Portland pain care has excellent in person customer service. My issue was with over the phone service.

I was treated rudely and pushed aside the person I spoke to even went as far to blame a missed first appointment on my but it was due to technical issues with med Locker that was later explained that their text message link for the service don't work properly.

I later missed a secondary appointment due to a health issue which should be understandable. When I called to reschedule, Andreas G. was rude abrupt and unkind. I understand if someone's having a stressful day, but after receiving such excellent in person care I was severely disappointed with that employee's way of communicating and dealing with me, after trying to explain the situation.

The appointment itself was fine and he wanted to refer me to see a neurologist, stating he didn't think he would be able to resolve the issue. The neurologist's office was having a severe issue with receiving referrals and told me to call back in a week. When I did, they hadn't received anything from Dr Stapleton's office. I asked Dr. S's office to resend it, they said ok and 10 minutes later, called me to say they could not send referrals and I would need to ask my primary Dr to refer me to another office. I was also prescribed medication which was never sent to my pharmacy.

It's beyond frustrating to be jerked around when you're in severe pain with numb extremities.|I found the staff at Portland Pain Care to be bossy and have no consideration for the patient. I wanted to ask Dr. Stapleton a question and they told me in no uncertain terms that I could not. After the procedure I had a migraine headache and wanted to know what steroids were used. Again I was told that I had to do as they said and that I had to schedule another shot appointment. I walked out of his office and went home. Several years later I had another MRI and his office called for over a week daily and I told them not to call me again. after telling them that about 10 times they finally quit calling.|Getting answers for my migraines and arthritis has not been easy between education and navigating insurance.

She has always been very professional, patient, understanding, and reasonable. She has an amazingly calm 'bed side manner' and you can tell She truly cares for her patients. There have been a few office personnel that I would say are not so good at patient care, but that is rare and does not sway me to give a lower review. At the end of the day, I am there for the doctor, and she is amazing.|I went in to discuss options regarding treatment for my bulged discs. The staff was unfriendly and treated me like I was a drug addict. They wanted me to take a picture for their records and to take a drug test. The doctor was reassuring and friendly but almost too friendly. When I was called to schedule, the lady on the phone was almost gatekeeping information from me about how the costs would be. The doctor told me one thing but the actual bills came up entirely different and they refused to clarify until AFTER treatment. The whole place seemed like a sales pitch overall, I was so uncomfortable that I refused to return for treatment.

At first I was not going to write a review, but a whole year later I got a letter discussing the greed between my insurance provider and their contract. Apparently they have decided that I care about their failing business deals even after the way they treated me. The hypocrisy and irony alone made me return and write a review. At the end of the day, it was greed and the personalities of 5 different people within the company made me scared of the quality of care that I would have been given. I felt as if I was better off in pain than to be made a sucker.|I've been receiving care from CPM for a couple of years now and I've never had a problem with them until my visit this week. I was absolutely heartbroken (I mean I cried) when I found out that my friend Miss Tricia was let go. I have never met anyone more dedicated to her job, patients, and coworkers in my life except my mother, she was what makes  The Dalles location my go to place. She remembers everyone whether they've met once or multiple times, she's always happy and remembers even the smallest goals that patients are trying to reach, she celebrates with them no matter how small a victory it is, and in all honesty for me SHE was what made the CPM The Dalles location both special and family. CPM did themselves a great disrespect by letting her go because I guarantee without a doubt that you will never find someone more dedicated to her job and the patients it sees.|I saw Dr. Yoon for a cortisone injection on my L4-L5 joint on the right side. I have suffered from nerve pain from a bulging disc there for a long time. Dr. Yoon was a really good provider, talked me through everything, and placed it very well. One day later I am already feeling relief.|I was previously treated at Columbia Pain Center for low back problems and I am now being treated for neck problems.  Each time I have been greeted and treated with the utmost respect and care.  I highly recommend this location to any and everyone experiencing chronic ongoing pain.  Thank you Dr. Khemlani and staff for the wonderful treatment you have provided to me.|I'm only allotting 1 star because it doesn't allow 0.

1. I've been a patient at this clinic for a few years. This year my insurance changed. I wasn't even allowed to schedule an appointment without having my ID number, despite their office having access to the insurance system to verify my coverage. I wasn't provided the option to speak to their billing dept, which has access to this system. I was completely denied anything until I had my ID number.

2. Once they confirmed my insurance information, I called almost daily leaving several messages, including urgent message and it took them a week to even call me back.

3.  I have occipital neuralgia, which causes debilitating stabbing head pain on the entire right side of my head. I'm not contacting their office for narcotics or opioids. Anyone with this level of nerve pain anywhere in their body knows this doesn't work. I was requesting an urgent office visit for nerve block, lidocaine with kenalog, injections into my scalp to alleviate my excruciating nerve pain temporarily while I wait to get on schedule for medial branch block. I not only couldn't get a call back, I couldn't even get in for an urgent visit for these injections. Our PCPs offices refer to these specialty clinics because the PCPs can't or won't do these nerve blocks and leaves it to these ""specialists"" to perform the injections. We don't know when these nerve flares will happen but when they do, it isn't an unreasonable ask to get in to our physicians offices immediately for some relief for debilitating pain. The clinics should have this built into their schedule for urgent appointments for exactly these types of situations. It is completely absurd not only I couldn't get a call back but also couldn't get in for an urgent appointment. It resorted to my mother driving me 2 hours from Estacada to Tillamook to get a nerve block yesterday.

4. I finally get a call today from the clinic to schedule an appointment. Soonest available for JUST an appointment, no injection because I hadn't been seen since September or October, is 4/9. Oh, and the request for nerve block was put in but of course is waiting for insurance authorization. Funny no one called to tell me that. But also sad I saw a provider to give me the nerve block yesterday before I was even given the common courtesy of a timely returned phone call, especially when left urgent message, let alone the PAIN CLINIC not getting me into their office on an urgent basis to perform the injections themselves. NO...I HAD TO GO TO TILLAMOOK FOR A NERVE BLOCK. We live in a metro area. If anywhere should provide quick and timely treatment it's here. But no, I had to go to a rural area for urgent and necessary treatment.

Needless to say, I can't even begin to explain the level of frustration and disappointment in this clinic, their lack of professionalism, lack of empathy for their patient and lack of ability to provide prompt proper, reasonable and necessary medical treatment for their patient. And given the type of patients they provide this type of medical treatment for, I'm very likely not the only patient that has dealt with these issues with this clinic.|I had a 7:30. a.m. appointment for an epidural injection procedure. All of the staff were so kind and professional. Mila (PA?) was especially nice to meet. She was compassionate, knowledgeable, and thorough.

The injection was so gentle (not my first), and my nerves told me it was right on target, but not painfully so. I was also shown imaging of the procedure, which I really appreciated. Regretfully, I don't remember her name, but she was really skillful and gentle in how she did the injection. Minimal discomfort for me, and I chose local only, not sedation.

This is a place of healing.  Highly recommend if you have a choice in PM providers, My back and leg thank you all for your help!  I especially appreciate that it will help me to experience some less painful time while I wait for my lumbar surgery to address the core problems.|I went in to Columbia Pain Care extremely nervous and came out a very happy camper .

Thank you for reaching out and addressing my concerns.

I was seen by Dr Prabhu for my very first appointment. I already had my medications figured out before coming here and hoping to get them reviewed. Dr Prabhu was on time and listened me and answered all questions however she was very pushy about getting injections. She told me if I opt to get an injection at a hospital her office will not continue to manage my pain because things get complicated. I did not feel like she was considering the cons having too frequent injections as I had my first one 2 months ago at a hospital. This was my first (and probably last) time going to a pain clinic, if this is how things are working, I could just use my own PCP which would be easier to get appointments at least. Then I had a medication question on the app, the nurse returned to me at the same day which is great however she does not sound like she knows anything about a simple pain killer I was using. Whatever I asked, she said ""of course you can do it if you want to"". It was one of the worst medical advice I have ever heard! Giving 2 stars because Dr Prabhu did her best to listen to me and answered all my questions. Everything else is just 0.|Dr. Prabhu has taken excellent care of me for quite a while.

I want to also give them a special praise, because of their multifaceted approach to healing, which engages the patient process.

Thank You APM!|While it's absolutely right in line with exactly what I expect to see from this office, I'm very surprised to see all of these positive reviews from patients who have only been with this office for a very short period of time. I urge you to read the negative views and the responses this clinic offers to them. They literally villainize the patients and refuse any kind of compassion or attempt to take responsibility. I was a patient at this office for YEARS! After the amazing doctor I saw retired and I was left to find a doctor who cared. This was my second attempt. Not only did I experience a complete lack of professionalism, but I  had to literally make sure they were constantly doing what they said they would do and found that they were not. I would constantly leave messages, telling them of issues with my insurance. That they would require a prior authorization, that they wouldnt cover a medication. I'd spend hours on the phone with insurance then immediately notify the office as to what was required of them to proceed. Every single time my messages were ignored and for days I would be out of medication because the medical assistants never told my provider. In another instance, when My medication was cut twice without even being notified. At one point My insurance wouldn't cover the medication I was on and the office refused to complete the appeal process, my provider  sent in a perscriprion for a new medication but they didn't bother calculating what an equivalent dose would be they just gave me the smallest possible dose and cut my MME by 80%. When I got the response  of. ""Well there is nothing I can do about it now"" from the provider I made an appt with dr fiks  and his response was ""well I wouldn't have done it that way, but it's done now and we're not going back."" He didn't give a crap that it was causing me complete agony.  I had been suffering for so long it was literally May and  I still couldn't put my Christmas tree or decor away. This doctor cares for profit over patients and I warn you, it may be happy and easy at first, but be aware that you will have to double check their work every two of the way and even then, they don't give a crap what they do to you when they drop the ball.|Since My first appointment, I have felt supported and understood. I finally have a team behind me all the way! I've never had such great care! From the fabulous team of Dr.Fiks, the medical assistants, and front desk staff... to the Fit Cam app and support from Nurse Barbara, monthly, and the surgical staff, it's just been a great experience! And definitely what I've needed!
I'm learning so much about how the brain and body are connected, in regards to pain. Even how we express our pain. Loving the exercises and music therapy for relaxation and calming.

I highly recommend Dr. Fiks, and staff, at Advanced Pain Management Center!|Dr. Fiks is GREAT. He is knowledgeable. But the phone system is horrible. I'm only able to leave voicemails and half the time they don't get returned and I'm told they didn't get the voicemail. Their phone system needs to be updated as it gives the option for a text and it automatically texts you when you call them but I was told they no longer do the texts.

I'm adding an edit. I still think Dr. Fiks is a great doctor and one girl and the front desk and his medical assistant are great but if you have any issues don't count on the manager calling or assisting. I had my appointment cancelled and I wasn't notified, Karen claims she called and left me a voicemail but I didn't receive it and she only called once- you always call patients more than once when cancelling their appointment. Karen refused to come out and talk to me and said she would call me, this was 5 days ago. I also emailed her 2 days ago and no response.

Again, Dr Fiks is a great doctor, just be prepared for issues and no follow up by the manager.|Dr. FIKS himself treated me very bad. He only cares about how much money he can make off of a patient. I have been seeing another PA at this office for over 7 years. Unfortunately yesterday I had to see Dr. First, he tried 4 times to charge me for things I don't need. When I said No to each extra charge. He tried to get rid of me. I owe the office no money. But the way he treated me was absolutely terrible.  He should not be treating Anyone!|Dr Fiks and Bridget have been wonderful and caring to my issues. They take the time to listen and we work together to find solutions to my issues. The medical assistants and front desk are amazing as well.|Dmitriy Shore p.a. for dr. Fiks should lose his job for denying me treatment after over a decade of the clinic supporting my dependancy. His computer had faulty info, and rather than letting me explain he called me a liar and find some one else to give me meds.  No weaning me off the morphine dependancy,, just leave. I have proof of his error, but there was nothing but his mistaken attitude.

They listen and quickly get to the problem. The women at the front desk are super nice and quickly get you registered.  The only problem in the beginning was getting approved for a surgery.

But I would suggest calling your insurance company to get the approval done in a more efficient timely matter.|There is about a month to two month wait period to get in. Then the doctor doesn't read any of your history and suggests treatments you don't want because you've already tried them and they didn't work. And then they do a drug test, which you're not allowed to go anywhere else to get done, it HAS to be through their office, and the results take 4 weeks to come back. And then two months later you get hit with a near $300 bill because they charge over $800 for a drug test. $800 for a drug test and I never went back because I ended up getting what I needed from a different doctor.

Not tell you that and then your responsible to pay whatever your insurance won't cover. They refuse to do pain management narcotics contract even though I qualify and have passed there drug screenings etc primary care sent me for that reason and they refuse. They did some placebo to my spine and then charged me $160 for something that did nothing but invade my spine and make more tissues damage. Try to be patient and show them your reasonable and will try what they suggest and that's all they suggested was a freaking placebo.

I want to give a huge shout out to Danilyn, Genesis, and Amber!

You three have made each visit exceptionally warm and friendly. I appreciate each one of you going above and beyond to treat with me with respect as we navigated my shoulder/neck issue together.

Never once did I feel like a burden, and you all explained the process so clearly.

I have nothing but good things to say, and I am so lucky to have been seen at this facility.

Lastly, I want to give some praise to the man Dr. Stapleton. You were prompt, friendly, and effective. This was a night and day experience that I was unable to receive from other providers like Dr. Ryan Thompson or Dr. Michael Hwang.

Keep up the great photography work, and thanks again for your efforts and attention to detail.|Immaculate vibes from the whole staff. Really nice people. They worked with me to get to the bottom of my pain when the initial diagnosis and treatment recommended by my PCP wasn't working. So glad I got referred to these folks!|I wasn't sure about this clinic at first, but I'm adjusting and they've done an excellent job.

Dr. Stapleton is experienced and knowledgeable, and always answers my questions. He's very efficient. The procedures are painless, so I am very grateful for that; they make sure you're comfortable. The first round of RFA L3-L5 and L5-S3 (I think) worked really well for about nine months or so. Some people experience pain relief after one treatment, but it can take three or four rounds for permanent relief. I'm starting round two in a couple of weeks.

Be sure to make a list of questions before the appointment. If you hang up too soon, you'll have to wait for another appointment to ask about anything you forgot. You can't call back to ask, even if there is time left in your appointment. Probably a billing thing.

If you get off to a rocky start, give them a chance and some time to work with you! Danilynn is friendly and kind, and the medical assistant asks her questions and gets you connected right away for video calls. Android and iPhone are both supported for video calls now! Woohoo!

My experiences with this team over the past couple of years has been life changing. For low back pain, it's been the only thing that's really helped me.|So my husband has suffered from what he  thought was SI joint pain. We scheduled appointment here & without talking to Doctor just Danilyn was  recommended to get lidocaine shot which only last 6 hrs tops,then cortisone shot 2 freaking weeks later.Went to Wilsonville to get shot, was not impressed didn't get info on  how long or if this shot would work He's been in extreme pain since he has seen this place hoping to get results & have not got any improvement. You do not see a REAL Doctor & they should not rely on your own self diagnosis. They don't return your calls or follow thru on doing what they say they're going to do following up on your medical insurance , as my insurance does not require a lidocaine  shot before as a test run it's  the docs decision which Stapleton said it was not his choice. So is it the $$ or what, if they could only see the suffering . Would not recommend this place!!!months later still in same pain NO follow up asking how I'm doing TOTAL waste of time/$$ plz don't go to this place!!|I have been under the care of Dr. Stapleton and his staff for the last year. The courtesy and care I have been given during this time has been outstanding. The associates in the office take great care in asking the right questions and decide on the solution. My injections have worked every time until I do something I shouldn't. I am thankful for the care I have been given and appreciate all of their kindnesses.|The staff were great - every one of them.  Pre-procedure prep right through the procedure itself.

The facilities were fine - except for that awful chair I had to use instead of a gurney.  It was uncomfortable and terribly unprofessional - especially considering the fact that you charge were the same as places like Columbia River Surgery Center.

I would use your facility again if my doctor requested it, but I would definitely lower my expectations - except for your staff.  They were wonderful!

Tommie then took me back - what a great personality to have representing your office! Very professional and cheerful, listened astutely and showed empathy.

I saw Dr. Rask and really appreciated him too. He listened, asked good questions. I walked out with an initial treatment plan and now the challenge is getting insurance authorization. As you might imagine, I wish I did not have these health issues. But it seems to me that the clinic is a good place to be a patient. Thank you!|The doctors and staff at CPM are awesome .  They're efficient and friendly all at the same time.  Dr. Rask puts me at ease when a procedure could be quite painful.

I look forward to further visits to implement the plan that has been chosen.|Was 8 minutes late due to traffic, plus it took front clerk a few minutes to even find me in the system. She checked me in then after waiting five more minutes, I was called up and told he couldn't see me because I was late. Next appointment available is in a month. This is definitely not what I expected. Almost every other medical facility in Corvallis has been so great and accommodating. Lets scroll forward almost two months. I was able to get in, Insurance approved a procedure. I followed up a few weeks after approval.. and apparently their only scheduler was out two weeks ill.. so here I sit with still no resolve.  The Doc seems like a nice enough fella. The girl that answered the phone today was pleasant (nice surprise) We need a few more choices in Corvallis... or these folks need more staff.
I sure hope this place improves. I want to change my review to a more positive one... still waiting for something to turn around with these guys.|Letter to Patrick Rask:
Today I saw you for the first time in hopes to find someone empathetic to my pain, eager to find a solution, however you are the most rude and angry little man I have met yet in the medical field. To state that you are not going to be Salems ""relief valve"" as if the city or hospitals of Salem sent me to you. I knew from your demeanor you had no intent on taking me on as a patient after two minutes of talking to you. Have you seen your ads underneath your clinics website online? Look at the first one, is that how you treated me. Was it necessary to demean my PA? And as far as your comment to not knowing how to judge people's pain or learning that in school.....maybe you should consider a career change. I'm on the fence on reporting this to the OMB, maybe I'll decide after you respond or not. Interestingly as you told me you told your receptionist you weren't interested, you still made an appointment, charged my insurance and took my co-pay after you had decided weeks ago you had no interest. To drive over an hour and a half to your clinic the pain you put me in just to discriminate against me is absolutely shameful. I hope, that there are still a few decent dr.s still out there who wish to care for there patients.

She took the time to really find out about my back pain history gave me so much helpful information. Best new patient exam ever.|I've been seeing Dr Morgan for... Gosh I'm not even sure, maybe 8+ years!   Honestly, as a person with multiple health issues, I have grown to reeeeally dislike going to the doctor. That said, I always appreciate my check-in's with Dr Morgan. She has ALWAYS been so respectful. She is a great listener and I think that my input about my health really matters to her.
Dr Morgan is VERY knowledgeable.  I appreciate it so much that she has always tries to do her level best to consider my overall health, meet my needs as much as she can, and help me understand any information I may be confused or concerned about.
The staff at Pain Specialists of Oregon is always respectful and kind. They are very "" on it"" , I have never had to wait long to be seen, or receive a call back. Overall the clinic is just an awesome, calm space with good energy and great people.

6+ stars for Dr Morgan and staff at P. S. O|This wil.ne kind of long but for everyone suffering with pain and desperate to get better, I wanted to leave a full in depth review.

Dr. Morgan is one of the very few doctors who will sit there with you and listen to you and then work together to find a solution to your problem. Most doctors just want to talk themselves and have zero interest in what you have to say and then they just want to present a solution that's usually a generic one. Dr. Morgan listens to you and then works with you back and forth, this allows her to find a solution that's unique to your situation and works best for you. Because of this we've been able to find pain management that has actually worked really well and has allowed me to have a fairly great quality of life whereas before I was so sick with pain I missed out on everything. Now there's a new surgery out that just passed FDA approval, or at least was scheduled to by Jan 2024 called 'Hydrafil', that literally seems like the perfect procedure to fix my issue and I will now be working on getting that procedure done.

Other doctors tried pushing me into the typical fusion of the spine so they can cut my pain meds and send me on my way and there's a great chance that could have made me worse off or have done nothing.

Since Dr. Morgan worked with me constantly and allowed me to be on pain meds longer since new procedures were always coming out and we were waiting.for one that made the most sense, it made it so I was able to make it long enough to get to this new procedure which seems to be a spot on best solution for me.

The procedure is minimally invasive, has an extremely quick recovery time, and appears to be a permanent fix. Other doctors wouldn't have worked with me on pain management as long as a Dr. Morgam has and would have had me do a procedure I more than likely would have regretted that wouldn't have fixed my issue, but Dr. Morgan worked closely with me until the right surgery came out and she never once made me feel guilty or bad about my pain meds like most doctors do. I never once was made to feel like a drug seeker and now here I am, more than likely going to have this new procedure any day now as soon as the FDA stamps the seal of approval and I will be living a brand new pain free life for the first time since Feb 2010 when I broke my back and my fractured my neck in a car accident and.since then have ruptured and lost 3 discs in my back due to poor doctors treating me like a drug seeker the minute you mention back and neck pain.

I can't thank Dr. Morgan enough and I can now see the light at the end of the tunnel and as soon as the FDA puts their final stamp of approval on this procedure, I'll be in and out within a few hours with a permanent fix putting and end to 14 years worth of agonizing pain. I can't recommend Dr. Morgan enough. She is by far the best pain specialist I've ever had and as far as doctors go in general, she is absolutely an incredible doctor. If you're suffering from pain and need help to figure out your problem so you can get yourself fixed and living a normal life again from pain, absolutely have your primary care refer you out to Pain Specialists of Oregon and to Dr. Donna Morgan.|Dr Morgan has been my pain specialist for over 15 years now & I wouldn't have it any other way. She's caring & compassionate without being too soft on you. She has your best interests in mind while she cares for you. Through her care I have a spinal pump that helps to relieve my pain & together we weaned me off all my oral opiate pain meds.

He's always listened attentively to my concerns and has provided effective treatments, including steroid injections and nerve ablations. His expertise and compassionate approach have made a significant positive impact on my quality of life. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking relief from chronic pain!!!|Being new to Central Oregon, I needed to establish with an office, so I did a google search and found Central Oregon Spine & Sport.  The scheduler I spoke with was very helpful, easy to talk with and had excellent customer service. My first visit did not disappoint. All office staff are kind and respectful and Christy Barlow is amazing. She is attentive and professional. When the conversation surrounded my issue, she provided a treatment option with an honest opinion of what else might be going on and her thoughts of what would be next if I don't get the results we are hoping for. Christy is ""real"" and laughed with me when discussing how I ended up in Central Oregon from the valley. She made my visit very comfortable. I am so thankful I chose a Central Oregon Spine & Sport to evaluate and treat my SI joint pain.|My doctor sent a referral there. They said they could get to my neck injection right away, When my saif Claim was approved, They would not even return my representatives phone calls. I have tried personally to call them at least 15 to 20 times with no answer and no return phone calls.
I have basically given up on these guys. I have no idea how they can run a business.  With the people they have in their main office very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.|My wife has been going here for a couple years now, so I thought I would see if they can help me with my back issues. Due to insurance requirements, they have to perform test injections before they can perform the nerve ablation. My wife has been through a few of these, so I am not completely ignorant of how it works. Unfortunately, the test only makes the pain much worse. When they contact me the next day, I tell them that the pain is much worse, but the person on the phone did not believe me when I told them it was worse. I chose not to go through the rest of the procedure. The primary issue isn't that the test injection didn't work. It seems like they have dumped me as a patient. I had some MRIs performed and was supposed to have follow-up appointments. However, I have heard nothing, and it has been two weeks since the scans. Sadly, this is where our health care system is going. The providers are being paid less and less, but they have to bring in the clients to pay the bills. If your body doesn't respond how they need it to, you are out the door.|Was on the phone with the receptionist for over 10 min 2 weeks ago to get an appt. She talked and talked about how good the doctors were and how they could help me with a herniated disc. I wait 2 weeks for my appt, during this time I can't lift anything and can't even sleep most nights. I arrive to my appointment 10 min early and they act like they have no clue who I am, I don't have an appointment. She actually sends me to another office to check with them. I come back and say I definitely have an appointment with Dr. Barlow. She just says well we don't have an appointment. I then ask if I was I their system. She says yes....I ask why would I be in the system without an appointment. She says something under her breath about referrals. I don't have a referral. She doesn't even try to apologize for her obvious mistake she makes just tells me I can come back next Monday if I want to be seen. Such a waste of time and so poorly handled, as though it was somehow my fault.|Can't recommend Christy Barlow enough. Saw her for a ruptured disc in my neck and she exhibited all of the characteristics you want in a health care professional: knowledgeable, patient, compassionate, personable, and articulate. Very glad to have found someone in sports medicine that I feel comfortable with and trust. I saw her a couple of years ago for pretty intense and recurring knee pain and her recommendation was spot on. Fixed me right up - haven't had an issue since!|Terrible place. If you want someone to see you soon go somewhere else this is not the place. I made an appointment for a knee injury in JUNE they cancelled it because of ""something in the office"" for a whole month later in july. so fine I'll wait. July comes they call for my insurance but I've been out of town and didn't have access to the card. I called them several times and left multiple voicemails and not a single person got back to me then they said they need to reschedule AGAIN and in AUGUST. So now I'm waiting a whole three months?? terrible customer service, at least offer me a sooner appointment for cancelling my first one. I'll be going somewhere else from now on.|I met with Christine Barlow today about some neck pain and nerve problems I must say she is absolutely top shelf Gave her a 5 star review only because they don't have 10 stars!

Dr Suresh is thorough and helpful. I've had two neck ablations and two steroid injections with good results.|I will start by saying I have never left a review on any platform as I don't think that it is the most constructive way to give feedback, however,  in this situation and circumstance I feel that it is important to do so.
I was a patient over the last year, being referred to this clinic by a specialist. After over 5 visits to this clinic, the first one being extremely traumatizing after receiving an injection into my SI joint with no prepatory support beforehand or even discussing the options of support for the procedure. All and all I could spell out all the details of the experiences here and about how with each appointment I was disregarded and gaslit, but this is not the platform for all the details.  I maintained my care and treatment at Cornell pain clinic trying to be patient with the process, unfortunately leaving every appointment distressed and in more pain and feeling hopeless. I wish I would have trusted my gut after my first appointment.
I was finally referred to an excellent pain specialist (Dr Joseph Staplton) I have been properly diagnosed with SI joint dysfunction. I am now on the path to recovery.  I regret all the time (time being the most critical) and money that I invested with a team that does not listen or have respect for their clients and clearly do not care about you. I would not recommend receiving care here.|My experience with Dr. Chand and his staff was nothing but positive. I was having a difficult time even getting in at another office. Scheduling appointments and follow up appointments were always 6-10 weeks out and getting insurance approval was over 4 weeks. Follow up visits were with a PA.

Dr Chand's office got me an immediate appointment and after my appointment they got insurance approval for my needed procedure within 24 hours. No waiting 8 weeks for every next needed appointment. Scheduling was never more than 2 weeks out. Follow up appointments are with Dr. Chand himself and not a PA. With regard to the actual procedures, I felt like I was in very competent hands. The Cornell Pain Clinic staff were always very polite and friendly.  Dr Chand was successful in relieving my back pain and I'm very grateful to him and his staff. I'm back to enjoying life.

Randall Miller|I had severe lower back pain over 3 years ago and was referred to Dr. Chand by Oregon Clinic Neurology. I had steroid injections on both sides of a disc. Friends told me that sometimes you have to have it done every six months.
I have been pain-free ever since without needing to return.
I am about to see Dr. Chand again for shots between two neck vertebrae (pinched nerve). I was referred elsewhere but asked if it could be switched to here.
I never read Cornell Pain Clinic reviews until today. I am impressed by the doctor's response to all of the lower reviews. With understanding, compassion, and care. With genuine concern, unlike most businesses or services that are given a low rating. This is a good place to seek help.

Update:
Injections into neck vertebrae worked wonderfully.
Finally pain-free and able to resume normal functions.
Thank you, Dr. Chand!!|I was using a cane since November 2023. Since I've seen Dr. Chand and had injections. My hip no longer hurts. I don't use a cane anymore. I think he's wonderful. He cares and he listens|Timely and they hit the nerve bundle on the first attempt.  While I know the steroid shot only lasts so long I am so improved (beyond my expectations) that I almost can't wait till the next shot.

Staff is excellent and friendly and Doctor has a great touch.|I have been experiencing Sciatic pain. I received a referral for a from my doctor (March, 2023)  to Dr. Chand for an L5-S1 injection. I highly recommend him!
The office was very responsive, the procedure was efficient, painless, and the Dr verbally walked me through what would happen next during the procedure. It was very successful. The pain returned in December. I contacted Dr Chand's office. They scheduled me right away and I received a second injection,  again, very successful. The follow up visit was thorough and very helpful regarding future steps if needed.|Suresh, the main doctor was belittling, derogatory, unprofessional, and very unfriendly. He did not use a single medical document, he did not perform a single standardized medical test. He simply scribbled notes on a paper and called it good! This is after a 40 min wait, no one there but me. Only for the apt to be 10 mins and he escorted me out as fast as possible after the paycheck! Stay away. Himalayan doctor certs?

Now I have Shea De Klotz. She cares, is smart and understanding. She sees the whole picture. Its not just about getting pain medication, its treating the body, at diff angles that add to pain, from stress, sleep, etc. Everyone there is nice and respectful.|I have been with Dr Rosenblum for 4 or 5 years. He takes the time necessary and very easy to talk to. I love this doctor for pain management. He cleared up daily disabling migraines with surgery and botox that allowed me to lower my meds significantly. Changed my life  Laura|Dr. Stuart Rosenblum has been treating me for approximately 12 years. I have a lot of issues in my back, spine, Fibromyalgia etc. He has taken the time to find out what was really going on with me. Due to him finding out what was really going on with me, he was able to pinpoint my pain and properly diagnose me.  That allowed me to be able to continue working at a job I truly loved. I contracted Legionnaire's disease a few years later & now I can no longer do my job. I am also treated by his physician's assistant, who is one sharp cookie. I feel so blessed.|After a decade under his care, I'd highly recommend Dr Rosenblum to anyone with a documented need of long term pain management.  His expertise and professionalism is unwavering, and has greatly improved my health and abilities despite living in constant pain.|I would give zero stars if I could. I missed my initial appointment because my father passed away, and the last thing on my mind was an appointment at the clinic. I forgot to call and cancel because I was busy trying to take care of my mother. I finally called to reschedule and they said due to their ""no call/no show"" policy, I would not be allowed to reschedule with them... EVER. I asked if she meant that literally forever, I would not be able to make an appointment even though they had ALL of my medical records as well as the referral from my PCP, and I was told ""unfortunately yes, due to their policy, I could no longer schedule an appointment"". I  asked about exceptions due to accidents or deaths in the family and was told that it didn't matter. A no call was a no call, period. Clearly they don't care about the well-being of their community. Absolute garbage.|I have been a patient of doctor rosen blooms well over 15 years at 1st they over prescribe me now because of the government they say they have to take it down about 95% which I agreed to he also told me to get out of my  relationship that that was caused me my home and my child.  Dr.Rosenblum told me if I didn't move out in the next 3 months he would Cut me off of all my pain pills .
I said I cant do that due to zero money . I said I was going to leave after my daughter graduated only 6months from then.  Dr.rosenblum said, I don't care what you have to do but get out within 3 months or I will cut you off all of your pain pills.  I was so stressed so scared of being in pain I did what was asked of me.  When I left I didn't know what or how I would find a place where my daughter and I could go. I lost my beautiful home and my daughter wanted to finish high school with all of her friends.  Had I known the out come doing this, I would have slit my wrist 1st be  fore leaving my living situation.  I would have gone through the withdrawals. Because I did what he asked  , I went from living in a beautiful home living with my daughter and all my animals to living in a 5th wheel.  After all my bills are paid each month I get $100. A week for gas and food and what ever.
There were times I waited hours for Dr.Rosenblum .
I've never missed an appointment , there has been times when he asked me to move my appointments for him , I did .
Along with the government is stepping in and making sure all pain patients need to be at a 80% or 95% lower level.  I have been making steps towards these requirements.
Some time after Dr.rosenblum forced me to change my living situation he put me under the care of his PA-C  Shea DeKlotz .
They continue to charge me with his same  billing rates quite a bit more than if I had gone to a nother office I would have been billed a lot less than the rates of  Anastiya Z ologist well well into his years of being a doctor she is clearly just been that a school. Now I am being charged his rates for a student , Basically doing what he told her. She didn't even have to think she just prescribe pills.
. To day I was late , very late 20 minutes past my wiggle room.  30 minutes past my regular time. I had called ahead 40 minutes  before and explained that I was indeed going to be late. I said is there any chance of Shea giving me a script  that would hold me over the weekend? At 1st they thought that was a ok thing.  After drove another 35 minutes in traffic they said Nope that shea couldn't do this for me . I couldn't believe it . She was still in the office and her Last patient left when I was still in the office.  They felt it was easier for them to  Prescribe me drugs that would help me through withdrawals I explained to them I didn't wanna do that in a scared me to death in could they please just give me enough to hold me over they wouldn't there was no sympathy. I went out in the hallway to regain my  Composer and they locked up shop well before 5 o'clock and I saw Shae and she didn't even look at me Or apologize I thought it was cruel ,I thought it was rude , I felt like she was pulling a power Trip . I would not wish withdraws on anybody.  The gal at the desk said,  it was easy for her to go through withdrawals that she her self had gone through it several times. She said it was no big deal.  Ok so no big deal going through with drawls and now along with these with drawls now I wasn't going to get any pain relief along side of that .
I think  what Shea asked me to go through was CRUEL BORTING ON
BARBARIC PUNISHMENT.
I think I was being picked on and Bullied.  I wish I could find a way to get out of this.  Today is Thursday, I think they could have done more for me .|I feel like I have received quality care from responsible professionals who genuinely care for my overall health and well being.  The truth is they are not there to fix you... they are there to help you manage your pain to a more tolerable level so you can have a better quality of life.  I would recommend trying whatever treatments are available to fix your underlying health issues, if possible.  If that did not work, I know It can be hard to accept that one's pain may not go away.  Some people do have more successs with varying treatments than others.  The lucky people don't need to visit a pain management specialist.  For the rest of us, we need to make the best of a bad situation.  Going into the clinic (or evaluating the practice),  I think one needs to understand they have a tough job.  With so many potential drug seekers, politics, regulations, and personal Ethics, one must understand there is a required protocol to ensure the proper care is given to their target audience.  I know how hard it can be to be patient when in extreme pain; however, stick with the process, communicate honestly and openly, and be open to their recommendations, and they will undoubtedly do their best to give you the best quality of life.  How that happens may or may not be different than what you had in mind.  Remember: They are the experts in the field and have good intentions -- trust them. Focus on being a good patient and take a level of ownership in your care and you will be in a best-case scenario.  People, situations, and companies are not perfect -- but, life can still be enjoyable and there are people who want to help you.  You just have to put yourself in position to let them.  Good luck!|These folks are beyond patient and deserving of recognition and respect especially as they're managing a very difficult form of care in a presently hostile environment. Last week I added to their stress and am absolutely embarrassed to admit this. We were at one of my specialists up toward Seattle and waiting for test results so treatment could be discussed and no one could figure out where the results were- i had one group of medical people barking at me (up north) and I was calling everyone in an attempt to find the results, no one was sure what was going on...and because the scan was originally requested from OIPC i melted down all over them, behaving like a 2 year old...as it turned out the error was at our internal medicine practice, near where we live, and they sent one set of info to the wrong place and also lost my bloodwork. Add to this a sick dog at home (ruined 3 rugs and neither of us slept last week, he had to he taken out nearly every hour) and we're in the middle of my husband's ongoing health crisis, I snapped and lost it, behaving like an A-hole. And yet they remained patient.

The last 2 weeks she really went to bat for me with my insurance company. I know she went way above and way beyond what is required of her as a MA. I can not say enough good things about this angel. When you take medicine that you need to function like a normal human, and insurance is charging you almost $1000 for a month supply, your world is a little rocked, when you can no way pay that much monthly. I hope she gets an award, or a raise or both. Thank you Jaime!|After reading some of the reviews on other sites I'll admit I was a bit skeptical to come here. After my first visit I can't say that I mirror all the negative reviews as my experience went smoothly and without complication. I was referred by my PCP (yes, they require a referral) without any questions and was able to schedule my initial appointment within 4 weeks.

First off, it should be known that Oregon insurance policies suck, especially their Medicaid plans. I came back to Portland in early 2018 after living in California for several years. Medicaid (Medi-Cal) in California is amazing by comparison. OHP CareOregon is extremely limiting and often with long wait times for referral approvals, the other Medicaid programs like Providence and Kaiser are even worse. There is also some misinformation floating around about OHP, that they don't cover pain medications, when they actually do, just not all types, it depends on your diagnosis and where it falls into their priority list, so it must meet particular criteria to be covered, you can actually discuss this with CareOregon's pharmacy department. This Legacy center is the only pain clinic I know of that actually writes prescriptions (aside from your PCP), OHSU and Providence clinics do not unless you have a terminal illness. Way different than California.

The office is clean and the waiting area was dimly lit with only a couple of other people waiting. I was seen about 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment time, and was then seen about another 10 minutes after being checked in by the nurse. My condition is well documented over 3+ years, legitimate and currently requires ongoing pain medications. Dr. Schrattenholzer spent over an hour with me and was kind and polite the whole time. He was genuinely interested and perplexed by my condition and wanted to offer me the best options. At no time did he seem condescending, rude or treat me like I was an addict. We discussed alternate forms and possibilities of treatment and various medications and decided to go with a couple of prescription medications that would best suit me for the time being with the option to try other medications for long-term use. They wrote the prescriptions, did the pre-authorizations for insurance and sent me on my way. Scheduled a follow up for a couple months out. They also have an onsite Physical Therapist consultant and Pain Psychologist, who you don't actually need to participate with if you don't want to, just an option.

Highlights:
- Free parking, you'll need a validation slip. Building #3 is easiest. The main entrance is on NW Marshall. Oddly, the disabled parking spots are all on the roof level, which means if it's raining you're going to get soaked. There's another entrance on NW Northrup, I believe there are disabled spots on the lower level that are covered. The parking garages can get jammed during peak hours.
- Entrance to the building offices are on the upper and lower floors, the other elevators in the garage take you to those levels.
- Bathrooms near entry ways.
- Pain clinic is just a couple doors down on the left if entering from the roof of building 3, level D. If you park in building 2 it's the first door on the right after crossing the sky bridge.
- There's filtered water in the waiting area.
- There's also a bathroom in the offices just past the reception desk.
- The doctors schedule can be quite full, so scheduling can be a little hit or miss. There are other doctors there as well.|I have nothing but a great experience at the pain clinic. I have suffered from chronic pain my whole life. I have had a few accidents that have caused C7 vertebrae some problems and it affects my right arm. I also have Fibromyalgia, arthritis, and a bad back. I am 52 and have tried many things to help with all my pains. Going to PT's that don't understand chronic pain or doctors that think you are faking it to get the meds. I can't take half the meds out there because I am allergic to all of them. Here they listen and start out slow to help build up and find a pace to go so you don't flair up and feel defeated. So many place do that not understanding. Here I feel understood. They use everyday language and not doctor talk so you understand what they are saying. I also like that since I have learning challenges. I leave an appointment feeling confident and understood. It is not often as a chronic pain sufferer that you get that with doctors or PT.|My son was in a car wreck 6 months ago. After he came out of his first opointment I had never seen him like that, DR Price refused to look at his neck dispite him asking her several times. All she did was show him xrays and told him she is not interested in prescribing his pain meds. He is on a low dose but it was enough to get him out of bed. He told me he is done trying to get better and the clinic made him feel like he was a druggy. After looking at all these bad reviews and talking to my son I dont recomend this clinic to anyone.|BAD MISTREATMENT OF PATIENTS!!!

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

Was Sent there to get help to "" Manage my Pain"",,,
They/She/it. ""Managed"" to stress me out enough to put me in MORE PAIN!!!

THERE IS SOME SICK, TWISTED, UNEDUCATED DIMRODS HERE THAT THEY  TRY TO PUT A DR TAG ON!!!
START WITH PRICE,,,,
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS WRONG WITH HER?
SHE DOESNT KNOW A REAL PATIENT FROM A FRAUD,,,  UP AND WALKED OUT AFTER PRETTY MUCH CALLING US LIARS,,,
I NEVER FELT THAT WAY FROM A DOCTOR VISIT..,
Was a strange Visit, She basically kicked us out, showed us the Exit. Because I Laughed at her Stupidity... she spent 30min talking about a blow dryer??? Tried to Tell me that acupuncture would fix me?
SHE IS DANGEROUS,,,
I Have Photopenina from Radiation Damage, Among  other things, that burning incense and candles won't quite cut.
Just out in Left Field!!!
I Won't Be Back to this place.
She is a Loon & Should not be Allowed to Practice in ANY MEDICAL FIELD,,,,,

Legacy,
You are Better Then This!
Coming From,
A 61 year old patient with radiation damage after a Brain Tumor, Craniotomy for Correction, following Radiation damage
21 years Ago,,,,, that Legacy is Responsible for.

Go to an office in Hopes of some relief,
To then be Treated like a Criminal or Crazy Person!!!!

Look at all the Bad Reviews,,,,,
Why should patients go through this?

Never in my Life,,, What got me is the way I feel after fighting this for So Long,,,,

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH.

Wish they could Feel My Pain, They would never doubt anyone Again.

SOMETHING HAS TO BE SAID AND DONE.

The Patient should be First!!!

Thanx,|Well, I would say that, barring any other reason, I have not received timely calls or emails back at all from Simon Klein, the Social Worker in the clinic. He is nice, but appears to be overwhelmed and it makes me nervous handing my life over to medical professionals who do not embrace the gravity of your situation being life vs. death. Also, being a terminal cancer patient, I'm not sure I should be doing this at all. I was heavily coerced to try this clinic again after a completely monstrous disaster about 10 years ago. That doctor is now the clinic director who supposedly my new doctor here, Dr. Price, is not controlled by in any way. I have come to realize through in person visits lately that my PCP may just be wanted to end his responsibility to my treatment, and with my pain medications, with everything. He writes things that are flowery, because they are in print. In person, he can be very cruel. It puts someone like me in a very hard position. Will I actually be one of the people out there with fibromyalgia, Stage IV Cancer that is terminal (slowly-but still terminal) and very aggressive pain neuropathy throughout my body (especial arms and hands). Will I be someone who is on disability and receives Medicare benefits, and has never, ever not followed my doctors instructions to the letter and point (with urinalysis reports to prove this, if need be) and still end up looking for relief for my pain. The only reason I came here was when my PCP was still being nice to me and begging me to try it. I trusted him, and that is exactly when he became very cold, and truly cruel at in person appointments. He is not able to be judged by what he does in private. His actions are not available to anyone but me. Dr. Price at this clinic seems very nice, but also quite clinical with point by point charts that are complex and I don't get any personal answers about how this change to the new wonder drug Suboxone will work for me, and if it doesn't work is a question that is simply not answered by anyone. When I asked my PCP, who referred me to this clinic if he would treat me, let me receive my original working treatment, if this program didn't work or the new drug didn't work, and he said:
""Absolutely NOT."" I am being turned away in my time of need and asked to begin a program which I have bad communication from it's staff Social Worker who seem to only get connected with if he accidentally answers his phone without looking. (This is after 3 or more voice mails and hand written messages being passed to him through the front desk.) Also, email seems to be the achilles heel for all doctors at Legacy. They encourage the use of it and then are upset when you do use it. It's a strange position to be in and I wanted to make it public because with all of my insurance and being an educated individual who enjoyed a very full life until I had a cycling accident that nearly killed me, left me with a LOT of lifetime pain to deal with and then a terminal Cancer diagnosis and that came with a surgery and chemotherapy, which has forever long reaching side effects that are completely pain inducing. I honestly do not know how much time I have left, and neither does anyone else. Because I have insurance and good attitude people think you are fine and do not need medical care. But, the only reason I have been doing so well is BECAUSE of the good medical care I've received up to this point. Now, I honestly do not know what to do. I am completely uncomfortable being treated by my PCP of 15 years, also a Legacy doctor (I started with him before he was with Legacy...) and while I am okay moving forward with this pain clinic and new drug, I wish the Social Worker and doctor were more communicative. Or communicative at all, sometimes. I truly believe the downturn in my relationship with my PCP came with Legacy wanting to not provide pain medication at all, like so many doctors are doing now. I am hoping that I can find a new PCP within a system that this Pain Clinic will work with as I am very uncomfortable having any more sessions with my current PCP.|Weeks trying to get appointment scheduled. Finally did after they canceled and changed many appointments. Dr told me I needed a lumbar flexion and extension X-ray. She said I could go to any Legacy center. Went to Mt hood legacy today . She didn't submit the order. So tried calling the office. Got voicemail. Employee there tried several times to get ahold of them. Talked to a person once but kept getting back to voicemail. 2 hours of a waste of time! People at Legacy Mt Hood were great but they're hands were tied. Don't recommend this place at all!!!|DR. Schrattenholzer was the answer to my prayers, I in a wheelchair, suffering horribly, could barely breathe without back pain, let alone move. But Dr. Scrattenholzer was able to pretty much relieve all my pain, either through injections/radial ablation/ and medication, I have not needed any help walking, I'm extremely grateful for Dr. Scrattenholzer, he Saw me at my worst and was still kind and caring not to mention he was still willing to help me, and I thank God every day for him and his help ! He did something for me I can never repay , except to say Thank you from the bottom of my heart , and to write this review and tell everyone how much he helped me and he's one of the best doctors I have ever seen.

From the beginning, Dr. Kaur was compassionate w/out being patronizing.  She managed my pain meds for about 2 years before my insurance changed.  Then I went back to her in 2015, once our insurance changed back.
I am happy to say that through her care, I was able to keep up with my toddlers until I could successfully get a total hip replacement.  As of 4/2023, I am off of the pain meds, and so happy Dr. Kaur was there to assist me.  Highly recommend!!|My initial experience was a positive one. The physician assistant Nadine was the most helpful person in my pain condition.  However I had some insurance limitations so procedures were sort of off the table. I went through a couple of medication switches  and after about the third one I was suddenly told very abruptly that I can no longer be treated by them. They refused to taper me off of opioid pain medication that I've been on for over three years. This sort of mistreatment should be considered malpractice. Horrible horrible clinic.|I have been seeing Dr. Jayaram for a few years now and he has been great.  He is no nonsense and has fought hard with my insurance company to get alternative procedures approved for me. The most recent they had been trying to deny for 16 months and he kept on them until they finally approved it.  I would definitely recommend seeing him, he is the first doc I've had in awhile that actually listens to me instead of making assumptions like most doctors|I was with Pain Management for 2+ years (specifically with Dr. Jayaram) and seemed to like the office staff.  Although, I seemed to get a new staff member at every appointment.  There seemed  to be a huge turnover which tells me that the doctors don't now how to run a practice.  Which brings me to this subject, I had done everything that the doctors asked, always made my appointments, passed UA's, paid my bills and did what was asked of me per the contract that I had signed.  I met Becky on my first ablation procedure and fell in love.  She was so helpful and professional.  With that being said, after a year of going to the office I asked her out.  We kept it very professional for a year.  When she gave the doctors 6 weeks notice to leave the practice as we were moving  I received a letter stating Dr. Jayaram could no longer be my doctor.  I was shocked that I had done nothing wrong, hadn't violated my contract, and even had a surgery for a Spinal cord stimulator scheduled.  The appointments were canceled and when I called to find out what was going on NO ONE could call me back. I did't realize I was dealing with a child.  He realized I wasn't going to play ball so he took his ball home.   It was very unprofessional!  When you are dealing with a patients well being it is professional not personal.  He took an oath to help people  and provide medical service but yet his personal vendetta influenced his professionalism.  Given the revolving door of employees and how he treated me as a patient speaks volumes on his character and how he treats his employees.  Becky had been a dedicated employee for over 17 years and he couldn't even wish her well and thank her for all of her years of service.  Think twice before making an appointment to be treated by this physician or his office.  Apparently, I have to give one star just to post this review.  I would give zero stars for the way I was treated.",2025-02-24|2024-12-15|2024-12-30|2024-06-03|2024-01-12|2017-02-22|2022-05-02|2019-12-10,5|5|5|1|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJI0R4vEQJlVQRB7w9GmIhx4s,30

Also five stars for the first treatment -- a temporary nerve block -- of that condition.

For many months prior to the nerve block, I experienced extreme discomfort when standing or walking for more than a few minutes.  My treatment was at 9:00 AM on a Wednesday.  That same day I was able to complete three sets of standing exercises -- a ten minute walk on a treadmill and performing two Tai Chi programs, totaling about 30 minutes -- all without any significant discomfort.

I had been informed that this first treatment was diagnostic, and the benefit would be temporary.  The pain relief lasted throughout Wednesday afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning the pain returned.

The treatment plan calls for one more temporary block, an evaluation of results, and a decision whether to proceed with a longer lasting block.

Throughout my initial consultations and treatment, Dr. Phillips and his staff have been thorough, professional, and personable.  The facilities are modern, spacious, and immaculately clean.

So far, so good.

I want to leave this review for all other parts/persons at Portland Pain Care. They are fantastic thus the 5 star review. Dr Stapleton is so very dedicated to his patients and his work. He is always so thorough with each patient. Before any procedure, he personally comes out to make sure we understand what he will be doing and the location. The care by the nurses both before and after the procedures is also so amazing. They do all they can to make your visit comfortable and they are always in such good moods which is soothing as a patient. Empathy and compassion are so evident in Dr Stapleton, his nurses and all personal at the surgery center. He must be a great interviewer because in my opinion, he has highly qualified and exceptionally enthusiastic, compassionate personnel working there. I feel so lucky  that I am a patient at Portland Pain because it is so obvious they care about my well being. They listen attentively and are so good at helping me hear. I am very very hearing impaired and I never even have to ask them to slow down or speak loudly anymore. They know my needs and they address them so well. I imagine they know what every patient needs because they are truly good listeners and they want to help. I never feel hurried to quickly exit so another patient can come in. They want me to feel very sure that I am able and ready to walk out. They even walk me to the door. If you are in need of an excellent pain care facility, look no further. Portland Pain Care is the best in my opinion, and I have been to many others so I know good pain care!|Staff at his Johnson Creek office are absolutely wonderful. NP Barb and Nurse Angela always welcome you with smile. They both have very warm personalities and patiently answer all questions.
At the East Portland Surgical Center, the staff is equally warm and welcoming. I've had several different nurses and they are all very friendly.
Dr. Stapleton has great bedside manners and makes his rounds to talk to all his patients before their procedures. He makes sure you understand your procedure and answers all questions. He and his staff have worked very closely with my neurosurgeon, to find the best ways to manage my pain levels.
His staff schedules appointments in a very timely manner, realizing that alleviating someone's pain is important. They also return calls in a timely manner. I would recommend Dr. Stapleton to anyone considering pain management.|Dr Stapleton is top-notch. He has a calming voice and charming presence. He does all the procedures.

However, whether it's the doctor or other staff I'm not sure, but I feel that during the pre appointments I'm not listened to. Those appointments are short (15 min) and not enough time for discussion or questions. Because of this, I did not get the source of my pain addressed immediately but when I finally did, relief was complete.|My patient was referred to this clinic. He is arguably not the easiest patient due to Alzheimer's, but their staff was not helpful, understanding, accommodating or supportive. They treated him like a second class citizen. They were audibly and visibly annoyed, short, and frustrated when describing his concerns. In my follow up, they were degrading, rude, and argumentative. I will not refer any other patients to this clinic nor will this patient be returning.|I have been under Dr. Stapleton's for several years now and has included several injections as well as constant pain management. I have had telehealth as well as in office visits with the absolute best Hillsboro personnel including Danylyn as well as office personnel Always 100% personal and professional and helpful help. I could not possibly have had any better care controlling my constant pain. Dr. Stapleton has always been the most knowledgeable professional and patient doctor I've ever experienced. I've experienced always in both Hillsboro as well as Wilsonville, the most courteous and professional as well as understanding and empathetic help in all aspects of all visits.|From my first contact with Dr Stapleton's office, I was at ease.  When I arrived for my appointment, I rode the elevator with a lady who I could tell worked in the building.   She was very pleasant and then I discovered she worked in the office.  As I entered the office I was immediately greeted by the ""superstar"".    I was seen timely by Barb.  I was nervous.  Barb went through her questions to me with kindness and compassion.  She was so thorough in telling me what to expect, I  had no questions left.   Mary got the approval from insurance and had me scheduled with an appointment for my procedure.   Every person I came in contact with in this office treated me amazing.

Thank you, Melissa, for my introduction to yoga and thank you, Erica, for showing me the various ways to manage my pain, think about it differently, and live a fuller life.

I thank you so much!|If I could give them negative stars I would. There ""therapy"" is a joke the Dr.s there don't really know what they are talking about and are a bunch of frauds.  I just got a call from my PCP that they just got a call from Dr Steven Tackett Nelson and that he is wanting to change my medication because I'm severely depressed and that I'm going to hurt myself or someone else. I have never spoken to or seen this doctor but it turns out that he is one of the psychiatrists that works at Midvalley pain. So in short do not go here they are a joke and I would not recommend seeing this doctor out side of this practice either because you never know what he will do. And I'm going to be filing a complaint with the State of Oregon Medical Board for both Midvalley Pain and especially for ""Dr. Steven Tackett Nelson""|This place is metaphysical hell. The 'orientation' that takes 2 hours involves a powerpoint presentation that illustrates the opinion that 3-6 months after an injury it should be completely healed and therefore any pain associated is all mental. There are NO MEDICAL DOCTORS that work in or with this office, nor can this office reccomend, authorize or perform any medical procedures. They provide a one size fits most approach encompassed in a 10 week GROUP THERAPY clinic where you do yoga, cuddle with service dogs and attend cognitive therapy (counseling). The only thing this place lacks was some asshat 'shaman' burning sage, waving about their magic vibrating crystal wand and preaching the gospel of magnetic bracelets.|As a mental health professional, I have worked with Dr. Brillhart, a brilliant and empathic clinician.

Michael H.
Salem, Oregon|This Facility Is A Joke.

Furthermore, the clinicians that work here are highly unethical.  I caught them trying to manipulate me, and they even admitted to it!  They refused me access to their program to benefit their own adgenda, and tried to spin it, so it appeared like it was my idea, and my fault also. I have been severely injured, I have been traumatized, and I have done absolutley nothing to warrant their actions.  I came to these people with severe pain, an open mind, and I asked them for help.  They abandoned me and tried to slander my character!   These people are liars do not trust them, they don't care about helping you.  I am an innocent victim who has done nothing, why are they blaming me?

At the first class, they make you watch random youtube videos that are not even theirs, they are charging people to watch something you can watch at home for free?? The video, (and the music) was so stupid that at break time, i just got up and left.  I called and apologized for leaving and said i did not think the time was right for me to be in the program.   About a year later I had a new Dr. and he referred me to the program again.  (I have had a half dozen specialists refer me here in the meantime.)  I had been to a lot of counseling inbetween, and I felt I wanted give it another try.

My 2nd assessment with Erika was both laughable and shameful .  She tried to manipulate me and treated me like a child.  Repeating multiple times.. ""You didn't think our program was right for you before"" and then she mentioned my folder? She said. ""You brought this folder in with you.""  (The folder contained legal documents that prove I have been malpracticed.)
She did not even ask what was in the folder.  She was happier to use it as an excuse to refuse me access to the program.  This seems like an extremely close minded approach for a trained professional?

After she wasted my time for 30 minutes, I simply told Erika,  ""Look, it sounds to me like YOU'RE the one who dosen't  think the program is right for me, but you're trying to make it out to sound like,  I'M the one, who dosen't want to be in the program.  I also told her at that time that, I had a 141 IQ, and I knew when people were lying to me...

So then,  she actually admitted to it!! Erika said,  "" OK, well, actually, yeah, I'LL BE HONEST,  I dont think that our program is right for you.""!

Why did it take her 1/2 hour, and why did I have to catch her lying, for her to be honest?  It's because these loosers have their own adgenda.  They don't want me in their group because they don't want me talking about how I was malpracticed and undermining the doctors authority.

This is highly, highly corrupt and unethical behavior..  I have been severely traumatized, and these amatures are only traumatizing me further with their game playing.

I requested another consultation with a different intake person, and they had me meet with their 2 psychiatrists.  The lady was about 350 pounds.  I'm sorry, but I don't need advice from someone who isn't even smart enough to know when it's time to stop eating.  The other one, said 10 times, ""I shoot from the hip, I shoot from the hip.""  I said ""Me too, and if you don't let me in the program, I'm going on google and I will leave a review that thoroughly outlines your highly unethical behavior.""  Their reply was that, now they weren't going to let me into the program because I had made threats. HU??

These people are worthless, they also heavily misrepresented the facts when they called my PCP and tried to slander me, more blameshifting..  The morning of this appt, I got up early and started calling them at 8am because I did not know the exact time of my visit, and I did not want to miss it or be late.

I had to call 13 times before they finally decided to answer their phone that morning.

So, they called my Dr. and told him I called 13 times and I was phsycotic?

The people here clearly do not have much faith in their own abilities, if they need to lie, manipulate, slander, and refuse treatment when a difficult case comes along!

Over the past few months she has included the shockwave treatment. I can't believe how much better I feel. Now I can go on runs without paying in pain. I can sit comfortably at the computer for as long as I need and I can use my shoulders without pain. 5 stars!|I was treated with the Shockwave by Dr. Levy. Ironically, there was no shock involved, only relief!  In my experience it helped dissolve a painful ovarian cyst. In particular I believe that having frequent treatments in a two week period made a tremendous difference. I was dealing with debilitating symptoms for about three months and considering surgery. I would also note that I was taking NAC as well and strongly believe that that combined with shockwave saved me from surgery or a burst cyst. I also can't say enough about Dr. Levy's ability to assess a patient's need and treat in a way with genuine care. On a another note, the treatments also had an immediate effect of reducing the intensity of the symptoms-so it was a good form of pain relief n the moment as well.|I had multiple ankle fractures along with ankle surgery to implant hardware about a year and a half ago and since then I've had persistent swelling and pain that would inhibit movement in the injured area and lead to plateaus in physical therapy. It wasn't until I added Shockwave treatments that I started to see consistent relief in the pain and swelling thus leading to significant gains from PT. It was so exciting to feel the pain start to go way after the first and second treatments and to be able to see chronic inflammation and swelling in the joint go down so I could move into more functional ranges of motion.

Pain PDX is an informed and welcoming option for Shockwave treatment for pain relief in Portland, Oregon. Highly recommend trying them to see if you can get pain relief too!|I am so impressed with Shock Wave treatment. After my first experience, I could feel an immediate response.
I've suffered from foot pain for years.
Now, having had 5+ treatments, I can honestly say this thing is doing miraculous work! I have been telling everyone about it.
If given the opportunity to try Shock Wave for pain management, give it a go.
It can be seriously life changing.
Thank you Dr. Levy!|Two decades of doing hair has left me with a body that perplexes a lot of chiropractors and care providers. I often hear I have the most hyper extended knees that they have ever seen and in turn people don't want the risk of messing with or trying to treat them. I can honestly say that I have had the exact opposite situation happen with Dr. Suzi Levy.

My knee was at a point where doing a physical daily job while also living in a fat body and also partaking in very recreational activities such as hiking, traveling, city walking, doing a single flight of stairs, sitting for long road trips, or even having a lazy Sunday couch day were not things that could  ever happen together. I was using lidocaine spray at minimum 2-3 times a day, and it didn't matter how I shifted my knee, or propped it up, or babied it, the concern of surgery was ever present. And we both had decided honestly I was too young for this route, and would make me less viable for future surgery's when I was older, which was also scary. Even after attempting rounds of PT and work directly on that spot, I was ready to throw in the towel and give up so much of my lifestyle and with such constant and chronic pain, I would have done anything to get some relief.

When Dr. Suzi suggested that this shockwave therapy could be an option for me, I was curious, nervous and honestly pretty skeptical. It's been such an interesting and very gratifying journey watching my body heal itself and being presented with a surgery alternative that was actually working. I almost couldn't believe it!

The sensation in the pulsewave machine was not invasive feeling and Dr. Levy was so awesome at constantly checking in with pain levels as we worked on the front and backs of both of my knees. Within just a few treatment appointments, which were also so quick and worked great with my busy schedule, I am not kidding when I say my life has changed for the better! When you are in a cloud of constant chronic pain, it becomes such a part of your daily life, that you just kinda learn how to sit with it, accept it, baby it and give up so much joy around things you were once able to do!

She has called my case a very difficult one in terms of not hyping up how much ease of pain we may have gotten, but I am down to using lidocaine as a preventative measure when doing very long and uphill hikes. Which is mind blowing!! Hiking 5-10 miles that involve uphill switchbacks, tree root systems and cases of stairs in one hike was something I thought I would never be able to do again, and I am back to doing them regularly! I am still being very mindful and slow and steady, using a hiking pole and taking breaks, but I am not in pain while doing so which is still constantly such a gift!!!

I am also back to working 45-60 hours weekly on my feet, standing and bending in weird ways, and where as again, I am aware and still being mindful, I am able to not even think about my knee anymore while doing my job!

This treatment has given me back so much of my joy of life and in my job! Makes me feel like I can continue in my lifestyle and career for more decades to come! Thank you for creating such a space of care and opportunity for such a huge gift to myself. I am so thankful for the opportunity to keep on living such a busy lifestyle and experience fulfilling adventures without pain!! You changed my life Dr. Suzi!! Thank you so kindly from the bottom of my heart!!|My Shockwave experience at Pain PDX was great! I've had plantarfascitis for 10 years. Tried everything: physical therapy, special inserts, tape jobs, anti inflammatories, massage, chiropractic. No matter what it still got worse. I felt helpless and scared. I love nature and hiking, but I couldn't even do a long shopping trip without consequence, let alone hike.

Dr. Levy suggested I try the Shockwave and the next morning I was able to get out of bed with no foot pain!

6 visits and 2 months later, I'm able to do day-to-day activities comfortably.

She recited what she was supposed to tell me. I was having an awful pain. That was the last day I visited the clinic.|The NW Pain staff and doctors are great at what they do.

I was accused of being dishonest from the get go.  I was never dishonest in any of my answers. I went there for help and instead was accused of lying. I am not a liar! His bedside manner could definitely use some work and maybe even a little kindness and understanding of the patients that actually need help! I do not recommend this dr to anyone ever!|Avoid this place! I was referred by my spinal surgeon for ""diagnostic"" reasons but never received any pain relief. After getting my 2nd nerve block there I had a stroke 2 weeks later in my cerebellum, right where the nerve block had been injected. It had punctured an artery in the back of my head causing a dissection and stroke. Now while I can't prove that this was the cause 'legally', I know it was the cause because as soon as I left that office after the nerve block, I was in excruciating pain that continued to get worse. I was unable to sleep on my back or rest the back of my head on anything for over a month because of the extreme pain. When I called their office to let them know the problems I was having they told me not to worry about it unless there was redness and swelling at the injection site which was impossible to tell since it was in the back of my hairline. So 2 weeks later, at 43 I had a stroke and I blame this place completely. I just want to warn other people. This place is not a professional medical establishment and they do not  have a caring sense or compassion. It is not about helping people it's about making money. I wish I had never been sent here. Needless to say I was not able to get my neck surgery due to the stroke so I'm now finding a new spinal surgeon who hopefully won't send me to a horrible place like this. You have been warned!!!|I recently started going to the Forest Grove office of Northwest Pain Institute.

If you are an internal medicine/immune disorder pt. this is not the clinic for you. I was referred here by my PCP, I asked before I made the appointment if they treated people with they type of needs I have, I was told yes. In person, after an hour+ drive and a missed 1/2 day of work I was told no. Unsurprisingly, since my primary complaint is an ""invisible illness"" they will not treat me here. Immune disorders and their related problems don't seem to be taken seriously anymore. There is no expiration date, they can't be exercised away, physical therapied away, or thought away using positive thinking, and because of this, legitimate pain isn't taken seriously or treated like it should be. The other troublesome part of this is that I said my main complaint is X and because of X I also have Y and Z. When they called me to tell me it was a no for tx, they said they couldn't treat me because of Z. On the scale of things, symptom Z is only there because of problem X.

The first series was just over a year ago and the procedures were successful in greatly reducing nerve pain in my low back, hips and sides. As he recommended previously, I have also continued to do daily PT exercises intended specifically to strengthen core and glute support for my spine, which has enabled more physical activities beyond just walking. I think he is the best in his field, and is a perfectionist in his work. I highly recommend him and his very professional and knowledgeable staff; some have worked with him for 10-15 years, that says a lot about who Dr Moore is. It all started with an appt to see and discuss my xrays and MRI with him, so I understood what was causing all the pain and get his opinions and recommendations.|Running little late but to be expected. Trust Dr. Moore to offer best solutions to conditions. Epidermal ordered STAT. I hope this works. Next visit want to speak with Dr. Moore about non surgical alternatives to pain management. Thee is a lot of info in the patient waiting room I wish I would have taken photo of as reminders to ask him about.|Highly recommend Dr. Moore and any person he decides to train. Stellar group. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my spine care.

I have a chronic, long term spine injury that happened in my early 30's. As I age (mid 50's now), typical changes occur, but nerve pain and spasms foster further injury for me.

Dr. Moore and his team (I have worked with all of them over a number of years) are top tier problem solvers, with real solutions that help me keep walking, while enjoying as normal a life as possible. They always find a way to help me, alleviate my worst discomfort, and to be my best self.

Quality care starts with a quality team, and you will not find better than Dr. Moore .

Liz|I have been seeing Dr. Moore for a number of years. Dr. Moore is very knowledgeable about my problem and has tried a number of procedures to give me some pain relief-lower lumbar region. Unfortunately, though these procedures worked for other patients, they did not for me. I do enjoy discussing my problem with Dr. Moore since I think he is caring and sincerely wanting to help.

I was reading other sites set to review doctors and clincs. This Dr. Coelho has over 80 1 star reviews says he diagnosis everyone with fibromyalgia leaving them crying leaving the appointment. I went to administration of this clinic and wasn't taken seriously as to how terrible this doctor is but he left notes that I have issues because of how he was acting? If you want belittled, mistreated, gaslit on medical files. Skip this clinic at all costs!  This was only a intake! He's a disaster!

I have a degenerate disease, he question my diagnosis. Gaslit me then laughed at me saying I'm dramatic that I have pain at my age. Might be a good place if you want an anxiety med for pain management and a doctor with humiliating bed side manner. Dr didn't listen spoke over me invalidated all of my concerns and health issues. Dr Coelho has absolutely humiliated me, raised his voice and demanded I go to a clinic that doesn't exsist then put in my chart notes that I made up my condition causing issues in the future for my care.

I am currently undergoing injections, which they had to fight my insurance to get. The injection caused me more severe pain for 10 ish days and then I was back to my baseline. I was being treated with a prescription to help the pain which at least let me do a little more than I can do now. However I was cut off a few months ago because I have OHP. I understand their reasons behind it, however it makes me feel like I am not worthy of help due to having state insurance. I am currently not able to work so I have to rely on help from the state at the moment. It just does not seem right to have to be in pain if you are lower in society. But like I said, I am grateful for what they had done.
Update: I am changing my review to a five star review. I had to call them today regarding paperwork that was sent to them that I needed returned. They are always on top of everything and I appreciate that they don't make me feel stupid or invalid. Thank you Danny (front desk) for your help!|I had issues of finding spine care due to my color.  I found Dr. Anthony and yall clinic.  Dr. Anthony was an absolutely the best , kind, caring an explained everything clearly.  I thank my Lord Jesus Christ   for letting me find Dr. Anthony and he has a wonderful staff. I want to thank Leslie for being kind when preparing me for surgery.  Thank you Dr. Anthony from the bottom of my heart|Clinic should call before if they can't take ohp for back pain.  Complete waste of time and gas.  60 miles one way.  They only wanted to bill ohp for new patient visit for the money. Thats why they didn't call to explain coverage.  OHP only works for hip and knees.  Yet this is a spine clinic that works on back issues.  If you have OHP this is not for you

I think they should send gift card for the extended travel time and more wasting my time|Dr. Anthony is great. Very personable and knowledgeable on the processes and procedures he does. The injections I've had here and the appointments I've had follow industry best practices and all injections are ultrasound guided. The clinic staff have even been helpful and knowledgeable when discussing the insurance and workers comp process. Very nice people and very good service. Highly recommend.|Dr. Oleg isn't just another cog in the healthcare system! He genuinely cares and is an advocate for us little guys.  Pain changed my life and his willingness to fight for me gives hope in an often hopeless battle with the healthcare and insurance system.

He's got a pretty fantastic team too! Give em a call and see for yourself!|My experience here has been pleasant. I've had injections done elsewhere that were painful and didn't work - not the case here!|Doctor was beyond rude. As I'm trying to show him my reports that show I have pinched nerves from an actual doctor at a chiropractor clinic he completely dismissed me and said those aren't real reports to have more studies done, as I'm telling him he doesn't have my current studies he's looking at old ones. He argued with me unprofessionally as I'm trying to explain my pain to him and he wouldn't even listen. Do not recommend.|This would be a 5 star review for doctors & NP they have all been great in the last 5 years going there I have never been humiliated like I was today by the guy at reception he's always been abrupt & slightly rude but today I mentioned I would not be at next appointment as I will be out of town & already worked it out with NP (Nickiel....spelling)she is also very knowledgeable, he still insisted I tell him where & what day I was leaving & what day to be back I didn't see why he needed to know but did give him the information.  As I was leaving he asked me to talk to him. He loudly stated that my doctor had no authority to make such a decision about me not having an extra appointment before I left. Had he not been so arrogant, loud, & rude telling a very full waiting room about my medical issues which I'm sure they all assumed I was a druggie trying to scam them. Had he been polite & kept the conversation quiet I would have not had a problem setting an extra appointment even if it had to be the exact day before I left. I'm not sure how long I've been going there but it was before this office was built, I have never abused or misused anything I go to my appointments, pay bills, treat everyone there with respect. Today he not only said he had the authority to over ride doctors & made sure the entire waiting room heard my medical issues & how I had to be there EVERY 28 days.  I agreed to the appointment but left before it was set everyone was staring at me & I didn't want to cry. Again EVERYONE  has been nice & respectful except this new guy so 5 stars to everyone else.

I've recently been under the care of Amanda Lewis, a highly educated and focused PA. She is a straight shooter, and immediately understood my pain issues. She has helped me with several problems, things my PCP has not done. I'm definitely feeling better. She has extensive education and training in some additional  areas that enhance her ability to take care of me and others like me,  and I feel quite fortunate to be seeing her at this time. Thanks, Amanda!
I understand the desire of the practice to discontinue prescribing opiates, given the many problems that the drugs have created in this country, and they are working on finding better ways to care for their patients aside from opiates. More modern and advanced care plans are changing all the time, and this modern practice is meeting challenging new methods in the world of pain treatment.
I wish them continued success in their beautiful new treatment building and surgery center as they continue stepping into the future of up-to-date pain management.|Dr Sills implanted a Spinal Cord Stimulator for me in June 2024. 12 days after the surgery I fell and x-rays showed that my leads moved.
He recommended trying to make adjustments using different programs, however, by the end of September my pain was still uncontrolled and I was having tingling and shooting pain down both arms.
I saw Dr Sills again, and without taking more x-rays, he told me he was confident that my leads didn't move. My battery is also very loose and uncomfortable, and he refused to do a revision claiming that the risk of infection is too high, but then proceeded to offer to remove my Spinal Cord stimulator....which would also put me at risk for infection.

I am changing Dr's and eager to get a second opinion.  I've had some intermittent relief from the SCS, so I'm not ready to give up on it.

Seems to me that a Dr specializing in the treatment of chronic pain would be much more compassionate

His staff is excellent. I'm not sure what happened, but he apparently got tired of treating me.

I wouldn't recommend him!! He seems unstable.|It took me a while to find a doctor who understood my pain and how best to control it.  But now, Sean Sills is abruptly dropping his patients.  Why?  A transitional period?  Due to what?  More expensive procedures and surgeries beyond what insurance allows with zero pain medication.  Making it hard for people to afford pain control unless they're rich and can afford expensive procedures and surgeries?  Also, when I first started going there, I would have an appointment with Dr. Sills every year to discuss my needs.  However, I have not seen him for about five years.  Maybe being dropped as a patient will be for the best!|My rating has to be at least one star. The fact that Dr. Sils considered himself Patient-Centered, his words not mine, is a mockery of what means to have doctors work for us and not the other way around. We spend our hard earned money just the same way they do, one bill at a time, so what makes him think that he can force us to pay for his choice in building a new lab, when his old one was sufficient. I used to be a patient until he allowed his manager of his office, Glenda to call me a liar in the front drive way of the office in front of other patients entering the building all because no one informed us we had had or appointment canceled on us. When we reported that we had actually been exposed to COVID, lo and behold, investigations later and we were telling the truth. You'd think a doctor who was patient centered, again his words not mine would be concerned with his other patients' health? Hmmm. Funny. You'd think, well here's news, Sils and Glenda, we do get telemedicine visits just fine. And yes our insurance does pay the bills, however you are now three more patients less, due to your very unprofessional ethical boundary breaking, and lying to us, multiple occasions, plus my husband's back was so bad due to his damage and yet you never referred him to a a surgeon who was capable and court him off his meds, for no violations!! None! How dare you Shawn Sils! How dare you Glenda!! No, thanks to you he's suffered for years, almost unable to walk!!  How dare you! Not only are you not ethical I'd argue you are negligent! Forcing a patient off the meds for no reason what so ever that you could legally give, because you gave him three different reasons why, why lie Shawn? Huh? At least be accurate Shawn! No more. We spend our money a lot more wisely, and now not for just pain blocking things that were temporary. That's your Patient Centered care in action when you come to Touchstone Pain Interventional Clinic, where you most definitely won't get any integrity what so ever. I've said my piece.|They discontinued prescriptions for pain medication. Patients were left with no options in most cases. Other providers were swamped with patients, leaving many unable to be treated.|Dr Sills
Was the most caring, compassionate and intelligent Doctor who helped me with unimaginable severe pain. He is Great!|First visit 12/18/2023 Dr. Tracy said she was putting in an authorization for the injection immediately coming out of the examination room, as she was walking away from us she held the paperwork up saying I'm sending it off now. We waited, never heard back. On 12/26/2023 I called them, I spoke with Michelle whom told me it was authorized just waiting on the Doctor's schedule to make the injection appointment. Again we waited NO call, I called back 1/10/2023 spoke with Deanna whom told me Michelle gave us incorrect information on 12/26/2023, that it was NOT authorized, and they just sent in the authorization on 1/10/2323. we wait & Again NO call from them, I called 1/17/2023 spoke with Deanna once again, whom said it JUST now went in on 1/16/2023, this is now 2-days shy of 1-month from initial visit, meanwhile my insurance denies the Injection but tells us we can appeal it, that the Touchstone didn't provide enough info, to have Touchstone call their Doctor
( peer to peer ) to see if we can get it approved, we called them on 2/5/2024 gave them insurance info & phone number to call. On 2/19/2024 Jamie of touchstone called to inform us that after relaying the peer to peer call info to Dr. Tracy, that Dr. Tracy's message back to us was she won't make the call to the insurance for us. WOW, here's our thoughts on this facility & how they chose to handle our case.. If they don't want to go the extra mile for their patients, which was clear to see ( they do not), and could careless to have wasted precious PAIN time, thus NOT allowing us the opportunity months ago to seek other facilities whom would care, was clearly a careless and disrespectful move on their part.  Bottom line even if the Insurance decided to approval the injection now, WE NOW REFUSE to go through Touchstone's facility. We spoke with our Insurance today and they agreed with our decision to look for another facility as well....|The office staff at the desk has wonderful qualities of customer service.

Christy quickly built a rapport and trust with me. I really think she cared more about me than anything else going on in the world. Knowing about the medical professions, I observed that it didn't take Christy long of being herself as Christy and Christy, PA for me to trust her counsel on anything.
Christy treated me with great respect, honor, and dignity as a US Military Veteran.

When I asked him why, his answer was ""when I'm in surgery I want to have a clear head.  I don't want to have staff interrupt me every 20 minutes telling me that a patient was complaining that a dog ate their homework.""

He discussed an operation whereby he implants a node at the base of the neck that sends a signal to keep the brain busy and in theory keep the pain at bay by giving the brain something else to focus on other than the pain.  He proceeded to say that that procedure is all he and his colleagues have decided to focus on and that he understood my frustration but that there was nothing more he could do.

When I asked him why he took the consultation and had me fill out intake forms regarding opioids, he ignored the question and kept talking about the surgery.  I probably shouldn't have said this, but I did anyways:  I asked, ""are you doing the surgeries exclusively now just because there's more money in it?""  At which point he gave me a look of death and tried to end the consultation rather quickly.  He took a breath and denied the question, but the hesitation and reaction were clear and vitriolic.

We are a full service pain clinic dedicated to compassionate, individualized care. Successful pain management includes a variety of approaches to treatment. Our goal is to match the safest, most effective treatment to the individual patient.
Our therapies include both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. We offer specialized therapies such as nerve blocks, epidural injections and other diagnostic and therapeutic injections. We are recognized specialists in interventional pain management therapies including spinal cord stimulation and spinal infusion therapy for the control of both pain and spasticity. During a new patient evaluation we will review the spectrum of therapies available for the management of pain.",http://www.oripc.com/,ChIJBfP62vsJlVQROOjXhbGIFYQ,26,4.5,,"+1 503-477-5205",https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPAbCFoHaSKOQD4E0fmlpaEwMEuM3dMW44G23xF=s1024,,"1849 NW Kearney St #201",Portland,Oregon,,97209,45.529395,-122.6899909,,compassionate|insurance|spine,3|2|2,,"https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPAbCFoHaSKOQD4E0fmlpaEwMEuM3dMW44G23xF=s1024, https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipPAbCFoHaSKOQD4E0fmlpaEwMEuM3dMW44G23xF=s1024, https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=gWzSiDi6XW1blW9hv8G64w&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=224&h=298&yaw=8.186438&pitch=0&thumbfov=100",https://painclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AF1QipPAbCFoHaSKOQD4E0fmlpaEwMEuM3dMW44G23xFs1024.jpeg|https://painclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AF1QipPAbCFoHaSKOQD4E0fmlpaEwMEuM3dMW44G23xFs1024-1.jpeg|https://painclinics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/thumbnail-3214.jpeg,1|2|3|4|5,3|0|0|2|21,Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday,"9 a.m.-12 p.m., 1-4 p.m.|9 a.m.-12 p.m., 1-4 p.m.|9 a.m.-12 p.m., 1-4 p.m.|9 a.m.-12 p.m., 1-4 p.m.|Closed|Closed|Closed",,"Turkey|Misti Locklear-Duvall|Randy Watson11|Matthew Neugent (Hewge)|W|Lynda Matson|James Huegli|Dorothea Lander",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115654953291816681114?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104024803484043700775?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117039571968208667682?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111155751245876486827?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102098127985186177178?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107157191842772440305?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100747102570361466790?hl=en-US|https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101749274529221308893?hl=en-US,"Dr. Rosenblum is the most compassionate and caring doctor I have ever had.

Misti|Six months ago I went to see Dr. Stuart Rosenblum MD PHD, after seeing two different orthopedic surgeons and my regular MD they all but one pretty much agreed the problem was in the right hip. Having this  right side pain since 2017 (same time I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma stage 2 with lots of lyric lesions in my spine) Everything indicated it was the hip. I would get a CT scan and take to different doctors, and they  would pretty much agree that it was the hip. Except  one orthopedic surgeon but he just recommend exercise. They all leaned towards the hip or I was imaging it. I went to an appointment with my wife as she a patient of his,  it was the last appointment of the day. I had my MRIs, CTs, and x-rays in hand. I knew Dr Rosenbaum as Connie has been a patient for years. So when Dr R came walking back with my wife I ask him if I could get his opinion on these CTs & X-rays Then man sat down a looked through them all, and stayed over a half hour  after everyone left. Then told me that he didn't think it was the hip at all, but was in my lumber spline. We scheduled an Floral guided injections. After that afternoon my hip felt better the next day my hip felt even better, and after about four or five days,   It been great ever since. The man stayed  past closing time to help me out when I didn't even have an appointment with him we need a lot more people like Dr. Stuart Rosenblum MD.

Any question I have he answers and has a solution to my problems, he has an excellent sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable and not stressed, that is extremely important with a doctor patient relationship to me.

I felt I was in competent hands from the beginning. The coworkers and extended personnel were very conscious about safety issues during covid, and of  my medical/treatment wishes. They also are conscious of what the insurance will or will not pay, and have made me aware ahead of time. All the people there very efficient and kind.

Perhaps share your problem directly before placing it in writing. They may be more responsive than you think. If not, ask for the supervising manager or nurse or call your provider. It is your right to use this system anytime, but think
about how you would feel if someone at your job bypassed you. These can't be removed and can leave lasting harm to a good clinic. If after you speak to them and you are still not pleased, perhaps you can write then and state you tried and got no help.
We could use a little more thought before we act at this grime time. Sorry if I sound preachy.|This place should just be shut down. It's a useless operation no one communicates no one call back. I've been trying to get them to respond for 3 months and nothing! I think the people that work there are inconsiderate unprofessional and uncaring. I'll totally wrong thing for a pain clinic. I don't know what the heck they're doing all day besides sitting around and drinking coffee I guess. Bad management!!|Honestly, I'm quite shocked by all these horrendous reviews. Having been a patient with this clinic for about 4 years, I find them so inaccurate as to question their authenticity. Their appalling accounts are such a dramatic departure from my own experience, I can't help but suspect many of these have been written by people who've never actually been treated here -- perhaps prompted by one or two disgruntled patients.

I've always found the staff to be notably polite and patient, even ensuring I don't forget to have them validate my parking ticket. I've never been made to wait longer than 15 minutes -- typically it's more like 5-10. When I call in to make appointments, they know me by name and work hard to schedule me, even when it seems there are no openings.

My pathology is quite complex with several overlapping diagnoses. As such, I see many specialists/practitioners here, including Amanda St John, Alena Guggenheim, Jordan Graham & Stephen Boyd. Contrary to what other reviews claim, I've experienced nothing but the most attentive, compassionate care -- from each and every one of them.

They take their time with me -- never rush through my appointments -- convey genuine concern and consideration. Not once have I felt they were being dismissive or skeptical of my many and varied structural, psychological and emotional complaints. Quite the opposite; I'm often amazed at their determination to help me understand and manage my pain rather than be utterly crippled by it.

I can't tell you what a relief it's been to feel so SEEN and HEARD after decades of being treated as though I'm exaggerating or over-reacting -- to feel as though I have a dedicated team of people who sincerely care about my well-being -- to know that I no longer have to carry the impossibly heavy burden of my chronic, debilitating pain on my own.

I've got nothing but the deepest gratitude for this clinic and those who work here. Please -- try it out -- I'm quite certain you'll agree.|I had an appt. Feb 9. I had an MRI on jan 31. At my appt they didnt have the MRI and it was a useless visit. I called for a trigger point injection but no longer needed it( shoulder pain that subsided). I made a phone appt. With Dianna Clapper. .she called and still didnt have my MRI results( 3 weeks after I'd had the imaging) she said she couldnt do anything until she saw the MRI.  She said shed call me early the next week. She never called. I've been in debilitating back pain. Fractured vertebra,severe collapsed disc,scoliosis. She sucks. Still haven't received call after my initial visit which was a month ago. Really disappointed in their service.|My appointment with who I thought was an active surgeon left me really disappointed and upset!  I was desperately looking for a surgeon who would give me a third opinion on lower back surgery.  I needed a pretty sophisticated surgery done on my  back and wanted a really good surgeon.  I drove from out of town for the appointment. After going over my MRI and my options I was told ""Oh, I don't perform surgeries anymore.""   He referred me to another surgeon to discuss my options.  So I was not only out the huge amount of money but my time and gas not to mention the pain I went through in the drive there!  Not happy AT ALL.  I suggest that these doctors should have it noted in their title if no longer performing surgery, otherwise is it not false advertising by referring to them and listing them as surgeons along with other active surgeons????  How about Dr. ?, Surgeon Inactive?    Oh my gosh, I just happened to look at the business card I picked up on my way out of this appointment it reads that the person I thought was a Surgeon and who I met with is listed as an ""Instructor"". hmm what happened to my request to meet with a Surgeon for a third opinion when I called?

Terry|Too bad this place tries to force medicine, instead of trying to look inside and see what the underlying problem is..
Kind of funny and doesn't make sense, for example how would a person that needs surgery even know they need surgery? They just say..Try this medicine..
I'm learning in general Healthcare is leaning strongly towards pharmaceutical and they think that should be the answer for everything before they try other things like even just testing even.
Before I had blamed Abigail Dumont and I apologize it is just the policy here, and how health care in general is nowadays. I begged her for a MRI and she couldn't recommend a MRI due to the policies. I wanted to see if I had trigger finger, before going to all these different specialists.
I've had pain in my hand and didn't want a steroid injection until I knew for sure what the underlying problem with my hand was.
Especially since 2 chiropractors said not to get the injections unless I absolutely had to because it can cause long term damage to the bone and joints.
But I've been in so much pain basically I'm feeling forced to get the injections now, since I want relief. And every person I've talked to won't even do a MRI or Ultrasound, won't even look inside. What if it's finger trigger for example how would you know it's nor? They don't know. They just say do this steroid injection, and see if it helps.
And thats how it is for a lot of things. You have to fight for any help. Just pushed medicine.
My cousin had to fight for testing because she felt unwell for a long time and her DR refused to do testing..I told her to fight for it, demand for it. Guess what she did listen to me and did just that, she finally got the testing she needed and they diagnosed her with a liver autoimmune disease..This is what it's like nowadays to find answers.
But I wanted others to be aware this is how it is nowadays, this is your healthcare. You will often be forced medicine, which often only masks the problems, and potentially causes more problems. And you have to fight to get any help trying to find a diagnoses. They will just send you to specialist after specialist and good luck for those specialists helping either as they seem to all just force medicine as well, before they will finally take a look inside.

I'm actually banned from this place, because I was upset and wrote another review how unhappy I was because I was forced to get medicine before a actual diagnoses.
But I do apologize to Abigail as it's not all her fault, for forcing me to get a steroid injection it's the Healthcare system I've realized. If you get help I'm happy for you, if you don't get help like me and are also being forced medicine, or not getting the help you need to get a actual diagnoses I'm sorry I get it. I fully get it.",2025-01-12|2022-02-15|2024-07-25|2024-10-01|2024-12-18|2024-09-27|2024-10-14|2024-12-17,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|2,,,"1 p.m.|2 p.m.|9 a.m.",63|62.4|60.6,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking","How much money have others had to pay for a ""deposit"", and was it returned?

At one point midway through the appointment I asked if I would get a chance to speak and he told me when he was done talking.

We were referred to him by my client's primary care doctor for upper back pain that was occuring about a month or so ago. However, that pain subsided almost immediately upon prescription of propranolol for anxiety by my clients primary care at that same time. We expressed today during prescreening for the pain management that the pain is no longer there, that the medication did the trick, and that it was likely a pulled muscle or something. When Dr Haber came in, it didn't seem as though he researched my client's file at all, and the questions posed to us were often irrelevant given my client's medical condition and where he's at with it. When my client would ask a question, it would either be disregarded entirely, or we were unwillingly given unnecessarily long anatomy lessons. Diagrams, models and speeches are good when there's confusion, but my client already stated several times there's no pain, and what stopped it. Dr Haber went over the MRIs and said there wasn't anything serious in them, just a little arthritis which may or may not cause pain down the road. He suggested PT and stretching... My client does stretch, and has already done PT - it is no longer needed or desired given the state of their medical condition. Dr Haber seemed baffled that the pain went away with the propranolol, as if it's impossible that their severe anxiety exacerbated what may have just been a pulled muscle. Overall it felt like there was a huge lack of understanding and inability to listen from Dr Haber. The only real advice given was to potentially adjust/correct posture. My client felt disregarded and that their time had been wasted. I do not plan on returning to Dr Haber for pain management for my client.|Wonderful care from Dr. Haber. Compassionate and incredibly thorough, I knew I was in good hands from the start. The relief I feel is unbelievable...

I told her I was forced onto it and she said she didn't need to hear that.

She read a image report, but somehow missed where it said advanced narrowing of the disk, and sloghtly less in another, which I pulled the report up and showed the nurse where it even said that, after saying it didn't indicate I was bone on bone which I am, and is why my former pain specialist, an orthopedic surgeon sent me to OHSU for it. The neurosurgeon there confirmed it. She also somewhat dismissed the moderate scoliosis both top and bottom of my spine. My spine is shaped like an S, and it is known to also cause serious pain.

It took me a long time to find a pain mgmt doc that took my insurance. So, when I was referred to Dr. Michael, I didn't have a lot of faith in pain mgmt docs b/c I was afraid she would just throw meds at me & I was so wrong! I was told (or so I thought) my appt was at 2:20 when, in reality, it was at 1:20! I showed up at 2:00 (40 mins late) and, b/c I drove 2 hrs for my first appt, they worked me in! Then, during my appt, she didn't immediately jump into prescriptions... she actually took the time to talk & listen to me. I've had pain for as long as I could remember & she actually came up with some great ideas on how to manage it with PT, injections, possible spinal cord stimulator, etc. The last thing we discussed was meds.

I had two appointments with doctor Pierce and it was one failure after the next starting with the front desk. During my first appointment they downplayed my symptoms I described & asked why I was even there for an appointment. He told me he would be ordering MRIs for my lumbar spine & pelvis & to wait for Oregon Imaging to call me. 3 weeks passed & I received no call from Oregon Imaging to schedule my MRI's. I followed up with Dr. Pierce's office and they informed me that the medical assistant forgot to order my MRIs and that they would do that immediately & apologized for their error. Upon going to my follow up appointment I addressed my concerns with having to wait 3 weeks for my MRI's to be scheduled because of the negligence of his medical team. Dr. Pierce's response to this was ""well would the three weeks made you any difference"" and proceeded to laugh. I personally have never experienced such unprofessional behavior from a medical professional. The findings of my MRI has resulted in me needing surgery due to a false joint that has formed due to injures from my car accident.|I have had multiple  RFA treatments in multiple places on my spine.

It took me years to get care from a pain specialist but I have accept this immature & rude Dr, instead of having choices like other insurances?

Both the nurse and the NP were thoroughly irritated that they had to interact with patients.  The amount of deep breathing, sighing, telling us ""I don't have time to do this"", etc. was as close to an adult tantrum as I've seen.

Nonetheless, to post you must select at least one star.
My neurostimulatar, the generator that severely reduced the nerve pain I had been experiencing, died and after waiting approximately 1.5 years to get it replaced that date arrived.
Finally, June 21, 2025 arrives and we travel 2 hours to Wilsonville for the surgery and awakening from the anesthesia to learn they replaced the power unit. However,  they couldn't connect it as the ""wiring and leads were burnt up."" Clearly this never entered their thoughts that this could be an option and left the new unit in my back disconnected.
Does Columbia Pain Management follow or display any concern for their patient, ""HELL NO!"" The refer me to another surgeon an it takes an additional seven-plus weeks to see this new surgeon on September 12, 2024.
I have yet another waiting period for an authorization to fix the problem that Columbia Pain Management neglected to correct the first time.
Because they lack professionalism and appreciate knowledge to effectively replace what's already there, it has severely impacted the quality of my life, marriage, career, and the ability to get any form of quality sleep for more than 1.5 hours.
It taken me awhile to write this and my anger and desire to verbally lash out would have changed the entire tone of this message.

I leave you with an old motto ""Used car buyer beware!""

John Bellman|Honestly, if I can get no stars, I would I came to this establishment about five months ago, my doctors re-recommended me here for a nerve test because I got an injection in my lower back and I got this seriously hard burn that was going from my eyeball and neck to my index finger thumb middle finger on my left hand honestly, it was weird because they said it was a coincidence but they played it off like I was lying. I guess the doctor basically said yeah man I dropped a bomb on your back. What do you expect, I went to another doctor surgeon at rebound and Vancouver and said I have a pinched nerve there and he needs a surgically fix it but when I was at coulbia Paine management , I felt as if they were treating me as if I needed more drugs that's why I was there making stuff up and I'm trying to blame them for something that went wrong after injection  and that's not the case.!! I was just explaining to them that I feel like I was flipped upside down all of a sudden all the pain in my leg is gone and it was gone for the 1st 3 days after injection after that it's all back to day one pain so now I have a lower back and neck problem and now all the pain is in my upper left chest behind the shoulder blade shooting down to my hand makes me very nauseous.when both of my neck and leg start shooting pain  Makes me wanna vomit. I can't even look up to make eye contact with people without shooting or being """"barbecued  it's just it's been very painful. It's affected me!! affected my work!!! it affected my marriage!!! affected my relationships even with my pets!!! Something just gotta give. I'm gonna get the nerve test done here, but hopefully it's a lot smoother and they've I don't know.grown up and  Hopefully just act more professional I mean they are doctors and I'm supposed to trust you with my life literally! They need to do a better job to listen to their  patience, not pick and choose who you want to help today don't treat everyone like drug addicts because honestly, I had a really really big problem and you guys told me that I was lying. I even got turned around from the ER in Hood River because it's something that you have to order for an MRI. You just can't come in for an MRI and YOU GUYS WOULDNT OREDER ME ONE WHEN I CAME UP FOR A  Referral they told me I will be fine , then at the ER I was turned down as well because like I said, I didn't have a referral from the doctor. I just went and saw because they didn't think I was worth their time. I don't know  I was still panicked and scared and stressed out and and above all, I feel like my pain migrated to my top of my left eyeball down my neck to my left arm down to my hand, so I was very scared and I wanted this to be looked at like something's wrong. You know there'd be no difference if you just lit my arm on fire with a gasoline and threw a lit match at me .
Until A neurosurgeon doctor told me a little trick that helps and scheduled a surgery to un pinch my nerve and the help for my primary care physician which he's been taking this more serious than any other doctors that I've talked to about this,
THANK GOD other than that guys I'm just really scared about coming back to this place and it's just darn it. If there was other places I could go to different doctors I could talk to in this profession I would!!  but I feel a little landlocked to you guys ,  I just really hope, it's a different experience the second time around and then the payment I paid you guys when I was there you guys called me back. Say I owe you more money so I paid it and then a couple months ago but I get another bill out of the blue I haven't been there and then I talk to a guy named Chris and billing and he tells me oh yeah you just got to keep pay so this is weird too. If you guys you know do business like that where I just have to keep paying and micromanage these payments with you guys and when you said I'm already paid up that is also ridiculous I do not trust this establishment and that really sucks. well it sucks for alot of us here in the mountains in the Pacific Northwest..|I've had multiple procedures with Columbia Pain Management, and each time I have come away glad I came to this place for help!

I've had several back injections performed and two ablations. The last one however did not work. It actually made me hurt worse than ever. The pain meds they prescribed were only for a month. I called for an appointment to refill my prescription and they refused to book it stating I still had a balance because insurance hadn't paid yet. I paid my $1000 deductible yet they weren't going to schedule because insurance was pending?! I called my insurance company. Pain management billed incorrectly so they sent it back and it had already been paid on Sept 27th, almost a month ago! Still no appointment or call back or answers to repeated emails. My husband has the same issue. His dr referred him three times but they claim he has an outstanding bill from years ago. They claim they'd talked to someone he'd never even heard of! It truly is all about the mighty dollar for them.|At first, I was referred to another clinic in Hood River I was told to go home and take Tylenol and do sit ups!!!!!

She was knowledgeable, efficient, patient and empathetic. I liked her immediately. Then I met Dr. Berndt. Within the first three minutes I could tell that my fears and apprehension we're totally unfounded with this guy. He came in prepared with my X-rays and past medical history and was familiar with my condition that makes me have pain. He educated me on procedures that can potentially reduce my pain level a great deal. These were treatments I didn't even know existed. He was empathetic to my financial status and continued the medication that was way less expensive than some of the newer ones, and confirmed my Ortho doc's recommendation of surgery to fix some of the issues. He was a very good, kind, empathetic and more than competent doctor.

Finding the location was a bit difficult without clearly designated signs. A vinyl banner at the main intersection 2 blocks away  identifying Peace Health as a business practice operating in that location would have made finding the practice easier .  The choice to inform  the patient of the GUIDELINES SET IN PLACE was after the fact of sitting down with the clinician to review the practice and accept the fact that this facility only offers a limited scope of treatment and does not prescribe certain medications or at least specify the purpose of providing the service available was really vague . These notifications should be made plain and clear from the onset of the referral . This  practice of making these choices clear is rather deceptive along with what might be termed a TAPER DOWN PROGRAM for certain medications should be posted and made available before the patient is half way through the examination is deceptive and eluding to the nature and cause of the referral itself . Those 2 key points might be better reviewed by the joint commission along with the federal trade commission that oversees the insurance regulations. I'm certain that I'm not the only one to encounter this inconvenience and costly measure . I plan on disputing the charges accrued today based on the facts outlined above and encourage any of the readers to do the same by reporting these complaints directly to the Washington State insurance Ombudsman. The guidance provided as an option is not inline with policy procedures advised by the CDC, DEA, or Washington State Department of Health and Human services . Sorry to say that the choices for using BUPINORPHINE or any of its variant formulas Containing ,  Suboxone , SUBUTEX, or naloxone is now a part of a greater CLASS ACTION SUIT being litigated in courts across the nation .

After an initial consultation and filling 10 pages of redundant and repetitive questions which were mostly unnecessary. I was given another appointment for an injection in my back. He told me that this will either make the pain go completely away, or nothing at all or something in between! Well, the next day my pain got worse than before and is hurting me a lot.
This was he worst experience in my 79 years of life. He has an extremely unpleasant and rude demeanor. He did not appear to have access to my medical records and I was not given any summary of the procedure after my visit. This event does not appear on my medical charts and I have no documents to show me a record of his injection and the medication.
I would highly recommend to stay away from this practice and seek help somewhere else.|Found him to be an astounding listener. He puts great value in what you tell him and seems almost anxious to hear more from you. He is most sympathetic about any misgivings you might have  as to the course of treatment he suggests. You can tell that your relief from pain is of highest priority to him.He is impressed when His patients are extremely smart and can carry on an intelligent conversation with him. His staff is incredibly nice to patients and puts extra effort in help making sure you schedule all the appointments and treatments required. I kind of felt that they would even come get you if transportation was a problem for you. The benefits derived from the level of genuine care received there made it so I didn't have to keep a second appointment. I sleep better at night from their clinic's care. What a place.|August 2022 Update - after almost a year as Dr. Jayaram's patient I am changing my review.

The one treatment that worked fabulous was the injections he gave in my SI joint. That was a miracle of pain relief. His assistant Ronnie is a saint. That's where the good review ends.

His primary treatment for me was morphine three times a day. I thought about if I wanted to become dependent on morphine for a long time. It seemed kind of extreme and scary. Finally, I believe it was last October 2021, I decided it was worth trying. It did help some of course, arthritis pain in the winter was still an issue though. He wouldn't talk to me about my situation and experience. He only wanted me to take the morphine, period.

I truly thought I was taking it regularly and not missing hardly any. However, clearly that wasn't the case as I wasn't able to pick up my prescription in a timely fashion this July and found I had accumulated an extra week supply over the last several months. Maybe I was feeling better and just forgetting? Maybe I could take less and have another prescription on hand for flare ups which happened all along anyway?

He marched in the exam room read me the riot act and was extremely mad at me. Seemed to think even after 11 months of knowing me that I was only seeking opiates from him and told me I could find another doctor if that's what I wanted. He insisted that the treatment I've been using for the last 15-20 years wasn't effective based on studies. Didn't matter that my experience was different. I wonder if my vocabulary didn't accurately fit his pain vocabulary? Anyway, he stormed out of the room leaving me feeling shell shocked. The nurse assured me I could call in for refills and it would be ok. That he was worried about getting in trouble and losing his license. After processing this for about an hour,  I decided if I wasn't taking the morphine correctly anyway, I wanted to get off it. Called in asked how best to stop taking the morphine. The nurse said she couldn't tell me that the doctor had to do that. I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM YET, THAT WAS AUGUST 3. I tapered down beginning that day for a week then stopped. Started feeling weird and sick then looked into officially how to stop and found the process is called going through detox and should be done under doctor care. It takes 4-10 days. Decided to continue on my own and am fine now but it was a miserable week or so. SHAME ON YOU DR. JAYARAM|I saw this doctor about 17 years ago for some lower neck pain that was bothering me for a long time.  He have me the pain injections twice and the pain that I had been suffering for years never came back.  I now have other pain that I would like to see if he can help with.  He was an awesome doctor.  I now live in Texas and will come up to Oregon to see him cause in Texas I can not find anyone as good as him.|Don't believe the negative reviews!

I feel like I am finally on the road to a better quality of life, for the first time in years.|He is hands down the most thorough doctor I have ever been to. He treats you like a patient and truly cares about patient care more then any other dr I have been to. It's all about corporate medicine these days and Dr George is not that way. He takes the time with each one of his patient to give real care which I'm truly greatful I found him.|Probably one of the most detailed and in depth visits I have been to in 40 years.

Dr. George explained all of my medications and how to properly take them, best time of day, etc.. medications that I've been on for years! He also listens to every medical question you have, without having to make appointments for each condition. He spent a few hours with me on my first visit, I felt like he really listened to me. I'm grateful to have found a provider that is so thorough with everything he does. He is even taking care of my non-pain conditions so I can find a Primary Care provider that my insurance does accept. I know that not accepting insurance may be a deciding factor but if you do choose to see him, it is totally worth it.|Dr. George is not a fifteen minute doctor. There is no time limit set and no rushing from patient to patient. You have his full attention. He really listens to what you have to say. Before it is your turn to see him there are always a couple pages of forms to fill out about how you have been doing since the last time you saw him, which is usually monthly. He also makes you take responsibility when it comes to your health, like eating right and exercising. Dr. George has been my physician for many years and I'm very satisfied with the care I get. Plus his office staff are the nicest I have ever encountered. And I am not being compensated for this review.|I have been a patient of Dr George for 3 to 4 years now. I drive 1.1/2 hour to his office and back for my checkups. Before Dr George I had a terrible doctor.. Dr George is thorough, professional, respectable, and he really cares about his patients.

Dr. Jorgensen has been very informative and has always presented me with all the opportunities and let me choose my path.  This clinic is my third clinic in 15 years and it is significantly better than the others I've been to, both the doctor and the staff.  I'm not having injections at this point, but if I needed them in the future, I would have high confidence in Dr. Jorgensen's ability to treat me.|Dr. Jorgensen is one  of the few doctors I have encountered these days that truly seems to care about his patients. He takes the time to get to know your situation and you as a person. I'm so pleased that he's my doctor. I'm waiting to see if the injection works but regardless, I'm optimistic he'll be able to get my pain under control. I highly recommend him & his staff.|Dr. Jorgensen comes across as one of those doctors who are just in the business of collecting insurance money.  At my first appointment with him he came across as arrogant, unconcerned with me, in a hurry, and we talked for only about 5 minutes.  In the last 6 months since then I have only talked to him that one time--his assistant is the only contact I have ever had. Even when he does a procedure on my cervical spine, he doesn't talk to me before or after the procedure. Within minutes (after a procedure) I am sent out the door while still sedated.  At the last procedure he injected too much of the sedative and he still sent me out the door within minutes after the procedure. I was bumping into walls and falling onto cars as I made my way to my car. Thank God I brought a driver!  Once he prescribed a muscle relaxer that caused me to hallucinate.  I went online to read about the medication only to discover that it is not suppose to be taken with one of the other medications I am on. You trust a doctor to check into these things--isn't that the point of giving him a list of all of my medications at my intake appointment?  The procedures he has done for me have only increased my pain significantly.   You'd think that due to my pain being so much worse he'd want to talk to me, but no, I have still only talked to him once.  Lastly, I made a 2:00 appointment for today.  I received 2 or 3 reminder phone calls which said that I had an appointment at 2:00.  When I got there the receptionist said that I missed my 1:45 appointment and so it was canceled.   Even if my appointment was at 1:45, which is was not, the appointments at the Oregon Pain Center only last about 5 or 10 minutes, so why on earth couldn't they see me? I demanded my usual 5 minute appointment with the assistant so that I could get a referral for an MRI and get a referral for another doctor. I will never ever go back to the Oregon Pain Center.|I am 44 years old, I am an anesthesia provider, and a patient with degenerative disc disease.  I have had 2 spine surgeries and one ablation prior to meeting the team at Oregon Pain Center.  Caitlin, the RN scheduled all my appointments like a pro. Albert, the Physician Assistant, listened to every word I said, and treated me respectfully, as a patient with legitimate pain.  Dr. Mambalam did my injections and RFA beautifully and I got 90% relief (so far!) Even working in healthcare, I felt sometimes as though I was not believed.  I felt belittled, and as though I should just stop asking for help.  OPC made me feel welcome. They understood, and they treated me respectfully.  For that I will always be grateful. Don't give up.  Call OPC.|Dr. Jorgensen gets 5 stars for being very thorough and respectful to his patients. His assistant Sara gets 5 stars too, but the other staff gets 1 star. The communication between the lead MA, Receptionist, and other staff is not working well. I've had 3 different staff members tell me different things with no consideration to my schedule or how they are affecting my life and work. Every appointment is over 2 hours of time. That's 2 hours of overtime working and being away from my family. I'm sure that I am speaking for the majority of the patients there, we REALLY don't want to have to go! If I had a choice, I wouldn't be there. I've dropped everything I'm doing to get there and I've had instances where the traffic was bad and I called to see if I should reschedule and was told to continue there  (driving for an hour), only to get there and be told to reschedule. Or even better, drive for over an hour only to be told that it was changed or cancelled and no one told me.|OPC took me in when other clinics claimed I was an addict, and worked with me to get pain free in 7 weeks. Their staff is more than courteous; they're like a family. I love Dr. Mambalam and Albert's rapport, in working with me they did what other clinics couldn't.. give me hope for a pain-free life without lots of medications. The injections I had were the least painful I've ever gotten and I am glad to be on a minimal medication regimen. Thank you so much Oregon Pain Center!|Staff and PA are just fine, but the rot starts at the top I assume. Been in past few months seeking spinal injections. Used their portal to message and ask about payment, my share, etc. Never got a response. Had to reschedule my appointment, and the day BEFORE my new appt date, was called and told insurance wouldn't cover the injections, so I pay full price or do a different approved procedure (because insurance knows best apparently). Also their billing dept doesn't review this stuff until day of, hence the late notice. Their departments seem compartmentalized and disappointed. Icing on the cake is they probably don't pay/treat their employees well enough to retain them since they had several people quit and have been short staffed. This has management's dirty hands all over it, but if you can put up with not getting a hold of anyone in a short staffed office, I'm sure the medicine itself is at least up to standard|Now I know why Trevor Jorgensen has so many single star ratings. While I was in severe pain, I felt rushed. He glanced at his watch often. I shared how much pain I was in, but it didn't occur to him to address my suffering. I later told my PCP and he was shocked I wasn't given pain medication.

Jorgensen saw my MRI and confidently told me I needed surgery, possibly totally disc replacement. ""It's pretty bad,"" he said. My heart sank. A month later, I started feeling better on my own. My surgeon told me I'd be fine with just physical therapy.

Not impressed, and perhaps even a little angry, with Jorgensen's incompetence and inability to engage with patients in pain. I'd think a place named the Pain Center would have expertise in addressing people's suffering.  Not so.

My sincere suggestion - go somewhere else.

Edit: look at your response, Jorgensen. Your words speak for themselves.  Now I am relieved I spoke frankly. May potential patients be aware.

Edit 2: it appears Jorgensen deleted his nasty reply.",2020-03-13|2016-04-04|2018-07-14|2021-12-30|2016-11-12|2020-12-22|2022-08-05|2019-10-10,5|5|1|5|2|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Appointment required",,,long_wait_times|cash_credit_payments_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJrfHQ0TMJlVQRhhsCLdDxz9M,68

We tried every pain cream on the market but didn't really get to pain.  We did a lot of research into treatments that were pill free.  Scrambler Therapy was brought to our attention and it's reviews were encouraging.  We have been part of the program for a few weeks and his pain has decreased significantly!  With this decrease in pain he has been less depressed and sleeping thru the night.  No adverse side effects  and med-free us the best part.  Highly recommend Scrambler Therapy!!|Scrambler therapy at Radiant has been the miracle I needed.   Surgery and all types of injections did not provide relief and it felt as if my life was over. I spent my days and nights in a recliner with a heating pad. My physiatrist (an MD who specializes in physical medicine and rehab) provided a referral to Radiant and through their help, I got my life back! The care managers are well-trained technicians and problem solvers. They're also exceptionally kind and understanding.|I have had a wonderful experience with both Radiant and the staff. I have fibromyalgia and small fiber neuropathy that cause a lot of pain. The therapy through Radiant has taken that pain away and given me my life back. I am now able to get out of my house and do activities for the first time in over a year- with little to no pain. The staff at Radiant have been extremely kind, compassionate and nurturing. I would not have gotten through this process without their help and kindness. Thank you Radiant!|Radiant Pain Center has been a life saver for me. I have degenerative spine disease and really bad nerve pain in my hips, legs and feet.  Prior to going to Radiant Pain Center I was using a walker and sometimes a wheelchair due to the terrible pain. I was on round the clock oxycodone to control the pain but it still was there. I could not get out of bed in the morning until my pain meds kicked in. My husband had purchased me an electric wheelchair for when it was really bad. I started going and at first it worked for an hour or two then the next time a little longer and a little longer. Now I just go in for what I call a ""touch up"" when the pain starts to leak through again. I am on very little pain meds now, just when I really over do it. I own a business and can work full time again. I swear by this system hope it works for you!|I have a neuro disease CRPS -- this place made it worse. The person doing the treatment is not even a medical professional and she had no idea what she was doing. After almost a week she still spiked my pain instead of getting it to 0 on machine.

We demanded a refund and instead flew to Calmar Pain Relief Dr. D'Amato in Florida. He is the expert on scrambler therapy. He got me to a 0 every single day on the machine. And it helped me a lot.

He said the outcome depends on the expertise of the practitioner and clearly that Radiant Pain had no clue what they were doing. In fact, the woman doing it in Tualatin tried to put the leads directly on my pain area, which Dr D'Amato said was horrifying aa that is the opposite of how you use scrambler technology.

Avoid this place like the plague. Do not waste your time and money. Go to a dr who performs it like Dr D'Amato, or Dr Boese in Eagle, ID. Because this Tualatin place is a joke and will make you worse.|Scrambler therapy has changed my entire life. I thought it was woo when I heard about it, but the data supports it and it's FDA-approved. The therapy works with your own neuroplasticity and growth mindset to forge new neural pathways, so it's basically an entire mind-body rewiring that teaches your brain (with your enthusiastic support!) that your body doesn't need to feel pain where it's no longer injured.

I went in ready for change, and I am so grateful I did.|I was a little skeptical about this procedure when I first heard about it but a very reliable person told me it work wonders for their pain.  My trigeminal neuralgia was killing me so I tried a treatment at Radiant Pain Relief Center.  The results were amazing the throbbing pain was gone after one treatment.  The pain has returned a few times but follow up treatments are keeping it under control.  I recommend you try this.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) also  called reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), while there is no cure, there is treatment that helps here. Its this scrambler therapy for this nerve disorder.  Thank you to this clinic and their staff for helping me and believing my pain. I felt a difference in my first 2 sessions.  And I have done over 20 now.

Update 1/12/2025
I just wanted to update my care with Pain and Spine. I am still receiving care from them and it is still execellent. I am now getting ready to have a temporary wires to be inserted in my back one on each side of my spine for a pain stimulator device to be attached on February 3, 2025, to see if the device will stop my pain. If so then a permanet device will be implanted and attached to the wires. But, let me tell you prior to this decision there was injections and testing done to find out what was causing my systems.  And also to see if I were a canidate for this device.
My opinion is still the same these people care about their patients. If you are in severe pain like me then you need to see them and msybe they can help you to.|I've been coming here for several years. I've seen several PAs as well as Dr Hites.

He listened to my concerns, has come up with a treatment plan to help me and also got me to the specialists that he felt needed to review my case and I finally got answers this year and am set to get surgery this upcoming Thursday to replace 2 discs in my neck that are pressing on my spinal cord. I am and will forever be grateful for him and his legit care for his patients. If you are needing someone that wants to take the time to listen to your concerns, come up with a treatment plan for you and really cares about his patients- Tim is your guy!|I have a great Dr and Nurses they are all very nice and answered all my questions.! They were very gentle when the Doctor was refilling my pump and he raised the medicine so I would be more comfortable. They helped me get up and down on the table, because I have a broken shoulder and it's still swollen and hurting so very much because it's still out of the socket. they both were very gentle with me!! I love them all they are all nice and understanding !! I would tell anyone if they need a pain Doctor !!|If you are looking for a good Dr.. look no further! The Dr's/Staff here are all amazing, they actually listen to your concerns,  they explain everything  in detail!!  Not pushing medication, which is huge! Dr. Gandhi makes sure at all times you are comfortable  for what  ever treatment you are receiving!!
Thank You all , you are a Blessing to me and my Family!!|Excellent Doc. & Staff. My Dr. is Dr. Gandhi & he is wonderful! He listens and explains things very well. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Gandhi is respectful to the staff he works with and the office has a positive family feel. He teaches staff that are interested in understanding what and why he is doing what he does. I find this refreshing and refreshing that the staff are interested in learning from him.  Pain can be anxiety producing, as can procedures to help pain relief. The staff, the technicians that assist Dr. Gandhi & Dr. Gandhi put me at easy and are enjoyable to talk to under a sometimes difficult condition of seeking pain management. Kudos to all the folks atThe Greensburg Main St. Office!|I had an excellent visit. I feel terrible for not remembering the doctor's name, but he did my ablations and took care of my pain pump. He is professional with an excellent bedside manner. The staff is on the ball and very knowledgeable. They are all respectful and nice as well.|If I could give zero stars, I would. I didn't necessarily have any issues with the staff at the office, but their billing department made an error on TWO visits to their office so it was not covered by my insurance. This amounted in close to $2,000. This occurred back in September 2023 and I have been trying to get it fixed since then. They won't answer in the billing department or call me back. I've reached out to the doctor's office numerous times as well and all they say they can do is email billing. NO ONE has called me back, but I keep getting bills. I have NEVER had issues like this with a doctor's office. I would suggest going somewhere else.|All the staff is very professional and informative! They take great care of me and my medical situation.  Dr Ghandi is an excellent physician! I appreciate all the staff in this office!

He told me that I would return to normal in two weeks.
The surgery was performed on May 21, 1997.
Two weeks later I developed a Hospital Infection that turned into Sepsis,
Since that time I have had 16 major Surgeries in the past 27 years.
Nine fusions, multiple Laminectomies and decompressions, both shoulders replaced and many more life changing surgeries.
I was in pain 24/7. I was in so much pain and so depressed, I was ' not a happy camper.'
Then luckily, I found Pennsylvania Pain And Spine.
From the moment I walked into Pain Clinic, everyone I spoke to, made me feel like they really cared about me!
The Doctors staff was both highly professional and compassionate about the level of pain I was feeling. Everyone in the office greeted me with caring smiles and began my treatment that immediately made me feel better.
If you are suffering like I was, I highly recommend you that you set up an appointment at Pennsylvania Pain And Spine.|I called to make an appointment and the voicemail stated we only take patients with insurance. I then got someone on the phone and told them I will pay upfront. They scheduled me for 2 weeks later. I get a call one day prior to my appointment saying they are canceling since I didn't have insurance. This is not only rude, but a violation of my rights and their oath! I will not fight this as I will be treated poorly even if I won.|I am in the middle of my back surgery care after surgery two years ago that did not go well. My surgeon discharged me with a good luck and I still had trouble. I found Pa Pain and Spine, read the reviews and am seeing the team and Dr Bozak presently. Currently being treated.
He said that he would not give up on me as others have. And I believe him. Friendly competent folks at both locations. I would recommend highly.|I was a patient at PP&SI From October, 2023 until April, 2024. I went there seeking some relief from intense sciatica and weakness in the hamstrings. Rounds of PT and chiropractic had provided no relief. After doing some research, I found that Dr Qu and the Institute seemed to have a fine reputation. And, there was obviously a lot of positive feedback from satisfied patients. I also viewed on-line videos and agreed with their conservative approach.

At my first visit in October of last year, the consensus was that I had spinal stenosis. I was given an epidural shot in November that did not have an effect. Then I had an MRI done in January and turned the disc over to the PA and Dr Bozak. It clearly indicated on the written MRI report that I had ""anterolisthesis of L4 relative to L5.""  My question is with this indication of spondolisthesis in early January, why wasn't a spinal fusion recommended right then? And, why did I go on to have nerve block facet injections (February) and then the MILD procedure (April) in which a laminotomy was performed? This also provided no relief.

I've since come to find out that this condition is almost always dealt with through a spinal fusion. Long story, short, I finally moved on to a top notch neurosurgeon who advised me at my first visit that I would need a spinal fusion. (Which I have had)
But, by the time I found the surgeon, saw him and then, unfortunately,  was denied coverage initially because I had to do another round of PT, finally having the surgery in early October --- I experienced an additional six months of pain and continually worsening symptoms.

I only wish that PP&SI had advised me back in January that they could no longer help me and recommend that I see a neurosurgeon. When I first went to the Institute, I didn't even own a cane, but by the time I left there as a patient, I couldn't do without one. I mailed a letter about my case to both Dr Qu and Dr Bozak in October, but got no reply. After a month, I re-sent the letters via certified mail. Still no reply, nobody reaching out.

I don't think that I was wrong to be disappointed with how my case was handled. Now, I'm additionally disappointed that I'm being ignored. This has been a sincere and respectful request for clarification on my part. Nothing but crickets...|I transferred from another very well-known pain management place in the Bucks county area, and I never looked back.

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.|My Physician Assistant, Jennifer Della Guardia is a phenomenal Physician Assistant and has worked with me for years through all my debilitating pain arthritis and recently in the last 3 years a horrible accident. She has been an amazing medical professional. When she did my trigger points she was very gracious she tried to do as much as she could for me as far as locating pain and giving me as many injections that she could to provide the best relief. She was always a good listener and give you as much time as you needed. I don't see her as much presently for insurance reasons, however I recommend her tremendously to anyone who wants someone with medical expertise and has the awareness in understanding the emotional impact of pain has on its sufferers. That is so important since it's not just treating pain medically, it's establishing a emotional rapport with the patient by displaying her compassion and comprehending the emotional suffering that occurs when someone suffers from chronic pain!

In my opinion, and I'm sure I'm not alone in the way I feel, Jennifer Della Guardia demonstrates this daily with all her patients daily, regardless of who she is helping!!!

And the staff are all such nice and understanding professionals! I'm so happy I found this place|Dr. Ali and staff made me feel like I really mattered. They took my concerns to heart and made me feel listened to and cared for. Dr. Ali was determined to provide me with much-needed pain relief. And he was as serious about finding the root of the cause as I was. I would undoubtedly put my pain management health in Dr. Ali's hands in the future. I would recommend PICPA to anyone dealing with undiagnosed/untreated pain. Dr. Ali was respectful of my referring physician and their recommendations.|I have always had a great experience with the Dr. he takes his time and explains everything in detail. He has helped me get my life back. I have a bad back but he has worked with me throughout it all. I would highly recommend him to anybody. His staff is wonderful and very friendly. Thank you Dr Ali for staying with me. A++++++++++++++ Dana Clark Roles|Dr. Ali is an amazing doctor. He listens to you and talks about your issues. He doesn't just get you in and out super fast like other places do. I drive to the Carlisle office to have my injections done. I do my follow up appointments in the Chambersburg office. Its pretty cool he has 2 locations for the people that want to see him and they don't want to drive far. The only way you would need to drive far is if you would need a procedure done as he doesn't do them in the Chambersburg office. They always seem to get me in pretty fast for an appointment. I have been seeing Dr. Ali for about a year now. I recommend him to anybody that wants a good honest doctor that will listen to you and he will truly do his best to get your pain down as much as possible.",2024-11-25|2024-01-23|2017-11-29|2023-05-13|2018-11-12|2022-09-29|2022-04-13|2018-12-02,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|1 p.m.",40|36.2|35.2,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJwy2AZW-eyYkRglCiYkJCukc,43

I know multiple people who have gone to BOTH practices and have experienced a nightmare.  They are currently cutting existing patients prescriptions down so they can prescribe to new patients.

They have cut their entire clinic down twice in 2 months time lying and telling them the DEA made them.

On the topic of insurance, they are also charging their chippewa office patients $40 co-pays which my insurance confirmed is ILLEGAL because it's a copay for a doctor and never ONCE was I seen by a DOCTOR.
