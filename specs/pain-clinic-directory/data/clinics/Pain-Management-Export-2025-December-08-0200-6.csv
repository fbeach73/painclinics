The injection was the worst pain I've ever experienced.   I had a shooting lightening bolt of pain from my butt to my ankle when he put the spinal needle in.  Prior to having this injection my pain was only to my knee, now the pain is to my ankle.  I left in a wheelchair as I was unable to walk.  2 1/2 months later this experience is still traumatic to me.|Dr Shah is one of the most compassionate Dr's. I've ever had. He listens,understands what I'm telling him. He has taken the time after my procedures to explain what was done and asks me if I have quest. I never feel hurried! The nurses are exceptional!|PLEASE READ TO THE END AS MY OPINION HAS CHANGED DUE TO LAST TWO APPOINTMENTS!  The staff is very friendly, caring, compassionate, empathetic yet are still very professional. I have always felt I was treated with respect and have always felt listened to. My issues have always been addressed and options for increasing comfort and decreasing pain are always thoroughly explained.  I have only had good experiences regardless of wether my appointment has been in person visits or telehealth.  They are very thorough at every visit with questions and going over patient health summaries to make sure any changes are up to date. The above is my review from several months ago I had given 5 . My last TWO CONSECUTIVE appointments have changed my review to the current 2.  Telehealth had to wait on my Telehealth appointment for OVER 2 hours for Dr. Shah to show up for the 5 minute conversation!  Next appointment I had to call to check myself in @ 9:45 for my ""scheduled "" 10:00 Telehealth appointment because no one called me to check me in!  I was then told it would be an hour before he would be available as he had procedures to do ahead of my appointment. I guess my appointment was less important.  Perhaps my Telehealth appointment should have been scheduled at 11:00 NOT 10:00. 1 appointment may be a mistake but 2 in a row shame on you!  People who are in chronic pain deserve to be treated with RESPECT, COMPASSION, EMPATHY AND KINDNESS! They should NEVER be treated as a ""second thought"" or ""inconvenience"" to other treatments. Peoples time is valuable just because we are not medical professionals does not make our time inconsequential.  We should not be made to feel that way.  This facility need an overhaul and changes need to be made.  I am a positive, understanding laid back person however I am now feeling frustrated and disrespected. Please get your s$&t together and treat your patients better. We deserve and expect it!|The whole experience was great.  Staff excellent.  Even though Dr. Shah is a White Sox fan (go Cubs) I found him to be amicable and knowledgable.   He's my pain doctor.|3 xs I heard him repeat using the same medication I was found to have an allergy to and another medication that causes me urinary problems.

He's blunt and to the point, but most importantly - he KNOWS what he is doing. He shows he cares by TREATING you, which is worth far more to me than any words.

I injured my back in my mid 20s, in the Army, and suffered crippling sciatic pain well into my 30s. MRI and Nerve conduction studies confirmed an issue, but SEVEN specialists were unable to find the underlying cause. Most offices wanted to prescribe medication, not treat the underlying issue.

I drove up from Casper to meet with Dr. Mansell and we discussed in person. He suggested a treatment approach that I had not considered and convinced me to give it a try - I was skeptical, but willing to try anything out of desperation. Prior to treatment, I couldn't lay on my back, wear a belt, lift anything heavy, or wear anything but the loosest sweatpants. This was my life for nearly SEVEN years.

In the months since I first worked with Dr. Mansell, I have  nearly returned to my prior fitness level. Even more than that, I can SLEEP through the night again.

Give him a chance to work with you. I was limping through life, wondering how I could possibly be a good dad to my children when I couldn't even get a good night's rest.

Working with Dr. Mansell changed my life. If you're ready to give up after bouncing from office to office, GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

I can't articulate just how grateful I am. My quality of life went from 2/10 back to 10/10.|The care my husband received from Dr Mansell was exceptional. He listened attentively to our concerns and provided personalized treatment that yielded positive results. The entire team at the clinic displayed a high level of friendliness and professionalism and made us feel comfortable throughout. We would definitely recommend Dr Mansell.

The problem is they must not communicate within. To get an MRI after therapy he would have to reorder it. Thurman came in and first thing he said was to be ""blunt"". Will he didn't want to see me which was confusing. His attitude was incorrect. He also said will you have to much going on with you. I was like that's why I am here. I told him was he a back and spine specialist? He walked out and left me there. My feelings are he wanted to go home as it was almost 4:00 pm and upset because he wasn't possible informed by his staff that set up the therapy and my appointment. I would never recommend this place at all. Very miss communication within, hearing him outside the door, his body language and saying will to be blunt. Unwilling to actually listen and walking out.
I run a company and will share my experience to others. Very unprofessional.|Very knowledgeable, came to the appointment with specific info based on MRI - exactly the specialty visit I expected. Also, everyone was friendly & I really didn't wait at all.|Dr Thurman was great, professional patient and just absolutely great THANK YOU!|This Doctor does not mess around.

It is the best place to go for chiropractic, massage, and physical therapy.
The Spine & Injury Clinic has been with me through 3 back surgeries. Starting in 2016 to present. I don't know where I would be without David Milam, Catlin Fairfield, Natalie Motor and her assistant Maddie. They helped get me where I needed to be to set me up for success for my 3rd back surgery September of this year and they have been there for me as I recover. Thanks to this amazing team of people my recovery is going to have the best outcome possible. My care team is hands down the best and they are incredible people.
The office ladies have been amazing as well, helping me get scheduled and rescheduling if need be. The office ladies are polite, kind, and wonderful.

Her treatment plan is challenging, but it's helping me focus and has already improved my strength and stability and reduce my chronic pain! I didn't want basic PT...I wanted sports/functional-fitness focused PT and that's what Natalie provides!|Great staff! The pain is gone and I can go back to work. I particularly enjoyed the needle work. Thanks to David and the team.|I had a bilateral knee replacement five months ago. The first two weeks sucked, but now I'm back to full speed.

That is how it is with other doctor offices.|Dr. Singer really saved my son's life - he had a C6 fracture of the spine from a car accident, had C5-7 fused, and was in constant pain.  Dr. Singer was able to do an adjustment that gave him relief.  Since then, he has been our go-to provider, and the people in his office are always pleasant to work with!|Dr. Singer is one heckuva good guy. I enjoyed my visit with him and my treatment so I will probably be back sometime again to have some more done.|The first time I saw Dr. Singer was 9 years ago when I was going through one of the most difficult times in my life.  I felt absolutely horrible and I was getting nowhere trying to figure things out with my traditional doctors.  Thankfully, I found Dr. Singer and he helped me get back on track and feeling better in no time. He listens, he cares, he's extremely intelligent, professional and proficient at what he does.  It's remarkable how quickly he can get to the bottom of root causes affecting our health. He's the best doctor I've ever found...honestly a gift to his patients.|Dr Singer, DO is one of the most patient people I know.  He is very helpful, straight to the point, and willing to work with his patients. He is willing to listen to new information and lays out all your options so you can choose what you want to do about your health.|Appointments with Dr. Singer are very through and address any concerns or changes, referencing past history and labs. I am always grateful to have him as my physician.|Like nothing I've ever experienced!  I believe he is going to help me!!!  Wonderful personality too and his nurse is very friendly and encouraging. I definitely recommend!|My visit at  Dr. Singer's office was a pleasant experience. His commitment to patient care and his patients well being is truly commendable. Dr. Singer,.  I can't thank you enough for the excellent care you have. provided.

I woke up serious knee pain, I couldn't get in with my surgeon who I planned on having knee replacement with but was told they take walk-ins here.  Dr. Levene said all he could was a cortisone shot and told my wife and I it WOULD NOT delay surgery so I got the shot.  After he left he sent the handyman in with different size J-braces to try, which didn't address my issues anyway.  I saw my surgeon the next week who said 3 months to surgery now.  I've been taken by mechanics before but not a doctor.  To make it worse it pushed me after the new year and had to start over on my deductible.|Dr. DiPompeo was wonderful.

The most recent review on here as well as the other negative reviews sadden and anger me. We have been going here for over 10 years and they are hands down the ONLY people I would go to, trust or recommend to anyone! I have recommended people to them and they all loved them as well. I feel like these negative reviews are coming from people who must have done something HORRIBLE to be asked to find another provider. There are very specific rules in place when getting treatment and you would have to be doing something VERY wrong to get kicked off treatment. And even if that happened I know that NOT ONE of them would leave someone to die or in pain and would help find somewhere else to treat you if you did break your contract unless YOU treated them with absolute disrespect! These ladies and Hammond are AMAZING! Jaime, Sarah, Todd, Naomi and Tristan are the best staff and have become family to us! I love them all so much and I know for a fact they ALL deserve respect and kindness as they deal with ALOT! of grumpy, upset people in pain daily and still have smiles, kindness, compassion and grace! They are all rock stars and DO NOT! deserve ANY of these bad reviews or to be bad mouthed! Thank you Summit staff for making us part of your family and caring for us in our times of need! You simply are the best!|I was seeing Kidder for 3.5years, she had me on a narcotic. All cuz I didn't get blood work done, cuz my life went chaotic from having an infected tooth to being kicked out of my home, she cut all my medication off and refused to give me anything for withdrawals. Also to top it all off Naomi the receptionist there, is friends with my daughters dad who is my ex. He somehow found out that I was going there and what medication I was on. She violated HIPPA laws. Do not go there unless you like drama or almost dying. You can't have someone on something for 3.5years and then just cut them off without putting them in serious risk.|Summit pain clinic does an amazing job managing pain.

Kim at the Front Desk was welcoming. Devina in Admissions was friendly & professional and kept me informed of the wait time. Procedure nurse Jess (RN) was very knowledgeable, professional and attentive. Recovery nurse Stephani (RN) was caring & had a great bedside manner - she helped me walk back to the front desk after my procedure when I was still a little groggy. Scott the Anesthesiologist had me under in less than a minute. Thank you to Vicky (Tech), Kim (RN) and Sarah (RN) as well. Such a pleasant experience. Thanks again everybody!

Dr H kept trying to get all these off the wall Procedures done and thank God my insurance company said no. Something happened to me in my life recently and something bad happened to me. Instead of talking to me about what happened they stopped helping with the one thing that helped Me have some what of a normal life. They can make this right. But I'm sure they won't choose to.

I will recommend this doctor to anyone dealing with pain.|This Review is for the Modesto location.Most of the staff is nice. But the doctor's treatment is very disappointing. They kind of act like everyone who comes in is just looking for drugs. I've always had negative drug tests and I've come to them in extreme pain, only to be prescribed Tylenol or ibuprofen. I don't need to see a doctor for medication I could get over the counter. The doctors are very dismissive even when told multiple times that Tylenol and ibuprofen don't work.

I've been a patient for years and had 5 surgeries with them. In the last several months they have dramatically changed their policies to block patients from getting care in any sort of reasonable timeframe, leaving them in pain for an unethical amount of time. Today I was informed that all Botox services would cease after I've spent weeks trying to get my routine treatment and jumping through countless hoops for them. They have no plan, no referrals, no support for patients that have been having this pain service with them for years. I can't fathom how they think this is the way to treat patients.|Worst office experience. If you don't care if you personal information is yelled across the lobby, ok. Or that the scheduling staff cancels appointments without letting you know, please this may be your place. I let the staff know this was not ok with me. Oh, and they had another patient getting mad cuz he had to wait. He got so mad, after he growled at me that it was my fault (ha!) try blaming the appropriate people dude! Plus he was using curse words. Did the staff do anything?  Nope. So go here is you are a Masochist.  This is my story and my opinion.|I was refered by my doctor to this place and I go make an appointment the pa saw me and said they would approve my Botox treatment and to wait for the insurance to approve it. They said it takes 7-10 business days for it to be approved. I call them after two weeks since I did not hear from them.

They told me it was still pending with my insurance.

I call the insurance company and they said there was not even a pending authorization.

I call them back and they said someone would call me back and they never did. I repeat call backs and I go to there office and it was closed during normal business hours.

Finally someone says they will call me back. Someone did call me and and I missed there call. They said they no longer go through insurance for Botox even though they advertise it on there website.

They said they can send it off for a prescription or something to that effect on the voice mail they left me.

I have called the main office and there authorization department at least six times at each line and no one will call me back.

I have never had such poor customer service from a doctor's office.

No one has since called me back. If they would have just called me back and let me know they don't provide that service that would have been fine. But they can't even do that.

Mind you I am in pain waiting for them to reply.

If you want terrible customer service and for them to never call you back go see them. The worst doctors office I've ever been to. If I could give zero stars I would.|1st appt went well, got in to see a PA who was great. She wanted more time to go over my complex case, and made an appt with me for today.

Yesterday I got a call from a woman at the clinic who told me I needed to show up 15 min early today to fill out their new intake. I said ""As long as it isn't Phreesia."" She replied it was. I told her I don't sign away my medical info to 3rd parties who resell it.

She then cancelled my appt for today. Either I allow my data to be sold, or I cannot get pain management. I asked to speak to the mgr and even called back an hour later, never got a return call.

Shame, I really thought this was a service of compassionate providers. Instead it is gatekeepers who must be getting a cut from Phreesia for giving up patient data.

Ironically my Allergist is next door, they have had Phreesia 2 years but appropriately opted me out when I asked.

TLDR: Providers seem great, staff is anything but.
*********
After going into the office and asking for a manager callback (I am seen at a provider in the same building who has opted me out of Phreesia for 2 years) I got one the following day.

The manager does not believe me that Phreesia sells medical data to pharmaceutical companies for targeted advertising. It is openly on their website.

She refused to allow me to have any follow-up care in this clinic simply because I need to protect my PHI. There was no exception made, no matter how I offered to do the paperwork.

As a disabled veteran, my PHI is tied to my income. Access to one means access to benefits info. I cannot risk that. Not even for much needed pain management.

When you begin to question the ethics of a pain management clinic, you wonder where else they fall short in their ethics and business practices.
Reduced to 1 star because it won't let me do 0.|Zero stars.
I had an appointment for 8:00 a.m. The receptionist who made the appointment, Miguel, called me the day before to confirm and instructed me to arrive at 7:45 a.m. to fill out paperwork which I did. At 8:30 I asked him if he knew how much longer it would be because I had another appointment. He told me my appointment wasn't until 9:00.
I let him know he had called to confirm my 8:00 appointment with me the day before and had asked me to arrive at 7:45 to fill out paperwork.
He then said sorry, I was wondering why you were here so early for your appointment.
I then told him again, my appointment was at 8:00 and he had confirmed that fact with me yesterday. He did not attempt to have me seen, he just said sorry again.
Don't waste your time with this office.|First off the location is not the best for those who have severe pain and difficulty walking. Arrived for my appointment 15 minutes early as requested so I could fill out paperwork. Arrived and there wasn't a person in sight other than another patient waiting.  While waiting for someone to show up and help me another person walked in. And then another. Finally someone was at the receptionist desk and I started walking up and he rudely said he was just looking something up. He then proceeded to check in the 3rd person that walked in, then took the second person to the back after checking her in. I then get called back by a doctor, I think his name started with an H, who then proceeds to talk to me about my situation while firmly stating he would not allow me any pain meds (I have severe pain and nothing has helped aside from pain medication) . I scoffed at him after realizing this guy doesn't want to help me with my pain, he simply wants to inject me or do an epidural, even though when all was said and done, he told me he wasn't sure their kind of treatment would work for me since he is doubting my diagnosis. He was knowledgeable, but definitely looking out for his pocket instead his patients. Then AFTER this consultation He had me do vitals my blood pressure was high, but I was in extreme pain. The person who did my vitals had no idea how to pronounce any of my medications. Vitals took almost 15 minutes. Anyway, this is not the place for me. Unfriendly and incompetent staff, dirty and extremely cold waiting room. Would not recommend if you have serious pain issues.|I've been going to Dr Mozingo (Pacific Pain)for over 20 years. He has the best diagnostic skills. The other Drs are very skilled , attentive to your health care. Well being is there goal for their patients.
I'd highly recommend any of the practicing Pain therapist.|Dr. Roshan was excellent! He did a great job explaining the procedure we are considering including the pros and cons. And he was a wonderful listener, taking the time to answer all our questions. We didn't feel rushed like he had other things to do. A very pleasant experience!",2025-01-08|2025-01-08|2024-11-17|2024-08-21|2024-04-17|2024-01-10|2023-11-24|2019-11-25,1|1|1|1|1|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJNyeA7mbx7IAR2mQSmEjEg-c,124

I sincerely appreciate this office, and everyone who works there!!!|I have been seeing Roxanne PAC since 2010. Her and all of the other doctors at CRPM have all been very attentive and caring to my specific pain issues. Then my 3 spinal surgeries happened and they worked closely with my spine surgeon. I very much like CRPM. I have recommended them to my bf and he is now a happy patient. Thanks everyone. Merry Christmas.|I have been a patient of CRPM for several years to treat chronic spine pain and everyone there has been outstanding in every way.

The Doctors are compassionate, knowledgeable, and will explain any changes in care, medication, or injury at a level that can be understood without trivializing the injury or your comprehension.

If you're in pain I would highly recommend Centers of Rehabilitation and Pain Medicine.|I recently visited CRPM Medical and had an incredibly positive experience. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was welcoming.

**Tina** at the front desk deserves special recognition. Her professionalism and warm demeanor immediately put me at ease during what can often be a stressful experience. She was efficient in handling paperwork and made sure I was well-informed about my wait time, which was surprisingly short.

The medical staff at CRPM Medical are equally commendable. They provided thorough explanations of procedures, listened attentively to my concerns, and treated me with the utmost respect and care. The facility itself is clean, modern, and well-organized, which adds to the overall comfort of the visit.

What stood out to me was not just the medical treatment but the genuine compassion shown by everyone especially  PA-C Manuel. The front desk to the medical team. It's clear that CRPM Medical values patient care deeply.

Dr Kim was ok,  recommended a procedure for me that required authorization from my insurance. 2.5 months later and the staff can't seem to get it together to submit all my info to the insurance company even after I have called and email several times and gotten reassurances that they are going to do it.
It took a month to get my appointment scheduled and another couple to get in to see the Dr. I drove 1.5 hours to get there by 9am and still waited an hour to see the Dr. In the meantime one woman came in for her appt only to be told she didn't have one. She produced the card they gave her with the date and time on it so they squeezed her in. Another woman came in with receipts from every bill she paid in the previous year because they were double charging her for a couple visits. You will be required to take a pee test for drugs.

His office is great at following up with all the appointments and make sure we don't miss any.

Only one suggestion for the clinic: if they can do some tele-meds for patients that don't need to be in the clinic physically, such as treatment follow up visit, etc., that would be even better.|Great place.

I've been a patient for years and had 5 surgeries with them. In the last several months they have dramatically changed their policies to block patients from getting care in any sort of reasonable timeframe, leaving them in pain for an unethical amount of time. Today I was informed that all Botox services would cease after I've spent weeks trying to get my routine treatment and jumping through countless hoops for them. They have no plan, no referrals, no support for patients that have been having this pain service with them for years. I can't fathom how they think this is the way to treat patients.|Worst office experience. If you don't care if you personal information is yelled across the lobby, ok. Or that the scheduling staff cancels appointments without letting you know, please this may be your place. I let the staff know this was not ok with me. Oh, and they had another patient getting mad cuz he had to wait. He got so mad, after he growled at me that it was my fault (ha!) try blaming the appropriate people dude! Plus he was using curse words. Did the staff do anything?  Nope. So go here is you are a Masochist.  This is my story and my opinion.|I was refered by my doctor to this place and I go make an appointment the pa saw me and said they would approve my Botox treatment and to wait for the insurance to approve it. They said it takes 7-10 business days for it to be approved. I call them after two weeks since I did not hear from them.

They told me it was still pending with my insurance.

I call the insurance company and they said there was not even a pending authorization.

I call them back and they said someone would call me back and they never did. I repeat call backs and I go to there office and it was closed during normal business hours.

Finally someone says they will call me back. Someone did call me and and I missed there call. They said they no longer go through insurance for Botox even though they advertise it on there website.

They said they can send it off for a prescription or something to that effect on the voice mail they left me.

I have called the main office and there authorization department at least six times at each line and no one will call me back.

I have never had such poor customer service from a doctor's office.

No one has since called me back. If they would have just called me back and let me know they don't provide that service that would have been fine. But they can't even do that.

Mind you I am in pain waiting for them to reply.

If you want terrible customer service and for them to never call you back go see them. The worst doctors office I've ever been to. If I could give zero stars I would.|1st appt went well, got in to see a PA who was great. She wanted more time to go over my complex case, and made an appt with me for today.

Yesterday I got a call from a woman at the clinic who told me I needed to show up 15 min early today to fill out their new intake. I said ""As long as it isn't Phreesia."" She replied it was. I told her I don't sign away my medical info to 3rd parties who resell it.

She then cancelled my appt for today. Either I allow my data to be sold, or I cannot get pain management. I asked to speak to the mgr and even called back an hour later, never got a return call.

Shame, I really thought this was a service of compassionate providers. Instead it is gatekeepers who must be getting a cut from Phreesia for giving up patient data.

Ironically my Allergist is next door, they have had Phreesia 2 years but appropriately opted me out when I asked.

TLDR: Providers seem great, staff is anything but.
*********
After going into the office and asking for a manager callback (I am seen at a provider in the same building who has opted me out of Phreesia for 2 years) I got one the following day.

The manager does not believe me that Phreesia sells medical data to pharmaceutical companies for targeted advertising. It is openly on their website.

She refused to allow me to have any follow-up care in this clinic simply because I need to protect my PHI. There was no exception made, no matter how I offered to do the paperwork.

As a disabled veteran, my PHI is tied to my income. Access to one means access to benefits info. I cannot risk that. Not even for much needed pain management.

When you begin to question the ethics of a pain management clinic, you wonder where else they fall short in their ethics and business practices.
Reduced to 1 star because it won't let me do 0.|Zero stars.
I had an appointment for 8:00 a.m. The receptionist who made the appointment, Miguel, called me the day before to confirm and instructed me to arrive at 7:45 a.m. to fill out paperwork which I did. At 8:30 I asked him if he knew how much longer it would be because I had another appointment. He told me my appointment wasn't until 9:00.
I let him know he had called to confirm my 8:00 appointment with me the day before and had asked me to arrive at 7:45 to fill out paperwork.
He then said sorry, I was wondering why you were here so early for your appointment.
I then told him again, my appointment was at 8:00 and he had confirmed that fact with me yesterday. He did not attempt to have me seen, he just said sorry again.
Don't waste your time with this office.|First off the location is not the best for those who have severe pain and difficulty walking. Arrived for my appointment 15 minutes early as requested so I could fill out paperwork. Arrived and there wasn't a person in sight other than another patient waiting.  While waiting for someone to show up and help me another person walked in. And then another. Finally someone was at the receptionist desk and I started walking up and he rudely said he was just looking something up. He then proceeded to check in the 3rd person that walked in, then took the second person to the back after checking her in. I then get called back by a doctor, I think his name started with an H, who then proceeds to talk to me about my situation while firmly stating he would not allow me any pain meds (I have severe pain and nothing has helped aside from pain medication) . I scoffed at him after realizing this guy doesn't want to help me with my pain, he simply wants to inject me or do an epidural, even though when all was said and done, he told me he wasn't sure their kind of treatment would work for me since he is doubting my diagnosis. He was knowledgeable, but definitely looking out for his pocket instead his patients. Then AFTER this consultation He had me do vitals my blood pressure was high, but I was in extreme pain. The person who did my vitals had no idea how to pronounce any of my medications. Vitals took almost 15 minutes. Anyway, this is not the place for me. Unfriendly and incompetent staff, dirty and extremely cold waiting room. Would not recommend if you have serious pain issues.|I've been going to Dr Mozingo (Pacific Pain)for over 20 years. He has the best diagnostic skills. The other Drs are very skilled , attentive to your health care. Well being is there goal for their patients.

I understand that however my past doctors would do Urine test , labs and prescriptions all on the same visit and if there was an issue with your urine this would be addressed on your follow up appointment. The pain clinic wanted me to wait another two weeks for another appointment. My primary requested the urine results. After 20 minutes my primary comes back in the room and says "" There's no issues "" with the urine and I'll be writing a bridge script  for you and he did . Just be careful with them because if there is ever any issues they will just ignore you and then wonder why you leave . I have my original pain management back .

He is always about keeping you pain free healthy.|I think I have been treated by JZ and Dr. Doraiswamy for about 10 years. Everyone in the office are courteous and very helpful.

I originally saw Dr. Doraiswamy and was switched over Jz a few years ago. I love all of the staff. Even when I had to have  a prior authorization my insurance was taking forever, so they office was able to call directly and get the authorization done. I think they go above and beyond. I believe a lot of the bad reviews on here are due to people doing drugs illegally and they get caught when drug tested. Just something to keep in mind when reading these reviews.|This pain clinic is the best so far i have ever been. They are professional, polite, kind and curtious. They go the extra mile when handling their job duties. Dr Anylou is one of the best at her job. She builds a kind relationship with her patients and makes you can't wait to revisit again because her and her staff Bertha,Denise, and Kathy makes you feel like family. Im confident in her decisions. I thank the entire staff for being such wonderful people.|I have been going to the pain clinic for 4 years and have only had great results. The staff is so friendly and they truly care about each and every patient! J.Z. is my doctor and he is a top notch doctor. He talks to you and listens to you. He is very caring.

For almost 10 years now and have had at least 100 different procedures and have always respected the care and professionalism from the entire staff to Dr KY himself have gone above and beyond the normal expected from a doctor and their entire staff.|When I came to Dr. Paul Ky I was in a wheelchair I was frightened for anybody to get near my left arm and I wouldn't let nobody touch me. Dr.Ky begin to treat me with his injections I was not even able to stand up past two minutes I now am out of the wheelchair using a walker and since then I had a stimulator thank you Dr. Paul Ky for giving me back my life.|I have severe neck issues in constant pain !!!! I have never went into a Drs office with a pain level 9-10 .... and left with no pain ? This Dr Paul Ky, was the most down to earth Dr I have ever meet he explained my diagnosis in words I could understand! He gave me Great advice and Opinions ! I am so Grateful to be 1 of his patients!!!!! I don't plan on going anywhere! I highly recommend
Dr.Paul Ky, DO.|My first visit with the PA I was very impressed and also with Doctor once I met him for the first time. They were very thorough and asking their questions about where the pain was how it felt and their goal was to find the root of the problem of the pain. Tests were ordered. It took a couple months. We found what the problem was and referrals were done to the doctors that can help. Unfortunately
it requires surgery. And that aspect I give them a 10 They are great! The only problem I have was every single month I had a problem getting my prescriptions to help with the pain I was constantly calling in every month and requesting with the pharmacy to call in the script to get my prescription. I'm hoping soon that this will be resolved. Of course when I left a message I always asked him to recurring my call and update me on the status I never got a call back. Other than getting my prescriptions timely,  I love the doctors. I'm so glad that my general doctor referred me to them.|Dr. KY is the best at what he does.  Very knowledgeable and explains everything very clearly.   The front office can be rude at times and unprofessional.  The gossiping and standing around while patients are waiting to be helped at the front window.   I had asked a question about the co-payment that had not been asked for before.  It was like talking to a dear in headlights.  They had no clue and did not offer to ask billing about it.  At that time it came up that I had been accumulating charges for one full year.  Not once did I receive a bill nor was it brought to my attention until I had asked about the co-payment.  It's ashame Dr. KY does not have a front office staff equivalent to his knowledge and understanding.|I have been going to Advanced Pain Solutions for well over 10 year's. Dr.Ky still cares about my pain and doesn't give up on me! The staff is incredibly sweet and get things done! It has to be so hard always listening to patients complain all day. The staff never makes you feel like you're a burden!  Thanks guys!|Very nice man and spent an inordinate amount of time testing and documenting every flexible joint in my body. It was really bad news. But he only injected my R rotator cuff with something to dull the pain there. Which it did for all of three days when it was supposed to be effective until my next appointment!  I've had similar injections in my lumbar region that resulted in similar results. Two days numbing of pain. By fifth day , back to same pain. Next to worthless. I won't do it again.|Great job !!

While you see the employee talking laughing casually while you're frustrated in an overly pack waiting room.|Amazing doctor without him I wouldn't have known I needed surgery.
Thank you, Dr. Salazar.|I was seen on 5/6/24 as a new patient on a referral from my primary care physician because I have been experiencing severe lower back pain. Upon arrival I noticed that the doctors office stays fairly full. All my registration papery was done online for an 8:45 appointment I was called back to the room at 9:30. No heart rate taken, no blood pressure taken and no weight taken. The amount of patients in and out and only seeing doctor Salazar it seems as if he really didn't spend much time with the patients which was a concern for me as I have multiple health issues and a team of doctors at Stanford. As I waited in the room I was so optimistic that I was going to be on the road to pain relief and better mobility to enjoy my family and outdoor activities. Dr. Salazar entered the room introduced himself and pulled up my pain chart in which I had circled my areas of pain. He then asked what kind of work do I do, I explained I'm disabled and worked up until 2015 due to a brain injury in 2013. He asked while working what kind of work did I do and I began to explain to him the work I did involved lots of heavy lifting. I then started to give him information about my back telling him that while employed I had an incident where I had a spasm in my back while at work was taken to hospital by ambulance given muscle relaxer by IV and back to work in 2 days. I had X-ray and all necessary treatments to determine if there was anything else wrong and there was not. At this point doctor Salazar stopped me and said he can't see me until I bring a release of my settlement which I tried to explain to him there was no case, no settlement, no fury treatment needed because I had a muscle spasm. He no longer wanted to hear about my medical as it pertains to my visit all he said was if he's supposed to be paid by workers comp and he's paid by my insurance at this point he said he can't see me until I bring a worker's comp release. I have no release there was no case and I was referred by my primary care and this was not a comp claim. As I sat there trying to explain he shut the computer down closed my file and said follow me, I'm still sitting there in shock because I've never been treated this way he then turned around and said louder follow me and walked me out! I'm still in disbelief and when I got to my car I called my husband and cried! He was not at all interested in my medical history or anything else. It was clear he wanted nothing to do with me other than getting me in and out. He doesn't have time for a new patient as he doesn't have the time to spend with the patient. At the front desk I explained to the receptionist I'm not sure what just happened and I immediately contacted my primary care physician. I prayed about what happened to me yesterday and was going to just move on but I received an email survey from doctor Salazar's office this morning. I decided to open it and complete the survey which was questions and answers only ( agree, disagree, etc) once I completed the survey I was hoping to find an area to elaborate on my experience but there was not! So that's why I decided to leave a review. If you are a new patient with multiple health issues like myself, I have heart issues, blood pressure issues as well as autonomic issues that I will deal with for the rest of my life from a brain injury. With that being said my health care team has to have time to properly communicate with me as well as time to communicate with my physicians at Stanford as this is critical in my healthcare and doctor Salazar clearly doesn't have the time for that. I am thankful for this platform to put my experience out there as I have learned that I have to be proactive in my healthcare.|Dr Salazar has been my pain management physician since 1998. Over the years he has treated me I have NO complaints. His has an outstanding staff who are attentive to the patients needs. Dr is always up on the state of the art ways to treat his patients. I highly recommend Dr to my family, friends and anyone who will listen. Often while waiting, which is never long, the patients will talk to each other about the treatments they are receiving. It is wonderful to have a group chat with people who understand and have pain as an issue in their life. To top it off there is always candy on your way out.|I get my pain pump refilled here every month. I love these doctors and their staff. Each and every one in the office is pleasant to work with. I've been coming here over 5 years and have received excellent care every time I've had an appointment. I really appreciate their continued social distancing and mask  wearing and enforcement of the same for all of their staff and patients. I really like having all services available to me at one place... billing, labs, surgical services, and regular appointments. I couldn't ask for a better place to receive my regular care.|I have been a patient of the center starting 1999 when Dr Kalamakarian was the Dr formerly called San Juaquin valley pain management center with PA Mr. . Mr Johncox is excellent with a relaxed great bedside manner he always listens to my level of pain and where it stems from. He is knowledgeable professional and easy to talk to thank you!  I have seen him also close to 22 years. Dr Salazar took over and he is a great doctor with a funny relaxing manner and has done many epidural injections that were successful along with monthly pain pump refills. I trust them all 100%. Their entire staff the medical assistants are always friendly and I enjoy seeing them for my monthly visits. The entire office staff is very professional and friendly I would never go anywhere else for my chronic spinal pain treatment.|The staff and doctors at Dr. Salazar's office have always shown me much respect and care!! They have shown the utmost in professionalism and excellent medical care!!  I have had the privilege of being a patient at Dr. Salazar's advanced pain management team for eight-plus years. My comfort and needs from my monthly appointments to my medical care have always shown to be their number one concern.|My name is m.j iqbal, i was a pt.with dr. Salazar for several years.  He cares for his patients.   He tries his best to see that his patients are pain free by prescribing the right meds, injections and physical therapy.  His staff is very courteous and helpful.

-After X-rays of

-back
-spine
Just could not figure it out!
So treatment of anesthesia and shots of a  dont remember drug, then the prescription of Vicodin.
All better now. NOT!
Its the Mayo clinic they are the best, really punched up my Blue Cross PPO, and co-pay. Cha-ching$$$$$
Moving forward - 2 years later in Arizona,lots of booze, vicodin, excruciating PAIN, Headaches, nausea, call ambulance.
No a US Marine does not,( I drive) to the Phoenix,AZ Veterans Hospital which the media talked crap about!
Pain killers waiting at the ER Door. X-ray neck (and MRI from outsourced Mayo$$$)
ER Doctor shows me Xray and says see that little itty bitty piece of shrapnel or something in your spine/neck? Is hitting the main nerve on your Left side, creating, all the above problems.
An ER Doctor from the supposed shitty VA Hospital figured it out in 10 minutes!
So no the Mayo clinic (TREATS) NOT CURES SHIT!
This is why there is a line out the door every 1st of the month for pain meds at MAYO!
Kudos to the VA Hospital, and to the Navy Neuro Surgeon, informed me yes surgery can fix , but may never walk again, Honesty!
So do I  recommend the MAYO, No !|Absolutely the best Dr. and Staff from the front office to the Nurses, They are very awsome.|Love Dr. Grewel and his staff. They're so kind and supportive. The SCS procedure I recently had is working like a charm!|Overall experience was good. Doctor answered all my questions. The only issue for me was the wait time. My appointment was at 10am. I checked in at 9:52am and was seen by the doctor at 11am. I only saw one other patient with me at the lobby who came in after me and he was seen first. I'll still come back to the clinic though.|I've only been in the building 1 time. The Dr. I saw was really helpful and nice. The staff members were nice as well.|Honestly it too soon to give a proper rating. Just had my procedure done yesterday.  I was in and out quickly and the staff was very nice.

They got a fast approval from my provider and I was in that week. That in it self is great. When your in pain getting treated quickly is needed and appreciated.

Now just hoping this will elevate my pain and discomfort.

He and his team gave me my life back!

Dr. Prager listened to me and directly, empathetically, and confidently, explained a clear plan. He gave me hope!  Dr. Prager with his team, and Kelly, his knowledgeable and patient Nurse Practitioner, set about getting my pain under control. They never let me go. Dr. Prager and his team are truely outstanding in the field of pain management.|I've been a patient of the California Pain Medicine Center for almost 25 years. From the doctors to the nurse practitioners and front office, they all deserve five stars. Dr. Prager and Dr. Barnard are caring physicians on the cutting edge of new research and treatments. Erica Jenkins, the nurse practitioner, deserves ten stars. She goes out of her way to provide every patient with the very best care and treatment. She listens! The front office, (especially Andrew and Itxayana) deserve a special shout out for all their organization of appointments and procedures. Trust me when I say they fight insurance companies for the procedures patients need. I am blessed to have this entire team in my corner.|Note: It has been 10 YEARS (!!!) since I wrote this review! Dr Prager is still my pain doctor and has never failed his promise to take care of my pain ....  so I could have a better life

Dr. Prager opened his new practice, California Pain Medicine, in Santa Monica several years ago and we followed him there

As far as I'm concerned, no other pain doctor comes close to Dr. Prager. You can look up his impressive credentials, his education, professional alliances, his medical and surgical experience. I will relate my personal experience.

When I first saw Dr. Prager, I was laying in a reclining wheelchair, shaking in pain. I had a heating pad on my abdomen and ice packs all around my pelvis. I have a severe form of interstitial cystitis (which destroys the lining of the bladder) and pudendal neuralgia, for which there is no cure and no effective treatment. I had been ill for over 15 years, gradually declining until I was bedridden for the last three years. I could not walk, sit, or even stand. The pain was relentless, day and night, and I was at the end of my rope.

However, as Dr. Prager started talking, I began to feel a glimmer of hope. He really seemed to understand the kind of pain I was in, and my confidence grew as he outlined a plan that would possibly give me back my life. Out of all the doctors and specialists, and after all the failed treatments and surgeries -- Dr. Prager was the one who finally helped me.

It has been more than two years since I had the surgery that gave me back my life. In November of 2012, Dr. Prager implanted an intrathecal pain pump into my abdomen. It contains a mixture of three medications which drip slowly into my spinal fluid and, to put it simply, anesthetize (deaden) the pain signals. We knew it would work because a trial with the same medications a month earlier had been an astounding success. I remember SITTING without pain for the first time in 4-5 years, and WALKING, by myself, around the nurses station at least 7 times!

Today I am walking, laughing, and enjoying life. I can go places, eat at restaurants, see the latest movies. My husband and my sister, who were there during the darkest hours, cry tears of joy when they see me happy and doing things. My husband has  been known to get misty-eyed simply from coming home from work and finding me in the kitchen cooking dinner.|I have been in pain management for over 12 years due to a chronic long term illness. I saw the same great pain management practice since diagnosis. I moved to CA in February. I reached out to California Pain Medicine Center and Dr Gabriel Barnard even before I moved so, I  would have no lapse in care. Dr Barnard has been so great in continuing my care with much empathy, passion and understanding. His office staff have also been extremely nice and helpful, and they answer the phone and get back to me quickly anytime I need something. I 100% + recommend California Pain Medicine Center for anyone needing excellent care.|Dr Barnard is great.   He is very attentive and thorough.    I didn't feel rushed which I really appreciated.  Fingers crossed that I can finally get relief from the pain.|This review is very long overdue. I should have written this a while ago. Dr. Prager, nurse practitioner Erica Jenkins, Dr. Barnard and their team are the best in their field. I have been to my fair share of pain management doctors over the years. Dr. Prager and Erica, by far, provide the best and most thorough care to the point where they supersede expectations. They truly listen, ask questions, and take their time. They never finish an appointment if there are any remaining questions or concerns. They have improved my quality of life beyond what I had achieved with other practitioners. I wish Erica was my primary provider. She deserves gold stars for everything she does. They are all a wealth of knowledge and so caring. It has been an honor and pleasure to be under their care. It has been a true blessing.
I've had consults and a procedure with Dr. Barnard. He and his team were also equally great. If I need another procedure, I would only want Dr. Barnard from here on.
The office staff are also so nice, patient, friendly, and efficient.
I wholeheartedly recommend this practice. They are amazing.|Went to UCLA Med Center where Dr Gabriel Barnard treated my torn left shoulder with a temporary electronic implant to see if it helps the pain.  Hopefully it will work and a permanent implant can be used.  I will update the status of yesterday's procedure when I follow up with Dr B next Friday.

I have great confidence in the skill and judgment of Dr Barnard and his staff as I have been treated like the most important person in the world and cared for with a very high level of competence and compassion.

I am hopeful that I get relief from severe pain and I very much appreciate Dr Barnard's honest assessment of my issues telling me the procedure should provide relief but realistically it probably won't be 100% pain free.

I am very grateful for this procedure being tested on me since my condition does not allow for surgical repair of the torn shoulder.

I am happy to answer any questions regarding the procedure and my treatment under Dr Barnard.  Just know that I would not have this procedure performed by anyone other than Dr Barnard.

Sincerely

Michael Rosenthal
Woodland Hills CA
July 8, 2023|Dr Barnard is an empathetic and knowledgeable doctor who really listens to the patient. I'm currently receiving stellate ganglion block injections to treat CRPS. I've had 4 injections so far over the course of 2 months, and they have gradually been reducing the inflammation and pain in my wrist and hand. It's important to communicate clearly to the doctor so that he can adjust his course of treatment accordingly. CRPS is tricky to treat and before each injection Dr Barnard checks in with me to discuss how things are progressing and then determines his next course of action. During each procedure, Dr Barnard describes exactly what he is going to do step by step. He adjusts the amount of medication according to what he determines will be most effective. I feel very well cared for and reassured that I will recover from CRPS.",2025-01-08|2024-08-02|2024-09-20|2024-06-14|2024-09-20|2023-11-27|2023-07-09|2023-11-17,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJAQDwKIS8woARO-o7PqTy-Ss,54

They don't care, they don't put your script in as they are supposed to. The only way to get through is to show up in person. I've literally been on hold for 4 hours and decided to just go in and see what the issue was. Not 1 staff member was busy, not one staff member was answering any phone calls. I talked to the front office staff to get my prescription sent to the pharmacy and showed them I'm still on hold, and that it's been over 4 hours. All they said was. Oh, we're sorry.

Thank you Dr. Malek for the time and care! I will recommend you to others.|Dr Malek is excellent with all the procedures that Ive had with him. From the beginning I was limping and in pain, now i am not limping and with little to no pain! The doctor and staff are fantastic. The progress with this doctor and amazing and he cares about me. He is the best pain management doctor I've had and I highly recommended. The assistant helping me always with my questions and working with me to feel very comfortable. Signed Joyce Acquaah|The staff is VERY attentive and helpful. Dr. Malik is caring and knowledge about everything I told him about. I went in to the office for a consult - but I was in such terrible pain, he got right to me! I left feeling SO much better! My second visit was equally as productive. There are many doctors that go through a routine, but Dr. Malik and his staff are quality people who really care about their patients. Do not be turned off about the location, a visit to his office will have you feeling better and hopeful about your recovery!|Thank you to the good doctor that knows and understands about my pain. I'm glad that this was the right place to be sent to for my situation of pain. Doctor staff and nurses are very nice. The clinic is small but, it is very advanced. People like me should look into this clinic to see if they need any pain management help. Doctor Malek went ahead and talked with me about different choices I had. We went ahead and did a injection procedure on my back and it turned out great rather than just taking medicine and pills.|Dr. Malek and his staff are unbelievable!  When I started going to him I had a lot of problems with pain and depression he made me hopeful.  I've never seen a doctor  care for his patients like he does,it made me feel supported.  I recommend him for any pain,depression and more.  His Ketamine program is highly recommended as well.  You will not be disappointed with Interventional Anesthesia & Pain Management Clinic.  I went in with so much pain which started me to have depression and is leaving with hardly any pain.  I know everyone is different but it worked for me.|I met and conferred with Dr. Malek and his very lovely staff regarding significant pain and discomfort  that I was experiencing going down the left side of my body from my sciatica all the way to my ankle. He took his time with me and helped me to understand what was going on with my body. The staff then scheduled an appointment for me to come in for a pain management treatment. The appointment/treatment went so well that three and a half weeks later I virtually have no more pain. He is a miracle worker as far as I am concerned. I want anyone out there that is experiencing any sort of pain and distress should schedule an appointment with Dr. Malek and ascertain what he could do for you. I am totally sure that you won't be sorry. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dr Cheng is such a caring physician and I have to mention the team that does the injections and surgeries there, Hanna, Erika are all Amazing I highly recommend them all.|Dr Cheng's group at Elite Pain Management is awesome. I was referred to them by my Primary MD for neck pain. Instead of just assuming I had arthritis and putting me on yet more pain meds or other treatments, I was sent for an MRI. Dr Cheng personally called me as soon as he got the results letting me know that I had a large mass on my cervical spine. He spoke to me with care and compassion and referred me immediately to a wonderful Neurosurgeon and I had the mass removed ASAP. Thankfully my come has been very good! Dr Cheng always called back when I had questions and always made me feel cared about. Thank so much to Dr  Cheng and your wonderful staff!|Everyone was very cordial. My procedure was explained to me very well. It was difficult to get an appointment.|It's a very bad clinic. The front desk can't make an appointment for patients. It takes nearly two months to wait for the doctor's reply. Please stay away from this clinic.|I called to schedule an appointment so I could get some trigger point injections and it was definitely a different experience; they took my info including my insurance details and said they would call me back within the next few days after reviewing to let me know if they would accept me as a new patient... it was a bit odd that I couldn't schedule a consultation and I wasn't asked what I wanted to be seen for.

I will post back after hearing from them so readers can see the result of my experience.  Definitely a first for me with not being asked any qualifying questions.

The gal that I spoke to on the phone couldn't tell me what she meant by ""the doctor needs to review before scheduling an appointment""

Either way, I hope I at least get the question of what I'm looking to have done and what sort of treatments I need whether it be injections, medications, multi-modality, etc.|I had a terrible accident years ago that left me with chronic back pain, among other things. My back surgeon recommended Dr. Cheng at Elite Pain Management and it was the best thing that could have happened to me.

First, everyone in that office is wonderful. They truly care about my injury, about my life and they do everything they can to make sure I can live as normal and pain-free a life as possible.
Also, I have procedures on my back a couple of times a year. I just had one 6 days ago and I am already so much better. These procedures are not easy to say the least. Due to a brain injury that I sustained during the same accident that damaged my back, I am practically immune to sedation. Only general anesthesia works on me. Which means that during these procedures, I am fully awake and aware. The doctors here know this and they remember. Each time I have to have this done, they do everything in their power to make sure I am comfortable. They'll have conversations with me about my family, movies, things I've bought on Amazon. Whatever it takes to distract me. They are fast and incredibly efficient. And most importantly they are incredibly kind. I can't recommend them enough or be more grateful for all they do.|Everyone here at Elite Pain Management is superior to any other pain specialist I have seen.

His calm demeanor was welcoming after being seen by another doctor who was mean and didn't seem to care much if at all.
My insurance changed in the middle of obtaining the treatment that was needed.
After an almost three year break in treatment I started to decline.
I changed insurance carriers and was referred to Dr. Loomba once again.
After two months, I can honestly say I feel better. It's because of the treatment, injections and meds, but also the fact that I'm being seen by a provider who cares.
His staff is great as well.|They all treated me with such respect and explained everything as my procedure was being performed. My doctor was very accurate, informative, and attentive to all of my questions and concerns. I would 100% recommend this office to everyone, thank you again! I've waited almost a year for some pain relief, and kept getting the runaround everywhere else until I got to this wonderful office!|Dr. Loomba Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly admirable. Always goes above and beyond to ensure his patients receive the best care possible. Thank you|Dr. Loomba is a compssionate and caring Dr. The staff is very friendly and also caring to your concerns. Dr Loomba is the best pain specialist I have ever been too. He listens and takes his time with you, as though he is your friend. I definately would say go to him.|I am very pleased with dr. Lumba's care.
He took the time to come up with a plan for my care which is exactly what I have been looking for in a dr..
I thought I knew what my care should be and through his experience he took control of the situation and satisfied my need for actual health care.
Thank you Dr. Lumba|Dr. Loomba was very helpful at our intake appointment. He explained to me what was causing my hip/knee pain. We made a treatment plan. I'm hoping for less pain and a better night's sleep. I also want to keep up my exercise routine.|After many many years of trying to seek treatment elsewhere, I finally found a doctor and staff that are trying to help me with my chronic pain. Everyone here listens to my concerns and are helping me feel better.
Thank you|I would give zero stars if I could. This man does not listen or let me speak. He hasn't spoken to a single doctor of mine in the 9 months he's been treating me. My other physicians say they have reached out with no response. I believe them because they've done it in front of me and once I leave the building, I can't get ahold of anyone in the office either. Plus they kept me alive while I was a dying quadriplegic, so I trust them. Last week, he yelled at me in front of a resident and said, I don't care about your doctors appointment with your Neurologist. You can just find another pain management doctor. I have it recorded. It's crazy and that's it exactly, he just doesn't care. If it was one of his family members, I guarantee he would have made time to do his job. I have so much more but what's the point. My body is literally eating itself from the inside so I have to go through all of the hassle with insurance to start all over. Bottom line, if care about you or your loved one's health, do not go to Doctor Loomba.

She said ""no it's ok ill find it"" so she puts the needle in and keeps poking me. Trying to find the vein. She said ""there it is."" As I go in to the room I  take my shirt off lay face down on the table. The nurse picks up my arm and proceeds to administer the sedation. As she pushed in the sedation it didn't go into my veins it stayed between the skin and the vein on my forearm creating an instant searing sensation. I was screaming in pain crying after and after a few minutes they realized to put sailine to try to stop the pain. 2 minutes later they wheel me out and don't tell my fiance anything about what happened she was confused and didn't understand why I was in pain.

I saw him in the hall and tried to ask him to book me,but this crazy new patient lady jumped in front of me and completely blocked the dr.  She told me the dr was busy...when the dr actually smiled at me and took 2 steps toward me by the left counter.  The dr looked so embarrassed that this sraff lady did this:  both arms sticking out like a basketball player!
I have xrays,ct,mri that show all my injuries and even diagnosed at san fran genetic hospital!   The bloodwork is full proof as well!  There was an actual review here that said to go ask the dr directly for an appointment and dont even deal with new patient lady!
So it was clear that this office lady was aware people were told NOT TO DEAL WITH HER!
This was in 2020...
This office lady is NOT A LICENSED DR!!!
SHE HAS NO TRAINING OR STATE LICENSE TO DIAGNOSE OR REJECT PATIENTS!  THAT IS NOT HER JOB!!!
SHE HAS NOT BE TRAINED NOR STATE BOARD CERTIFIED TO DIAGNOSE OR REJECT PATIENTS WITH PAYING INSURANCE AND TESTS!!
I WAS GOING TO SAC STATE FOR LICENSED DERMATOLOGIST MD!!!
I KNOW THE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA!   IVE HAD MEETINGS WITH THEM!
THIS OFFICE LADY IS OPERATING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF HER PRACTICE/ LICENSE...
ILL BE RECORDING HER NX TIME FOR PROSECUTION.   THIS CANT GO ON....|Stay away from this place this is just a money, Mill, and a pill mill. They cancel and reschedule your appointment for the same thing numerous time over just so they could charge insurance company.
Two nurse practitioners there seem to be extremely unprofessional and only focus on generating money and not taking care of people just by the way to cancel and reschedule the same appointment over and over. On two occasions I was there right by the exit door I've seen cockroaches on the ground. Stay away from this place.|I have not only back issue but other issues I am waiting to see specialist for.
My primary and gastro specialist also are within a group who do not prescribe pain meds. I was sent to another pain place in manyeca and they do not prescribe pain meds. I was finally refered to pain management. I went in with medication in my system. Told the doctor this before I ever tested very first appointment. I could see if I was under contract with them. But no I was red flagged and told there's nothing they can do. My husband works 6sm to 3:30 pm it's not feasible to go to the er every few days to get pain medication. Not only that if you are going there every few days than you will be labeled drug seeking. I am not going to give up the friend who helped me overcome pain management while I was trying to get the referals and appointments. I'm not saying that's the right way. But when a  person is trying to do the right thing and get there own script so they can do it the right way and be turned down it's wrong. If I had signed a contract with you and than showed up with something else not mine in my system than absolutely cut me off. But it was very first appointment and no contracts had been signed.  I'm being sent to specialists for a current situation. It's not just the back problems. Which ate severe enough themselves. . I had been on pain medication many years but my primary fired me for no related issue. I was left reeling and finding a doctor to deal with pain meds is very hard. You have to go to appointments and if you do not care for that new doctor you have to wait a month to see the next new doctor. You find one you like he has to refer to get images to get you to pain clinic this all takes months. I'm sorry I could not handle the pain. And someone helped me. That person should not be punished for showing human kindness. I should not be punished not being under contract. On my very first appointment.|I did my consultation and we decided on a treatment but there was a problem with insurance approval. After sorting out the insurance issue I called and left 8 messages with the referral department over the course of two months but never got an answer or a call back. Two months after that I had given up and was already seeing a different doctor when I got a call saying they had to reschedule the appointment for my treatment due to scheduling issues. Not only was I never informed of this appointment in the first place but that was three weeks ago and I still haven't heard anything about the new appointment.|I see the Dr's or their staff every 3 months and have been very pleased. They are always very friendly and helpful.  Sometimes the wait is a little longer than others, but always within reason.  At the same time I never feel rushed through my visit, as I have with other Dr's I have seen, which have been many over the years.  Thank you for your caring.|I have been a patient there for many years now, i pay cash, and  yesterday at my appointment i was told that they will not schedule my next appointment until my balance of 75 dollars is paid. How sad is that during a pandemic,  as hard as it is to make money because my husband works for the schools that are shut down, so moneys been tight....  and my doctor  is refusing to see me until i pay my account off... i have always made my payments,  and i have been with them for so long to be treated like this very sad... this is a very heartless facility...  i thought it was harsh that within a year period their prices went from 50$ to 75, then to 150, and thats if you only see the assistant.... 200 if you see the Dr... but refusing care during a pandemic is even lower!!! Lets not forget their mandatory drug tests cost 225 each.... the only reason i have a balance was because they raised the price on the drug tests, and gave me 4 tests back to back..... so i don't recommend this facility any longer",2024-10-06|2025-02-06|2024-01-15|2023-06-06|2023-04-10|2023-02-14|2020-01-06|2020-07-21,5|5|1|1|1|1|5|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",74.5|73.25|62.75,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What are the time they pick up the phone.","We answer phone calls from 8:00 AM-4:30 PM MON-THURS and 8:00 AM-2:15 PM on FRI",emergency_appointments|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJeRV4TcVWkIARlU4MWxRwliE,62

Getting TO the provider was also challenging I almost gave up. More on that below. The provider was on time, thorough, and caring. Again, 5* on my appointment.
I am a new patient.  I called and left several messages and received no callbacks. I called again and someone answered (yay). I was asked to fill out online forms before I could have an appointment  I filled out the forms and waited almost a week, then called back and left a message.I called AGAIN, and the person who answered said she couldn't see the forms. She gave excuses for not calling me back. I asked for a supervisor and she put me on a long hold. She came back to the call and said she found the forms. No apology about any of the lack of response from them. The good news is that there was an opening soon and I got an appointment (yay). Overall, very poor assistance. It's important that the front desk is prompt and responsive, especially with a provider for pain and psychiatric services!|Check-in process was swift ON-TIME and professional.

Lobby & office space were very nice as well. Dr. Ananth spent time listing to my concerns and gave me plenty of time during my visit. Super hopeful !|Visited office on urgent status for my chronic osteoarthritis condition which was reviewed, treated, given medication for, and was given referrals immediately for treatment. My attending physician was very thorough and attentive to my needs, a real comfort.|Check in process was great, all done on iPad. The office staff and medical assistant were very helpful and knowledgeable. Dr Ananth took the time to go over everything and to help ease my fears/concerns.|My regular therapist requested I seek a psychiatric evaluation for some challenges I'm experiencing. My insurance listed this office. They were very insistent that I would not be able to see the psychiatrist first. The front office was nice, the psych nurse who did my intake was kind but not thorough in that she kept mixing up my information and appeared to write notes inside of her planner. She did share with me that she was very concerned about my problems and would speak to the psychiatrist, so I felt hopeful about things.

She called me late that evening to state the psychiatrist, who did not meet with me, request any records, or consult with my regular therapist, says I'm stressed. I agree. Part of that is because I am not receiving the care I am requesting. So... the search for a psychiatric provider continues and although other reviews here state he's fantastic with physical health, I cannot attest to any confidence in his ability to provide mental health support.|Very warm and inviting atmosphere!

In fact, today is the second time in the last 5 weeks he's done this for me. He is the best doctor I've ever had. I can't believe how lucky I was to meet him and for him to take me on as a new patient 5 years ago. And I'm not talking about him giving me pain meds or opioids! He's not that kind of doctor so don't ask.

I am a very unique migraine case-maybe 5% of what works for everyone else works for me. He's tried so many things for me and they're finally under control day-to-day. If you're looking for an amazing pain medicine doctor, Dr. Richard Shinaman at PMC is your guy! He's honestly the best doctor I've ever had. Cares about EVERYTHING going on with me not just the pain. He's been so open to trying new things on me and I'm just so thankful he takes my pain seriously. He didn't quit on me when the first 2, 3 hell, 10 things didn't work like ALL of my prior doctors. He genuinely cares and tell me the last time you could say this about ANY of your doctors.

My husband was in crippling pain and had not slept in days. He did not rush through the appointment, if anything, he took his time, reviewed the xrays and even consulted with my husband's primary physician. He gave helpful therapeutic and medicinal suggestions, and did not give up until he made sure my husband normalized and could lead a pain-free life again.

I have neck and upper spine pain as well as an autoimmune disease. Fortunately I was referred to Dr. Samimi by a top rheumatologist several years ago. I appreciate that Dr. Samimi believes and understands what I'm going through, from the first time I met with him. He has come up with pain treatment plans that have been more effective than just taking strong pain meds by themselves, and helped me go off the meds I didn't like.

Dr. Samimi has always been there for me when I've needed him, whether it's answering emails between appointments, calling in refills, and countless other things. He always does his best to work with our insurance to find the best treatment available that can be covered. He always takes his time to listen to me even when I have a lot to go over. He has excellent bedside manners and compassion.

The other doctors that work at the practice are also great. I'd feel confident using any of them.|Wonderful office. Responsive. Average wait time. Never feel rushed.

I've been a patient for years and had 5 surgeries with them. In the last several months they have dramatically changed their policies to block patients from getting care in any sort of reasonable timeframe, leaving them in pain for an unethical amount of time. Today I was informed that all Botox services would cease after I've spent weeks trying to get my routine treatment and jumping through countless hoops for them. They have no plan, no referrals, no support for patients that have been having this pain service with them for years. I can't fathom how they think this is the way to treat patients.|Worst office experience. If you don't care if you personal information is yelled across the lobby, ok. Or that the scheduling staff cancels appointments without letting you know, please this may be your place. I let the staff know this was not ok with me. Oh, and they had another patient getting mad cuz he had to wait. He got so mad, after he growled at me that it was my fault (ha!) try blaming the appropriate people dude! Plus he was using curse words. Did the staff do anything?  Nope. So go here is you are a Masochist.  This is my story and my opinion.|I was refered by my doctor to this place and I go make an appointment the pa saw me and said they would approve my Botox treatment and to wait for the insurance to approve it. They said it takes 7-10 business days for it to be approved. I call them after two weeks since I did not hear from them.

They told me it was still pending with my insurance.

I call the insurance company and they said there was not even a pending authorization.

I call them back and they said someone would call me back and they never did. I repeat call backs and I go to there office and it was closed during normal business hours.

Finally someone says they will call me back. Someone did call me and and I missed there call. They said they no longer go through insurance for Botox even though they advertise it on there website.

They said they can send it off for a prescription or something to that effect on the voice mail they left me.

I have called the main office and there authorization department at least six times at each line and no one will call me back.

I have never had such poor customer service from a doctor's office.

No one has since called me back. If they would have just called me back and let me know they don't provide that service that would have been fine. But they can't even do that.

Mind you I am in pain waiting for them to reply.

If you want terrible customer service and for them to never call you back go see them. The worst doctors office I've ever been to. If I could give zero stars I would.|1st appt went well, got in to see a PA who was great. She wanted more time to go over my complex case, and made an appt with me for today.

Yesterday I got a call from a woman at the clinic who told me I needed to show up 15 min early today to fill out their new intake. I said ""As long as it isn't Phreesia."" She replied it was. I told her I don't sign away my medical info to 3rd parties who resell it.

She then cancelled my appt for today. Either I allow my data to be sold, or I cannot get pain management. I asked to speak to the mgr and even called back an hour later, never got a return call.

Shame, I really thought this was a service of compassionate providers. Instead it is gatekeepers who must be getting a cut from Phreesia for giving up patient data.

Ironically my Allergist is next door, they have had Phreesia 2 years but appropriately opted me out when I asked.

TLDR: Providers seem great, staff is anything but.
*********
After going into the office and asking for a manager callback (I am seen at a provider in the same building who has opted me out of Phreesia for 2 years) I got one the following day.

The manager does not believe me that Phreesia sells medical data to pharmaceutical companies for targeted advertising. It is openly on their website.

She refused to allow me to have any follow-up care in this clinic simply because I need to protect my PHI. There was no exception made, no matter how I offered to do the paperwork.

As a disabled veteran, my PHI is tied to my income. Access to one means access to benefits info. I cannot risk that. Not even for much needed pain management.

When you begin to question the ethics of a pain management clinic, you wonder where else they fall short in their ethics and business practices.
Reduced to 1 star because it won't let me do 0.|Zero stars.
I had an appointment for 8:00 a.m. The receptionist who made the appointment, Miguel, called me the day before to confirm and instructed me to arrive at 7:45 a.m. to fill out paperwork which I did. At 8:30 I asked him if he knew how much longer it would be because I had another appointment. He told me my appointment wasn't until 9:00.
I let him know he had called to confirm my 8:00 appointment with me the day before and had asked me to arrive at 7:45 to fill out paperwork.
He then said sorry, I was wondering why you were here so early for your appointment.
I then told him again, my appointment was at 8:00 and he had confirmed that fact with me yesterday. He did not attempt to have me seen, he just said sorry again.
Don't waste your time with this office.|First off the location is not the best for those who have severe pain and difficulty walking. Arrived for my appointment 15 minutes early as requested so I could fill out paperwork. Arrived and there wasn't a person in sight other than another patient waiting.  While waiting for someone to show up and help me another person walked in. And then another. Finally someone was at the receptionist desk and I started walking up and he rudely said he was just looking something up. He then proceeded to check in the 3rd person that walked in, then took the second person to the back after checking her in. I then get called back by a doctor, I think his name started with an H, who then proceeds to talk to me about my situation while firmly stating he would not allow me any pain meds (I have severe pain and nothing has helped aside from pain medication) . I scoffed at him after realizing this guy doesn't want to help me with my pain, he simply wants to inject me or do an epidural, even though when all was said and done, he told me he wasn't sure their kind of treatment would work for me since he is doubting my diagnosis. He was knowledgeable, but definitely looking out for his pocket instead his patients. Then AFTER this consultation He had me do vitals my blood pressure was high, but I was in extreme pain. The person who did my vitals had no idea how to pronounce any of my medications. Vitals took almost 15 minutes. Anyway, this is not the place for me. Unfriendly and incompetent staff, dirty and extremely cold waiting room. Would not recommend if you have serious pain issues.|I've been going to Dr Mozingo (Pacific Pain)for over 20 years. He has the best diagnostic skills. The other Drs are very skilled , attentive to your health care. Well being is there goal for their patients.
I'd highly recommend any of the practicing Pain therapist.|Dr. Roshan was excellent! He did a great job explaining the procedure we are considering including the pros and cons.

**Tina** at the front desk deserves special recognition. Her professionalism and warm demeanor immediately put me at ease during what can often be a stressful experience. She was efficient in handling paperwork and made sure I was well-informed about my wait time, which was surprisingly short.

The medical staff at CRPM Medical are equally commendable. They provided thorough explanations of procedures, listened attentively to my concerns, and treated me with the utmost respect and care. The facility itself is clean, modern, and well-organized, which adds to the overall comfort of the visit.

What stood out to me was not just the medical treatment but the genuine compassion shown by everyone especially  PA-C Manuel. The front desk to the medical team. It's clear that CRPM Medical values patient care deeply.

I understand that however my past doctors would do Urine test , labs and prescriptions all on the same visit and if there was an issue with your urine this would be addressed on your follow up appointment. The pain clinic wanted me to wait another two weeks for another appointment. My primary requested the urine results. After 20 minutes my primary comes back in the room and says "" There's no issues "" with the urine and I'll be writing a bridge script  for you and he did . Just be careful with them because if there is ever any issues they will just ignore you and then wonder why you leave . I have my original pain management back .

He is always about keeping you pain free healthy.|I think I have been treated by JZ and Dr. Doraiswamy for about 10 years. Everyone in the office are courteous and very helpful.

I originally saw Dr. Doraiswamy and was switched over Jz a few years ago. I love all of the staff.

I believe a lot of the bad reviews on here are due to people doing drugs illegally and they get caught when drug tested. Just something to keep in mind when reading these reviews.|This pain clinic is the best so far i have ever been. They are professional, polite, kind and curtious. They go the extra mile when handling their job duties. Dr Anylou is one of the best at her job. She builds a kind relationship with her patients and makes you can't wait to revisit again because her and her staff Bertha,Denise, and Kathy makes you feel like family. Im confident in her decisions. I thank the entire staff for being such wonderful people.|I have been going to the pain clinic for 4 years and have only had great results.

For almost 10 years now and have had at least 100 different procedures and have always respected the care and professionalism from the entire staff to Dr KY himself have gone above and beyond the normal expected from a doctor and their entire staff.|When I came to Dr. Paul Ky I was in a wheelchair I was frightened for anybody to get near my left arm and I wouldn't let nobody touch me. Dr.Ky begin to treat me with his injections I was not even able to stand up past two minutes I now am out of the wheelchair using a walker and since then I had a stimulator thank you Dr. Paul Ky for giving me back my life.|I have severe neck issues in constant pain !!!! I have never went into a Drs office with a pain level 9-10 .... and left with no pain ? This Dr Paul Ky, was the most down to earth Dr I have ever meet he explained my diagnosis in words I could understand! He gave me Great advice and Opinions ! I am so Grateful to be 1 of his patients!!!!! I don't plan on going anywhere! I highly recommend
Dr.Paul Ky, DO.|My first visit with the PA I was very impressed and also with Doctor once I met him for the first time. They were very thorough and asking their questions about where the pain was how it felt and their goal was to find the root of the problem of the pain. Tests were ordered. It took a couple months. We found what the problem was and referrals were done to the doctors that can help. Unfortunately
it requires surgery. And that aspect I give them a 10 They are great! The only problem I have was every single month I had a problem getting my prescriptions to help with the pain I was constantly calling in every month and requesting with the pharmacy to call in the script to get my prescription. I'm hoping soon that this will be resolved. Of course when I left a message I always asked him to recurring my call and update me on the status I never got a call back. Other than getting my prescriptions timely,  I love the doctors. I'm so glad that my general doctor referred me to them.|Dr. KY is the best at what he does.  Very knowledgeable and explains everything very clearly.   The front office can be rude at times and unprofessional.  The gossiping and standing around while patients are waiting to be helped at the front window.   I had asked a question about the co-payment that had not been asked for before.  It was like talking to a dear in headlights.  They had no clue and did not offer to ask billing about it.  At that time it came up that I had been accumulating charges for one full year.  Not once did I receive a bill nor was it brought to my attention until I had asked about the co-payment.  It's ashame Dr. KY does not have a front office staff equivalent to his knowledge and understanding.|I have been going to Advanced Pain Solutions for well over 10 year's. Dr.Ky still cares about my pain and doesn't give up on me! The staff is incredibly sweet and get things done! It has to be so hard always listening to patients complain all day. The staff never makes you feel like you're a burden!  Thanks guys!|Very nice man and spent an inordinate amount of time testing and documenting every flexible joint in my body. It was really bad news. But he only injected my R rotator cuff with something to dull the pain there. Which it did for all of three days when it was supposed to be effective until my next appointment!  I've had similar injections in my lumbar region that resulted in similar results. Two days numbing of pain. By fifth day , back to same pain. Next to worthless. I won't do it again.|Great job !!

While you see the employee talking laughing casually while you're frustrated in an overly pack waiting room.|Amazing doctor without him I wouldn't have known I needed surgery.
Thank you, Dr. Salazar.|I was seen on 5/6/24 as a new patient on a referral from my primary care physician because I have been experiencing severe lower back pain. Upon arrival I noticed that the doctors office stays fairly full. All my registration papery was done online for an 8:45 appointment I was called back to the room at 9:30. No heart rate taken, no blood pressure taken and no weight taken. The amount of patients in and out and only seeing doctor Salazar it seems as if he really didn't spend much time with the patients which was a concern for me as I have multiple health issues and a team of doctors at Stanford. As I waited in the room I was so optimistic that I was going to be on the road to pain relief and better mobility to enjoy my family and outdoor activities. Dr. Salazar entered the room introduced himself and pulled up my pain chart in which I had circled my areas of pain. He then asked what kind of work do I do, I explained I'm disabled and worked up until 2015 due to a brain injury in 2013. He asked while working what kind of work did I do and I began to explain to him the work I did involved lots of heavy lifting. I then started to give him information about my back telling him that while employed I had an incident where I had a spasm in my back while at work was taken to hospital by ambulance given muscle relaxer by IV and back to work in 2 days. I had X-ray and all necessary treatments to determine if there was anything else wrong and there was not. At this point doctor Salazar stopped me and said he can't see me until I bring a release of my settlement which I tried to explain to him there was no case, no settlement, no fury treatment needed because I had a muscle spasm. He no longer wanted to hear about my medical as it pertains to my visit all he said was if he's supposed to be paid by workers comp and he's paid by my insurance at this point he said he can't see me until I bring a worker's comp release. I have no release there was no case and I was referred by my primary care and this was not a comp claim. As I sat there trying to explain he shut the computer down closed my file and said follow me, I'm still sitting there in shock because I've never been treated this way he then turned around and said louder follow me and walked me out! I'm still in disbelief and when I got to my car I called my husband and cried! He was not at all interested in my medical history or anything else. It was clear he wanted nothing to do with me other than getting me in and out. He doesn't have time for a new patient as he doesn't have the time to spend with the patient. At the front desk I explained to the receptionist I'm not sure what just happened and I immediately contacted my primary care physician. I prayed about what happened to me yesterday and was going to just move on but I received an email survey from doctor Salazar's office this morning. I decided to open it and complete the survey which was questions and answers only ( agree, disagree, etc) once I completed the survey I was hoping to find an area to elaborate on my experience but there was not! So that's why I decided to leave a review. If you are a new patient with multiple health issues like myself, I have heart issues, blood pressure issues as well as autonomic issues that I will deal with for the rest of my life from a brain injury. With that being said my health care team has to have time to properly communicate with me as well as time to communicate with my physicians at Stanford as this is critical in my healthcare and doctor Salazar clearly doesn't have the time for that. I am thankful for this platform to put my experience out there as I have learned that I have to be proactive in my healthcare.|Dr Salazar has been my pain management physician since 1998. Over the years he has treated me I have NO complaints. His has an outstanding staff who are attentive to the patients needs. Dr is always up on the state of the art ways to treat his patients. I highly recommend Dr to my family, friends and anyone who will listen. Often while waiting, which is never long, the patients will talk to each other about the treatments they are receiving. It is wonderful to have a group chat with people who understand and have pain as an issue in their life. To top it off there is always candy on your way out.|I get my pain pump refilled here every month. I love these doctors and their staff. Each and every one in the office is pleasant to work with. I've been coming here over 5 years and have received excellent care every time I've had an appointment. I really appreciate their continued social distancing and mask  wearing and enforcement of the same for all of their staff and patients. I really like having all services available to me at one place... billing, labs, surgical services, and regular appointments. I couldn't ask for a better place to receive my regular care.|I have been a patient of the center starting 1999 when Dr Kalamakarian was the Dr formerly called San Juaquin valley pain management center with PA Mr. . Mr Johncox is excellent with a relaxed great bedside manner he always listens to my level of pain and where it stems from. He is knowledgeable professional and easy to talk to thank you!  I have seen him also close to 22 years. Dr Salazar took over and he is a great doctor with a funny relaxing manner and has done many epidural injections that were successful along with monthly pain pump refills. I trust them all 100%. Their entire staff the medical assistants are always friendly and I enjoy seeing them for my monthly visits. The entire office staff is very professional and friendly I would never go anywhere else for my chronic spinal pain treatment.|The staff and doctors at Dr. Salazar's office have always shown me much respect and care!! They have shown the utmost in professionalism and excellent medical care!!  I have had the privilege of being a patient at Dr. Salazar's advanced pain management team for eight-plus years. My comfort and needs from my monthly appointments to my medical care have always shown to be their number one concern.|My name is m.j iqbal, i was a pt.with dr. Salazar for several years.  He cares for his patients.   He tries his best to see that his patients are pain free by prescribing the right meds, injections and physical therapy.  His staff is very courteous and helpful.

-After X-rays of

-spine
Just could not figure it out!
So treatment of anesthesia and shots of a  dont remember drug, then the prescription of Vicodin.
All better now. NOT!
Its the Mayo clinic they are the best, really punched up my Blue Cross PPO, and co-pay. Cha-ching$$$$$
Moving forward - 2 years later in Arizona,lots of booze, vicodin, excruciating PAIN, Headaches, nausea, call ambulance.
No a US Marine does not,( I drive) to the Phoenix,AZ Veterans Hospital which the media talked crap about!
Pain killers waiting at the ER Door. X-ray neck (and MRI from outsourced Mayo$$$)
ER Doctor shows me Xray and says see that little itty bitty piece of shrapnel or something in your spine/neck? Is hitting the main nerve on your Left side, creating, all the above problems.
An ER Doctor from the supposed shitty VA Hospital figured it out in 10 minutes!
So no the Mayo clinic (TREATS) NOT CURES SHIT!
This is why there is a line out the door every 1st of the month for pain meds at MAYO!
Kudos to the VA Hospital, and to the Navy Neuro Surgeon, informed me yes surgery can fix , but may never walk again, Honesty!
So do I  recommend the MAYO, No !|Absolutely the best Dr. and Staff from the front office to the Nurses, They are very awsome.|Love Dr. Grewel and his staff. They're so kind and supportive.

The staff members were nice as well.|Honestly it too soon to give a proper rating. Just had my procedure done yesterday.  I was in and out quickly and the staff was very nice.

They got a fast approval from my provider and I was in that week. That in it self is great. When your in pain getting treated quickly is needed and appreciated.

Now just hoping this will elevate my pain and discomfort.

Thank you Advanced|I was treated very well by Doctors and staff members. This facility is always neat and clean, the environment is very good!

He and his team gave me my life back!

Dr. Prager listened to me and directly, empathetically, and confidently, explained a clear plan. He gave me hope!  Dr. Prager with his team, and Kelly, his knowledgeable and patient Nurse Practitioner, set about getting my pain under control. They never let me go. Dr. Prager and his team are truely outstanding in the field of pain management.|I've been a patient of the California Pain Medicine Center for almost 25 years. From the doctors to the nurse practitioners and front office, they all deserve five stars. Dr. Prager and Dr. Barnard are caring physicians on the cutting edge of new research and treatments. Erica Jenkins, the nurse practitioner, deserves ten stars. She goes out of her way to provide every patient with the very best care and treatment. She listens! The front office, (especially Andrew and Itxayana) deserve a special shout out for all their organization of appointments and procedures. Trust me when I say they fight insurance companies for the procedures patients need. I am blessed to have this entire team in my corner.|Note: It has been 10 YEARS (!!!) since I wrote this review! Dr Prager is still my pain doctor and has never failed his promise to take care of my pain ....  so I could have a better life

Dr. Prager opened his new practice, California Pain Medicine, in Santa Monica several years ago and we followed him there

As far as I'm concerned, no other pain doctor comes close to Dr. Prager. You can look up his impressive credentials, his education, professional alliances, his medical and surgical experience. I will relate my personal experience.

When I first saw Dr. Prager, I was laying in a reclining wheelchair, shaking in pain. I had a heating pad on my abdomen and ice packs all around my pelvis. I have a severe form of interstitial cystitis (which destroys the lining of the bladder) and pudendal neuralgia, for which there is no cure and no effective treatment. I had been ill for over 15 years, gradually declining until I was bedridden for the last three years. I could not walk, sit, or even stand. The pain was relentless, day and night, and I was at the end of my rope.

However, as Dr. Prager started talking, I began to feel a glimmer of hope. He really seemed to understand the kind of pain I was in, and my confidence grew as he outlined a plan that would possibly give me back my life. Out of all the doctors and specialists, and after all the failed treatments and surgeries -- Dr. Prager was the one who finally helped me.

It has been more than two years since I had the surgery that gave me back my life. In November of 2012, Dr. Prager implanted an intrathecal pain pump into my abdomen. It contains a mixture of three medications which drip slowly into my spinal fluid and, to put it simply, anesthetize (deaden) the pain signals. We knew it would work because a trial with the same medications a month earlier had been an astounding success. I remember SITTING without pain for the first time in 4-5 years, and WALKING, by myself, around the nurses station at least 7 times!

Today I am walking, laughing, and enjoying life. I can go places, eat at restaurants, see the latest movies. My husband and my sister, who were there during the darkest hours, cry tears of joy when they see me happy and doing things. My husband has  been known to get misty-eyed simply from coming home from work and finding me in the kitchen cooking dinner.|I have been in pain management for over 12 years due to a chronic long term illness. I saw the same great pain management practice since diagnosis. I moved to CA in February. I reached out to California Pain Medicine Center and Dr Gabriel Barnard even before I moved so, I  would have no lapse in care. Dr Barnard has been so great in continuing my care with much empathy, passion and understanding. His office staff have also been extremely nice and helpful, and they answer the phone and get back to me quickly anytime I need something. I 100% + recommend California Pain Medicine Center for anyone needing excellent care.|Dr Barnard is great.   He is very attentive and thorough.    I didn't feel rushed which I really appreciated.  Fingers crossed that I can finally get relief from the pain.|This review is very long overdue. I should have written this a while ago. Dr. Prager, nurse practitioner Erica Jenkins, Dr. Barnard and their team are the best in their field. I have been to my fair share of pain management doctors over the years. Dr. Prager and Erica, by far, provide the best and most thorough care to the point where they supersede expectations. They truly listen, ask questions, and take their time. They never finish an appointment if there are any remaining questions or concerns. They have improved my quality of life beyond what I had achieved with other practitioners. I wish Erica was my primary provider. She deserves gold stars for everything she does. They are all a wealth of knowledge and so caring. It has been an honor and pleasure to be under their care. It has been a true blessing.
I've had consults and a procedure with Dr. Barnard. He and his team were also equally great. If I need another procedure, I would only want Dr. Barnard from here on.
The office staff are also so nice, patient, friendly, and efficient.
I wholeheartedly recommend this practice. They are amazing.|Went to UCLA Med Center where Dr Gabriel Barnard treated my torn left shoulder with a temporary electronic implant to see if it helps the pain.  Hopefully it will work and a permanent implant can be used.  I will update the status of yesterday's procedure when I follow up with Dr B next Friday.

I have great confidence in the skill and judgment of Dr Barnard and his staff as I have been treated like the most important person in the world and cared for with a very high level of competence and compassion.

I am hopeful that I get relief from severe pain and I very much appreciate Dr Barnard's honest assessment of my issues telling me the procedure should provide relief but realistically it probably won't be 100% pain free.

I am very grateful for this procedure being tested on me since my condition does not allow for surgical repair of the torn shoulder.

I am happy to answer any questions regarding the procedure and my treatment under Dr Barnard.  Just know that I would not have this procedure performed by anyone other than Dr Barnard.

Sincerely

Michael Rosenthal
Woodland Hills CA
July 8, 2023|Dr Barnard is an empathetic and knowledgeable doctor who really listens to the patient. I'm currently receiving stellate ganglion block injections to treat CRPS. I've had 4 injections so far over the course of 2 months, and they have gradually been reducing the inflammation and pain in my wrist and hand. It's important to communicate clearly to the doctor so that he can adjust his course of treatment accordingly. CRPS is tricky to treat and before each injection Dr Barnard checks in with me to discuss how things are progressing and then determines his next course of action. During each procedure, Dr Barnard describes exactly what he is going to do step by step. He adjusts the amount of medication according to what he determines will be most effective. I feel very well cared for and reassured that I will recover from CRPS.",2025-01-08|2024-08-02|2024-09-20|2024-06-14|2024-09-20|2023-11-27|2023-07-09|2023-11-17,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJAQDwKIS8woARO-o7PqTy-Ss,54

I would recommend Dr Malek to any of my friends and family if they ever needed pain management care. I was blessed to have found him!|My experience here has been lovely, staff has been very friendly and helpful. Doctor Malek is personable and caring, you can tell he cares a lot about his patients. I had one treatment and now I feel so much better now! I like the fact that doctor malek doesn't just evaluate you for one problem, he goes further into an deep evaluation and takes his time with you to tell you every information needed. Thank you Dr. Malek for the time and care! I will recommend you to others.|Dr Malek is excellent with all the procedures that Ive had with him. From the beginning I was limping and in pain, now i am not limping and with little to no pain! The doctor and staff are fantastic. The progress with this doctor and amazing and he cares about me.

He took his time with me and helped me to understand what was going on with my body. The staff then scheduled an appointment for me to come in for a pain management treatment. The appointment/treatment went so well that three and a half weeks later I virtually have no more pain. He is a miracle worker as far as I am concerned. I want anyone out there that is experiencing any sort of pain and distress should schedule an appointment with Dr. Malek and ascertain what he could do for you. I am totally sure that you won't be sorry. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I highly recommend Dr Cheng and his team.|Everyone is very nice and professional. I've been seeing Elizabeth for several years now. Dr Cheng is such a caring physician and I have to mention the team that does the injections and surgeries there, Hanna, Erika are all Amazing I highly recommend them all.|Dr Cheng's group at Elite Pain Management is awesome. I was referred to them by my Primary MD for neck pain. Instead of just assuming I had arthritis and putting me on yet more pain meds or other treatments, I was sent for an MRI. Dr Cheng personally called me as soon as he got the results letting me know that I had a large mass on my cervical spine. He spoke to me with care and compassion and referred me immediately to a wonderful Neurosurgeon and I had the mass removed ASAP. Thankfully my come has been very good! Dr Cheng always called back when I had questions and always made me feel cared about. Thank so much to Dr  Cheng and your wonderful staff!|Everyone was very cordial. My procedure was explained to me very well. It was difficult to get an appointment.|It's a very bad clinic. The front desk can't make an appointment for patients. It takes nearly two months to wait for the doctor's reply. Please stay away from this clinic.|I called to schedule an appointment so I could get some trigger point injections and it was definitely a different experience; they took my info including my insurance details and said they would call me back within the next few days after reviewing to let me know if they would accept me as a new patient... it was a bit odd that I couldn't schedule a consultation and I wasn't asked what I wanted to be seen for.

I will post back after hearing from them so readers can see the result of my experience.  Definitely a first for me with not being asked any qualifying questions.

The gal that I spoke to on the phone couldn't tell me what she meant by ""the doctor needs to review before scheduling an appointment""

Either way, I hope I at least get the question of what I'm looking to have done and what sort of treatments I need whether it be injections, medications, multi-modality, etc.|I had a terrible accident years ago that left me with chronic back pain, among other things. My back surgeon recommended Dr. Cheng at Elite Pain Management and it was the best thing that could have happened to me.

First, everyone in that office is wonderful. They truly care about my injury, about my life and they do everything they can to make sure I can live as normal and pain-free a life as possible.
Also, I have procedures on my back a couple of times a year. I just had one 6 days ago and I am already so much better. These procedures are not easy to say the least. Due to a brain injury that I sustained during the same accident that damaged my back, I am practically immune to sedation. Only general anesthesia works on me. Which means that during these procedures, I am fully awake and aware. The doctors here know this and they remember. Each time I have to have this done, they do everything in their power to make sure I am comfortable. They'll have conversations with me about my family, movies, things I've bought on Amazon. Whatever it takes to distract me. They are fast and incredibly efficient. And most importantly they are incredibly kind. I can't recommend them enough or be more grateful for all they do.|Everyone here at Elite Pain Management is superior to any other pain specialist I have seen.

His calm demeanor was welcoming after being seen by another doctor who was mean and didn't seem to care much if at all.
My insurance changed in the middle of obtaining the treatment that was needed.
After an almost three year break in treatment I started to decline.
I changed insurance carriers and was referred to Dr. Loomba once again.
After two months, I can honestly say I feel better. It's because of the treatment, injections and meds, but also the fact that I'm being seen by a provider who cares.
His staff is great as well.|They all treated me with such respect and explained everything as my procedure was being performed. My doctor was very accurate, informative, and attentive to all of my questions and concerns. I would 100% recommend this office to everyone, thank you again! I've waited almost a year for some pain relief, and kept getting the runaround everywhere else until I got to this wonderful office!|Dr. Loomba Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly admirable. Always goes above and beyond to ensure his patients receive the best care possible. Thank you|Dr. Loomba is a compssionate and caring Dr. The staff is very friendly and also caring to your concerns.

Lumba's care.
He took the time to come up with a plan for my care which is exactly what I have been looking for in a dr..
I thought I knew what my care should be and through his experience he took control of the situation and satisfied my need for actual health care.
Thank you Dr. Lumba|Dr. Loomba was very helpful at our intake appointment. He explained to me what was causing my hip/knee pain. We made a treatment plan. I'm hoping for less pain and a better night's sleep. I also want to keep up my exercise routine.|After many many years of trying to seek treatment elsewhere, I finally found a doctor and staff that are trying to help me with my chronic pain. Everyone here listens to my concerns and are helping me feel better.
Thank you|I would give zero stars if I could. This man does not listen or let me speak. He hasn't spoken to a single doctor of mine in the 9 months he's been treating me. My other physicians say they have reached out with no response. I believe them because they've done it in front of me and once I leave the building, I can't get ahold of anyone in the office either. Plus they kept me alive while I was a dying quadriplegic, so I trust them. Last week, he yelled at me in front of a resident and said, I don't care about your doctors appointment with your Neurologist. You can just find another pain management doctor. I have it recorded. It's crazy and that's it exactly, he just doesn't care. If it was one of his family members, I guarantee he would have made time to do his job. I have so much more but what's the point. My body is literally eating itself from the inside so I have to go through all of the hassle with insurance to start all over.

She said ""no it's ok ill find it"" so she puts the needle in and keeps poking me. Trying to find the vein. She said ""there it is."" As I go in to the room I  take my shirt off lay face down on the table. The nurse picks up my arm and proceeds to administer the sedation. As she pushed in the sedation it didn't go into my veins it stayed between the skin and the vein on my forearm creating an instant searing sensation. I was screaming in pain crying after and after a few minutes they realized to put sailine to try to stop the pain. 2 minutes later they wheel me out and don't tell my fiance anything about what happened she was confused and didn't understand why I was in pain.

I've been calling them trying to figure out how they're going to make my arm feel Normal again they hang up on me and ignore me. Cops can't do anything.

I am a 37 year old female with two kids, a chronic medical condition, and have adverse side effects from prior medication I was on.

I was amazed at how thorough they were in conducting a proper interview in determining my root pain. They have done test and have been managing my pain with approved medical methods. All the doctors are amazing in helping their patients in getting pain relief and getting to the root of the problem, which I appreciate so much. I just started here and I already know that with ongoing maintenance I am going to be feeling a whole lot better with the medical issues I have.

Never had a bad experience...
They call you back same day!!!!|I had a referal and medical records for my genetic issues since 2001 showing all treatments and drs and every report...the new patient office lady never called me.  I came into the office to be told she was on vacation!   So for a week nobody handled her stuff!  I finally came in and got to talk to her.  She said:   my records were not written clearly enough for her to even read, which i brought in disc form typed but she never even looked at either!  She wouldn't let me even see the main male dr that everyone said was compassionate.   I saw him in the hall and tried to ask him to book me,but this crazy new patient lady jumped in front of me and completely blocked the dr.  She told me the dr was busy...when the dr actually smiled at me and took 2 steps toward me by the left counter.  The dr looked so embarrassed that this sraff lady did this:  both arms sticking out like a basketball player!
I have xrays,ct,mri that show all my injuries and even diagnosed at san fran genetic hospital!   The bloodwork is full proof as well!  There was an actual review here that said to go ask the dr directly for an appointment and dont even deal with new patient lady!
So it was clear that this office lady was aware people were told NOT TO DEAL WITH HER!
This was in 2020...
This office lady is NOT A LICENSED DR!!!
SHE HAS NO TRAINING OR STATE LICENSE TO DIAGNOSE OR REJECT PATIENTS!  THAT IS NOT HER JOB!!!
SHE HAS NOT BE TRAINED NOR STATE BOARD CERTIFIED TO DIAGNOSE OR REJECT PATIENTS WITH PAYING INSURANCE AND TESTS!!
I WAS GOING TO SAC STATE FOR LICENSED DERMATOLOGIST MD!!!
I KNOW THE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA!   IVE HAD MEETINGS WITH THEM!
THIS OFFICE LADY IS OPERATING OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF HER PRACTICE/ LICENSE...
ILL BE RECORDING HER NX TIME FOR PROSECUTION.   THIS CANT GO ON....|Stay away from this place this is just a money, Mill, and a pill mill. They cancel and reschedule your appointment for the same thing numerous time over just so they could charge insurance company.
Two nurse practitioners there seem to be extremely unprofessional and only focus on generating money and not taking care of people just by the way to cancel and reschedule the same appointment over and over. On two occasions I was there right by the exit door I've seen cockroaches on the ground. Stay away from this place.|I have not only back issue but other issues I am waiting to see specialist for.
My primary and gastro specialist also are within a group who do not prescribe pain meds. I was sent to another pain place in manyeca and they do not prescribe pain meds. I was finally refered to pain management. I went in with medication in my system. Told the doctor this before I ever tested very first appointment. I could see if I was under contract with them. But no I was red flagged and told there's nothing they can do. My husband works 6sm to 3:30 pm it's not feasible to go to the er every few days to get pain medication. Not only that if you are going there every few days than you will be labeled drug seeking. I am not going to give up the friend who helped me overcome pain management while I was trying to get the referals and appointments. I'm not saying that's the right way. But when a  person is trying to do the right thing and get there own script so they can do it the right way and be turned down it's wrong. If I had signed a contract with you and than showed up with something else not mine in my system than absolutely cut me off. But it was very first appointment and no contracts had been signed.  I'm being sent to specialists for a current situation. It's not just the back problems. Which ate severe enough themselves. . I had been on pain medication many years but my primary fired me for no related issue. I was left reeling and finding a doctor to deal with pain meds is very hard. You have to go to appointments and if you do not care for that new doctor you have to wait a month to see the next new doctor. You find one you like he has to refer to get images to get you to pain clinic this all takes months. I'm sorry I could not handle the pain. And someone helped me. That person should not be punished for showing human kindness. I should not be punished not being under contract. On my very first appointment.|I did my consultation and we decided on a treatment but there was a problem with insurance approval. After sorting out the insurance issue I called and left 8 messages with the referral department over the course of two months but never got an answer or a call back. Two months after that I had given up and was already seeing a different doctor when I got a call saying they had to reschedule the appointment for my treatment due to scheduling issues. Not only was I never informed of this appointment in the first place but that was three weeks ago and I still haven't heard anything about the new appointment.|I see the Dr's or their staff every 3 months and have been very pleased. They are always very friendly and helpful.  Sometimes the wait is a little longer than others, but always within reason.  At the same time I never feel rushed through my visit, as I have with other Dr's I have seen, which have been many over the years.  Thank you for your caring.|I have been a patient there for many years now, i pay cash, and  yesterday at my appointment i was told that they will not schedule my next appointment until my balance of 75 dollars is paid. How sad is that during a pandemic,  as hard as it is to make money because my husband works for the schools that are shut down, so moneys been tight....  and my doctor  is refusing to see me until i pay my account off... i have always made my payments,  and i have been with them for so long to be treated like this very sad... this is a very heartless facility...  i thought it was harsh that within a year period their prices went from 50$ to 75, then to 150, and thats if you only see the assistant.... 200 if you see the Dr... but refusing care during a pandemic is even lower!!! Lets not forget their mandatory drug tests cost 225 each.... the only reason i have a balance was because they raised the price on the drug tests, and gave me 4 tests back to back..... so i don't recommend this facility any longer",2024-10-06|2025-02-06|2024-01-15|2023-06-06|2023-04-10|2023-02-14|2020-01-06|2020-07-21,5|5|1|1|1|1|5|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",74.5|73.25|62.75,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What are the time they pick up the phone.","We answer phone calls from 8:00 AM-4:30 PM MON-THURS and 8:00 AM-2:15 PM on FRI",emergency_appointments|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJeRV4TcVWkIARlU4MWxRwliE,62

Getting TO the provider was also challenging I almost gave up. More on that below. The provider was on time, thorough, and caring. Again, 5* on my appointment.
I am a new patient.  I called and left several messages and received no callbacks. I called again and someone answered (yay). I was asked to fill out online forms before I could have an appointment  I filled out the forms and waited almost a week, then called back and left a message.I called AGAIN, and the person who answered said she couldn't see the forms. She gave excuses for not calling me back. I asked for a supervisor and she put me on a long hold. She came back to the call and said she found the forms. No apology about any of the lack of response from them. The good news is that there was an opening soon and I got an appointment (yay). Overall, very poor assistance. It's important that the front desk is prompt and responsive, especially with a provider for pain and psychiatric services!|Check-in process was swift ON-TIME and professional.
Dr. Ananth was focused, thorough and reassuringly very UP FRONT and HONEST with his examination and evaluation.

The office staff and medical assistant were very helpful and knowledgeable. Dr Ananth took the time to go over everything and to help ease my fears/concerns.|My regular therapist requested I seek a psychiatric evaluation for some challenges I'm experiencing. My insurance listed this office. They were very insistent that I would not be able to see the psychiatrist first. The front office was nice, the psych nurse who did my intake was kind but not thorough in that she kept mixing up my information and appeared to write notes inside of her planner. She did share with me that she was very concerned about my problems and would speak to the psychiatrist, so I felt hopeful about things.

She called me late that evening to state the psychiatrist, who did not meet with me, request any records, or consult with my regular therapist, says I'm stressed. I agree. Part of that is because I am not receiving the care I am requesting. So... the search for a psychiatric provider continues and although other reviews here state he's fantastic with physical health, I cannot attest to any confidence in his ability to provide mental health support.|Very warm and inviting atmosphere!

In fact, today is the second time in the last 5 weeks he's done this for me. He is the best doctor I've ever had. I can't believe how lucky I was to meet him and for him to take me on as a new patient 5 years ago. And I'm not talking about him giving me pain meds or opioids! He's not that kind of doctor so don't ask.

I am a very unique migraine case-maybe 5% of what works for everyone else works for me. He's tried so many things for me and they're finally under control day-to-day. If you're looking for an amazing pain medicine doctor, Dr. Richard Shinaman at PMC is your guy! He's honestly the best doctor I've ever had. Cares about EVERYTHING going on with me not just the pain. He's been so open to trying new things on me and I'm just so thankful he takes my pain seriously. He didn't quit on me when the first 2, 3 hell, 10 things didn't work like ALL of my prior doctors. He genuinely cares and tell me the last time you could say this about ANY of your doctors.

The practice is A++ and so is Dr. Richard Shinaman!!|Dr. Longton and his staff are outstanding. Their pain management care has made it possible for me to maintain my ability to function and a high quality of life for many years. I tried other pain management doctors in the past, but none are as skilled and caring as Dr. Longton and his Physician's Assistant, Brooke.|Dr. Longton, Is the Best.  I had my first injection last month.  I'm due for my second one this week. I do not feel any pain.  And I'm 76 years old.  And this is a FIRST for me not to have Back Pain.  He also did one for my Wife in her neck.  Everything went Beautiful and Doing Great.  Thank you Dr. Longton, and your Wonderful Staff. Everything you need is under ONE ROOF.  That make's it easy for the patients.  And that's what it's all about!  Thank you|Dr Longton was referred by a neighbor who had great results working with him. To date, I've been very impressed with Dr L and hope my treatments yield results. Time will tell. Meanwhile, I'm happy to have a plan and to be working with Dr L on my back pain issues.|I like Dr Longton he's a pleasant man who you can actually have a conversation with many doctors are so clinical. He's very down to earth and caring. I've been going to him since he started his practice and pleasant Hill. I fear that in the future I'll be seeing a lot more of him &  he does his best using his expertise in the pain medicine field to help your orthopedic issue|Dr. Longton treated me for a complicated, chronic issue with my SI joint.  He inspired my confidence with his diagnosis and surgical solution, which resulted in relief for my severe pain. He is a very knowledgeable, capable and caring surgeon; I trust and recommend him fully.|The Bass surgical center has got to be my favorite of all surgical centers I've been seen in. The staff are always friendly and the nursing staff go out of their way to make ones stay as comfortable as possible. Dr Longton has a positive word to say on one's way into the surgery room. He answers questions even at that last minute. This is the 2nd time I've had this procedure, the second time I was in for the procedure, next thing I know, the work is complete. Thank you, PMC!|I've been seeing Dr Longton for a number of years and he(they) have always taken care of me . Brooke is just FANTASTIC.

My husband was in crippling pain and had not slept in days. He did not rush through the appointment, if anything, he took his time, reviewed the xrays and even consulted with my husband's primary physician. He gave helpful therapeutic and medicinal suggestions, and did not give up until he made sure my husband normalized and could lead a pain-free life again. Since that time, I have referred my brother and also my best friend to Dr. Samimi, and they both feel the same way we do - that he is intelligent, listens and figures it out!|Dr. Samimi has been really helpful and caring about what I'm going through. I have neck and upper spine pain as well as an autoimmune disease. Fortunately I was referred to Dr. Samimi by a top rheumatologist several years ago. I appreciate that Dr. Samimi believes and understands what I'm going through, from the first time I met with him. He has come up with pain treatment plans that have been more effective than just taking strong pain meds by themselves, and helped me go off the meds I didn't like.

Dr. Samimi has always been there for me when I've needed him, whether it's answering emails between appointments, calling in refills, and countless other things. He always does his best to work with our insurance to find the best treatment available that can be covered. He always takes his time to listen to me even when I have a lot to go over. He has excellent bedside manners and compassion.

The other doctors that work at the practice are also great. I'd feel confident using any of them.|Wonderful office. Responsive. Average wait time. Never feel rushed.

Tammy his CNA is also professional and courteous.
Pacific Pain Medicine has a lot of treatment plans for you as an individual they do not take a cookie cutter approach like a lot of other providers.|When you live with chronic pain most likely you have been to numerous doctors with varying degrees of satisfaction. When I moved to California my new primary suggested that I see a pain specialist. I was resistant at first having heard of some bad experiences from other people. I was referred to Pacific Pain and I was lucky enough to be given an appointment with PA Jeremy Adler. He was professional, patient, knowledgeable and it was clear he was dedicated to his profession. He listened to my history, took into consideration my input, thought both in and outside of the box.  He used his broad-based understanding of how the body works (and sometimes doesn't)  along with his in-depth knowledge of medicine, how they were designed to work and the broader way they work in the body, to come up with the right regime for me.
He adjusted appropriately as needed.  He stays on top of the latest information in the field and his patients benefit from this. After more years than I care to mention of going from doctor to doctor with not great success he was not only able to get my pain under control but he was able to come up with the correct diagnosis for me, (which numerous specialists had not) and then referred me to the proper specialist resulting in even better quality of life.  His assistant Tammie is equally as professional, caring, and dedicated to doing the best for the people in their care.  I have the utmost respect for Jeremy and highly recommend him and Pacific Pain.|I have suffered with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia for 25 years.  I have seen so many specialists and tried just about every recommendation out there and no one could help me.  I finally found Jeremy Adler and it has been life changing.  He knows more about pain and my health issues than every specialist combined that I've seen.  He is so knowledgeable and he really cares about his patients.  He always listens, answers all my questions, and I never feel rushed or blown off.  He has improved my pain so much that I can now have some enjoyment back in my life.  If you need a pain specialist, he is definitely the one to see!|I found everyone to be very professional, very interested in my condition, and very gentle and respectful when speaking with me about my condition. I'm most impressed With Jeremy Adler and his assistant Tammy. Both are very professional very caring people. I recommend Pacific pain for any condition you might have based completely on my experience.|I have been a patient of Jeremy Adler's for 8-9 years. He is an excellent problem solver, very intelligent & extremely patient. (He is so good that he trains pain management doctors around the county.) He is always aware of the current pain management treatments & technology. When I need injections I see Dr. Perrizo at their Oceanside Outpatient Facility.|Jeremy Adler is an outstanding provider. He listens, takes the time to answer questions and curtails the treatment to one's individual needs. His medical assistant Tammie, is also exceptional.|My life would be significantly different if I didn't have Pacific Pain Medicine as a part of my life. They've never approached my care as a ""one size fits all"", they listen to my needs and wants and always work with me to solve any issues and support my needs. Their outside the box thinking has allowed me to live a relatively pain free life without the permanent side effects of surgery nor side effects of typical opioid medications. They work with the difficult to deal with insurance companies to get me what I need and fight for my needs.
I've dealt with a few other practices to manage my chronic disease and it was always opioids or more procedures (which make them the most money).|Prime example of an arrogant, condescending facility who has no interest in what they do or providing you any relief. They do excel in giving you the run-around. In their view, remember, you're the patient and it's all your fault. My first appointment was outright cancelled and I was turned away at the door because I didn't receive paperwork they claimed they mailed.
They have no time for you to fill out paperwork there. Clearly demonstrating they have no concern for the patient, only what the patient can do for them, i.e. ""we only want your money"".

I am a chronic patient who needs meds, but no calls. I finally called the front desk and still got the answering machine. Finally after 3 weeks I got a call and gave me an appointment in the next 2 weeks. My former pain doctor faxed them all my records but no mercy. I am running out of my meds which my primary doctor can't authorize. I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and cannot live without pain meds and I am running out since I have already reduced the recommended dosage and I am on the verge of going to the ER due to severe pain.
I have not seen their doctors to make any comments but, from the call experience, I am not sure what to expect. Once I get another call to see the doctor soon, I will revise my comments.|I have seen Dr. Owusu for years and he is an amazing doctor. After many medical issues including cancer and non repairable orthopedic problems, I lived a lifetime of pain. I had a limited quality of life and until
I saw Dr. Owusu I began to lose hope. He has provided solution after solution and I've been able to keep working full time and keep up with my young son. They monitor you closely and recommend cutting edge techniques to help you live the best life possible. Dr. Owusu is both compassionate and highly knowledgeable. He has managed my care through multiple surgeries as well. You don't have to live your life in pain! Be open to their suggestions, they really try to help you solve long term problems! Thank you!|Dr.Perrizo and his team and all the support people here are amazing. I had chronic back pain, had the Mild procedure ( minimally invasive lumbar decompression ) and it worked for me.

Pacific Pain Medicine Consultants have helped me deal with the pain in a professional safe approach.  It has made a world of difference to me.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  If I ever need a refill or prior-authorization, the staff and doctors have always had my medicine refills ready (usually within a couple of hours) and the prior-authorizations within 24-48 hours.

Why does healthcare only care about my money and not my well-being? I won't recommend this place if you're in pain.|Everyone was professional, helpful and nice as they were every time I have been in the office. Of course, Dr. Mahrou was awesome and knowledgeable. I trust his advice completely. This is the second time I've been to him for pain management. The first time was such a success, I trust him the second time. He cares completely for his patients. I couldn't ask to be in better hands|Doctor Mahrou has been my doctor for 8 years. During that time he and his staff (Christina specifically) really go above and beyond to make sure all patients are taken care of. I've dealt with many doctors and I've never ever come across one as compassionate and caring for his patients as Dr Mahrou. He genuinely cares for his patients and their medical issues. He is not one to just hand out medication freely he wants to find the root of the problem and give all options of care. I can't say enough good things about him. I truly consider myself blessed that I have a Doctor Who is stuck by me and cared for me the way Dr Mahrou has. When you go into any of his offices you will see the many awards and accolades presented to him for his service in the medical industry. Those are not just pretty wall decorations. He has earned and lived up to each one of those achievements and more.If you are looking for a better quality of life and a wonderful man who will be there to help you achieve that then Dr Mahrou is just the doctor you're looking for. We love Dr Mahrou and the whole staff at Pain Care Providers.|Dr. Mahrou is the best pain specialist I'd ever been to. He takes care of all my needs and really listens when I'm telling him of new pains that are occurring. He's very patient and very professional along with his staff as well. I would recommend him to anyone who ask me for a pain specialist.  Dr. Reza Mahrou and his staff are the best in Orange County.|Dr. Rafizad has terrible bed side manner and does not communicate well with his patients. If you can avoid going to see him for your pain. When going to the doctors for any reason we should be treated well and our needs should be first but that is not how Dr. Rafizad is, he was very rude, had terrible bed side manner with me, and didn't communicate how doctors are supposed to communicate with their patients.. The front desk staff is the same. They give you paperwork without saying a word even your first visit. Usually when I go to doctors offices the front desk is really friendly and helpful but this office NO ONE is... Just awful!|When I first moved to SoCal I needed to find a pain specialist as quickly as possible so that my neuropathy pain could continue being managed without interruption. Dr. Mahrou was the first one that accepted new patients and even arranged an appointment the very next day. Over the years, he has always valued my input before prescribing any medication. I've always felt that it was a team effort and not just being dictated on what to do or what meds to take.

Eventually, Dr. Mahrou suggested a neuro StimPak to help manage the pain in my hands. It has been a godsend. I truly believe it has prevented me from taking even more meds (which I've always been grateful that Dr. Mahrou prefers to find solutions that work rather than just increasing the amount of meds.) I am currently scheduled to go through the trial using the StimPak for pain relief in my feet. The stimulator does not solve the problems I have with pain, but it definitely gives me back a life that I could have easily given up on.

Dr. Mahrou has always made himself available to me, day or night, if I ran into any problems with either my pain medications or the StimPak. He has been an amazing rock at times when I felt my world was crumbling from constant and debilitating pain. He listens, allows me to have input into my own care and has genuinely shown that he cares about me personally. His staff know me by name when I visit and are always cheerful and accommodating. I wish I didn't have the pain, but if I have to have it, I sure am glad I have Dr. Mahrou in my corner.|Pain care Providers is  great clinic managed by Dr. Reza Mahrou. He is very open with his time and helps in any way he can. After 4 knee surgeries and complications with pretty severe back pain & neuropathy, he provides updated medical & technological solutions to help alleviate the discomfort. The staff is very professional, and they follow up quickly.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking to be helped with managing and improving painful conditions.|I suffer from lower back pain and I was miserable and depressed about my quality of life. I was in a pain management program and I had to seek better care. I went to my primary care and asked for new referral.  I selected Dr.Mahrou and my life is amazingly better.  He was very thorough in my consultation and listened to my history of pain. He examined me and ordered MRI'S and lab tests. He scheduled me for epidural for cortisone/steroid and found the exact spot of pain L5 S1. This allows for a nerve block to ensure that precise location. My pain was released from a daily 5 to 7 to no pain. I felt cured. However this wears off but Dr Mahrou found that nerve area where other doctors did not. I moved to Radio frequency ablation and my quality of life has improved 100%. I have received the RFA and it lasted almost a year. I have my joyful personality back that was lost due to chronic pain daily. I am willing to have this procedure annually for my quality of life to be able to appreciate all the things that life has to offer but not able to participate with chronic pain. I have been extremely grateful for Being a patient of Dr.Mahrou.",2024-05-29|2021-08-19|2021-10-16|2021-04-21|2023-05-31|2022-04-08|2021-03-30|2021-03-12,1|5|5|5|1|5|5|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking","Is there a location in Santa Ana for Pain Care Providers","Unfortunately we don't have a Santa Ana Location",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJq98jBGnd3IARfjp3GLlvpLo,75

I am beyond disappointed with my experience at California Back and Pain Specialist. This place is a total scam. They do NOT care about treating your pain or helping you in any way - all they seem to care about is getting your money.
During my visit, I saw no real effort to diagnose or treat my pain. The doctor barely listened to my concerns, rushed through the appointment, and didn't provide any meaningful advice or treatment options. They gave me a generic diagnosis and handed me a bunch of brochures only mentioned INJECTIONS & SURGERY. It was clear they were just trying to upsell me on unnecessary procedures.They pushed me into scheduling more EXPENSIVE appointments, without offering any real solution for my pain.
If you're looking for a place that genuinely cares about your well-being, do yourself a favor and avoid this office. It's all about money here, not your health.  THEY ONLY WANT TO DO INJECTIONS BECAUSE IT PADS THEIR POCKETS.... GREEDY, GRIMEY AND ALL IN ALL --- NOT VERY INTELLIGENT WELL- ROUNDED DOCTORS|Absolutely deplorable behavior from staff. Shady business practices especially from Flor the office manager, and also Elder. You will be lied to and given the run a round saying it's not their problem. You know when they cut corners in the office, it trickles down to the ORs and patient care. I would not trust them, nor this facility that decides to employ such people.|Worst place i ever been in my life. Try to avoid this place if you can. You will waste your time, money and nobody will care about you.|After reading the reviews here, I was honestly a little concerned about coming here. Seeing the ""I do not recommend"" ""avoid at all costs"", I was like ""why'd my attorney send me here out of all places?"" To start, when you walk into the building, it's spotless. The interior design is beautiful. Then the front desk girls are so nice and funny. They got me all set up with the paperwork because I didn't fill out a half that's on their website, but it was no big deal. I waited a little while because they were busy, and then Dr. Lurye came up to me and introduced himself. He was fun and interesting to talk to. He went over my past MRI's with me and told me all of my options for treatment. I agreed to physical therapy, so we'll see how it goes :) thank you!|The best part of this clinic is the people up front. The lady's and Juan, do an awesome job, assisting with any questions or concerns and setting up appointments is easy. The wait time for my procedure was rather long, the patient before me had major procedure done which is why I had to wait as long as I did. I would suggest they manage the patients times better.|Worst place ever. Avoid at all cost. My lawyer sent me here for my motorcycle accident. They never return your calls. I was supposed to get 3 epidural injections. Only got one. They never scheduled me for the other ones. My case closed and I needed a refill on my meds. They flat out refused to refill the meds and said it's not their problem. To go to my primary care doctor if I needed medications. I told the manager that that was illegal. They can't just refuse treatment and stop seeing me without me having medication to get me through till I'm able to get in with another doctor.  I told he I wanted to file a complaint. She said she didn't care and for me to get an attorney if I wanted to file a complaint. Worst customer service in the world. I don't know how she could even be a manager. In my opinion this place is not worth the thousands of dollars  they billed my lawyers office. Avoid at all cost.|I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND COMING TO THIS CLINIC. Here is some details about this clinic. To begin my first appointment was schedule an appointment a month ahead and the day before my appointment they called me to reschedule my appointment. I had already made that day my injection day and I wasn't going to work but until the day before they called to reschedule.
I reschedule my appointment and today was my second reschedule appointment. While being in the waiting room. The room was empty and there were like about 3 people in total in the room they told me that my wife had to leave and wait outside. That's ridiculous that they sent my wife outside in this extreme heat. Not only that but there were another two people that were behind me and they went inside and only one was getting injected. I felt extremely discriminated because there was rarely anybody inside the room and they were kicking my wife out. This is the second time i come to this clinic and  the security gaurd always looked at me in a disgusted way like if I was a homeless or a dangerous. Not only that but they let the security gaurd in but not the customers. This is unacceptable. I recommend taking your business somewhere else.|Amazing migraine doctor, I've been suffering from chronic migraines for 10+ years, I went from one doctor to the next trying to find relief, I finally found Dr. Singh. On my 1st visit I ended up getting a migraine in the office, (nausea, blind spots, pain, all the horrible effects aside from just the pain), they immediately gave me an epi pen type of injection called sumavel and it immediately stopped the migraine. No other doctors I'd seen had even heard of this
medication! Dr Singh is always on top of latest medications for migraines, great listener, great staff. Highly recommend him. I've been a patient for over 5 years, and while the sumavel stopped working for me after a few months, he and his staff are always on the cutting edge of the newest meds and treatments, working tirelessly to help manage my symptoms.",2024-12-03|2024-07-23|2024-12-17|2021-03-26|2020-07-14|2020-07-02|2020-07-10|2018-06-06,1|1|1|5|5|1|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Why is the wait so long.

1.	Appointment Delay: The doctor was 35 minutes late for my appointment. When I arrived, the previous patient's appointment has NOT even started... This indicates extremely poor time management.

2.	Outdated Facility: The furniture and equipment in the office seemed outdated and in need of maintenance, which affected the overall experience.

3.	Inaccurate Diagnosis: While the doctor was friendly and talkative, his medical knowledge is poor. I came in for a consultation about left hip pain but was given an MRI referral for my left shoulder instead...

4.	Billing Issues: I was shocked to receive a bill that was over 10 times higher than expected. Reaching the billing department was challenging since only one person is working for billing and she's out of office half the time. When I finally spoke with someone, I was told the issue was due to my insurance. I later discovered that the doctor is not in-network with major insurance companies like Anthem or Cigna, despite initial impressions given over the phone that they were. They are only in-network with something called Multi-plan, which led to much higher costs for me.

Conclusion: Based on my experience, I would recommend avoiding this practice due to lack of transparency and issues with both service and billing.|Always professional, always caring.

I've been seeing him for years for my chronic back pain (stenosis, herniated disc) and he is always kind and educated. He is my long care Dr and so glad I have him.|Thought I'd see a doctor, but got the appointment with a less educated assistant who literally was more interested in twirling his pen.  Apparently my cancer and 2 other chronic conditions don't warrant treatment here unless it deals with my spine.  This assistant was only amazing himself when he went on and on with the vast knowledge he had regarding the spine treatments.  I even got to hear about his previous employer that did the same such procedures.  He did find a few moments to berate an actual PHD who diagnosed one of my other conditions, so this is why its 2 stars and not 1... he actually listened to that part!|Hi, I went to Dr. Nissan's clinic and didn't even have to wait to get seated in a room. He was very nice and helped me with all my needs. 5 star will come again !|I like the treatment Dr. Nissan provided.  He is easy to talk to and is concerned that his patients get some relief from their pain issues.  The staff is courteous and accommodating.  Unfortunately, my efforts to deal with my pain levels require some form of pain medicine now and I have to switch providers.  If you don't need the meds, Dr Nissan is the doctor to see.|Dr Nissan is a very good and compassionate Doctor. Soft spoken and gentle. He listens to you and tries his best to help with your pain.|I had a T11-L3 fusion in 2003. I had been in extreme pain ever since I broke my back, until I found Dr. Nissan. I had tried everything suggested to me, even Ozone Injections, Blood Cot Matrix injections, Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field Therapy, Cox chiropractic, and more. Somethings helped somewhat, but no real relief for extended period of time, mostly less than a month. I tried two other pain specialists that gave steroid injections, but relief was not great and did not last long. My pain level was always 6-8, and often a 9 or 10. Getting very frustrated, I searched for a new pain doctor, and I found Dr. Nissan. He performed a total of 4 steroid injections on me at L3-L4, L4-L5, SI joint, and L hip in 2019.  That is the best I had felt since breaking my back!! I am so grateful for Dr. Nissan and his excellent care. He is so compassionate, a great listener, and he really cares about his patients. After seeing multiple doctors, therapists, chiropractors, etc., Dr Nissan is the only one who really got me any significant and lasting relief. I highly recommend him. In late 2019 I moved too far to be able to see him for treatments, and I have yet to find another pain specialist even half as good as Dr. Nissan.|Not that I'm pain-free--that's not going to happen with Fibromyalgia and aging faculties--but I'm better. Dr. Nissan has not only helped me regain a level of physical functionality that I can live with as a woman in her 50s, but he has also played an important role in restoring my dignity and confidence, not as another statistic of chronic pain sufferers added to the list, but as my own woman of color who deals with chronic and acute pain symptoms.

The first time I was prescribed a medication for my back and waited days to hear back only to have my pharmacy tell me it's never been sent in so I called they gaslit me and said it was sent in, I accepted that answer sighed and hung up and magically the pharmacy got the script shortly after. Then this most recent time I waited a whole week and nothing so I called and nothing, then I called the next day and waited on hold for over 20 mins for them to tell me it was my fault the prescription wasn't sent in because I didn't hand over my old meds. I was never told this, they never called to tell me and I wouldn't have known unless I called, it also doesn't take 20 mins to come up with that. I will still come but have an advocate because these people DO NOT CARE about their mentally ill patients and have no accommodations for people like me. No communication and if you reach out it is absolutely horrendous. They weren't short staffed either so there's no excuse|**UPDATE: FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT**

Prior to my mother's follow-up appointment, I called the office to confirm the time. It took multiple tries to reach the front desk, and unfortunately the same receptionist answered the phone and responded in the same manner, rude and dismissive. Not even a, ""Have a nice day"" at the end of the call.

By this point I am contemplating not even coming back, but this isn't about me it's for my mother. While we were in the waiting area for her name to be called, the same receptionist had attitude with patients over the phone, like they were inconveniencing her by calling.

This is difficult for me because everyone else in the office has a much better attitude than her. From the nurse who took my mother's vitals, to the doctor who gave her treatment. I am only continuing to come here until they can figure out my mother's condition.

I would love to say this office is great and welcoming. Unfortunately, for the (heavyset) receptionist being there, it is not and I would recommend to look elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------

**This review is mainly for the (heavyset) receptionist at the  front desk**

My mother was referred to this office through her insurance, so this was our first visit. We received a text message stating to arrive 30 minutes prior to our appointment to fill out paperwork. As we are from out of town, it is often difficult to anticipate traffic in the Bakersfield area (I would also like to note that they had not given me the address, I had to look it up on my own). It was in an area where there are multiple clinics and offices, and I didn't realize they were located behind the building.

Upon arrival the receptionist seemed annoyed and immediately stated that we were late and that the paperwork would take 30 minutes to fill out (we were AT LEAST 5 minutes late). I'm not sure if she meant anything behind her tone, but I was hoping she would not cancel our appointment at that moment, especially driving from out of town. I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, so she probably had a bad morning. She gave us the paperwork and reiterated how much we had to fill it out before her appointment.

I noticed while filling out the paperwork, the same receptionist had a totally different attitude towards other patients that came in, much nicer more welcoming.

Filling out the paperwork was fine, as I have done this plenty of times before, rearing the end all it needed was my mother's signatures. The receptionist then called us over again only to ask if we were finished filling out the paperwork and stated how much time we had left (again we had at least 5 minutes left before her appointment, minutes wasted calling us over). We finished just in time with minutes to spare, and they even called her 5 minutes after her appointment.

I understand how important keeping an appointment is, it definitely goes both ways. However the way we didn't feel welcomed and somewhat chastised by the receptionist was very discomforting. I will make sure in future appointments to ask for someone else.|Doctors Wilson is great but the office staff could use some work on dealing with patients.  It's made known on the voice message when calling for refills that they won't contact about your refill so I guess if problems arise you're out of luck.  There's also about a dozen different mailboxes to choose from for requesting refills via voice mail.  I can see how messages can get lost in the shuffle.  The receptionists seems to always have an attitude.  I used to bring my father here years back and noticed a really inappropriate Willy Wonka meme taped to the window where you check in with a caption to effect of ""so tell me know how you running out of your meds is my problem.""  I see that's gone now but that pretty much sums up the process of dealing with this staff.

I recently contacted them via voicemail to refill my pain medication.  For the last four months I had to call monthly for every refill and never had an issue.  I noticed a few days later I had a refill available from the VA website (I am a VA veteran referral) so I requested a refill from there and of course it's the VA so it's late.  I don't know if an extra refill was called into the VA or if they noticed I had a refill and just ignored my request.  Either way I flunked out of the Jedi mind reading academy so if I hadn't noticed this extra refill, I'd still be waiting on medication that was apparently never ordered.  Better late than never I guess.

So now I'm off meds that are starting to cause headaches and insomnia from the withdrawals but like Willy Wonka says, how is this their problem?!  It'll probably be up to another week for the VA to deliver.  It's bad enough having to deal with the VA but adding another VA level, or worse, third-party into the process and I'm done.  I'll just wait the withdrawals out and save the tax payers some money by not returning.|The staff were very kind and helpful. Dr.Palencia and Jacob Osborne FNP were Amazing!!!

Everyone there.|Wish I could give negative stars. Absolutely atrocious!!! RUDE!! RUDE!! RUDE!! Uncaring, condescending, short tempered. Dr. Fisher is one of the worst humans I have ever been unfortunate to come upon. She is beyond rude! Comes in doesn't introduce herself when I left I had no idea who she was. Began with a barrage of questions that felt more like an interrogation then a doctor patient discussion. Her accent is so thick and she talks so fast I kept having to ask her what she said which didn't make her talk slower or more distinctly it only irritated her making her even more rude and short tempered. She never discussed with me my condition. She simply set me up for two injections which I did not want. I told her I wanted to know what was wrong and never received an answer. Then never telling me why she says she's going to send me to a neurologist. I quickly told her I had one and her name. Well, my neurologist's name is difficult to pronounce and both Dr. Fisher and the girl who was with her (who'd been snickering the entire time at Dr. Fisher's behavior) said they'd seen her name on my papers and began to make fun of it sarcastically pronouncing it all different ways like two bullies in elementary school. This is professional?!?!?

Every nurse in that front office should be fired. They don't care about patients about the patients in pain or themselves. Once I'm done with this review I will be filing a complaint with the bbb and the medical boars of California and hopefully have there license taken away. I hope every nurse in the front does not get the pain management they need when there hurt and it festers like a bloody boil. When you call an office I hope they hang up in your face and you have no solutions no help and no hope. I will be suggesting to my lawyers to shut this facility down and go to another site. Thank you.|Dr. Kevin Smith and his chief colleague, Alex Filen, P.A. truly care for their people and practice with a competence on a higher level even than other ""board certified"" specialists. As a person with chronic pain due to arthritis there have been seven or eight other orthopedists, neurologists, a couple of other primary care doctors who claim to specialize is helping people with tough problems, who did not measure up this high.

On my first appointment with Dr. Smith he pointed out that one of the prescriptions written by a ""board certified"" orthopedist was causing my blood pressure to rise unreasonably high. Stopping that drug was more than worth the price of admission as they say.

For the past two years or more there have been many interactions with myself and the staff at Integrated Pain. Everything has been pleasant and in tune with my needs. Remember there are a lot of people involved when you are dealing with these prescriptions. Everyone along the line has to pay attention.

I'm part of an internet circle of people who have chronic pain and who use pain management services from Great Brittan, to the U.S., to Australia. As one lady put it, ""Pain that won't go away makes me cranky."" That is very true and must be kept in mind when considering some of these reviews.

One of the members of my group is in Tucson, AZ, where her stories of encounters with Emergency Room people and new treatment centers are just humiliating and hurtful.

There are only good things to be said for Dr. Smith, the Most Reverend Alex Filen, and the staff. Thank you goes out to them for their caring.|I have no words that will convey how grateful, appreciative, and thankful I am for the entire staff, Dr. , admin.
I've suffered with chronic pain for more than 30 years. I am not a mover and a shaker, but I'm also not a sitter.  And sitting was all I was managing until Dr.Smith and staff.
I have a pain pump now and I'm off the couch. So how do you thank someone who has taken you from the couch back outdoors?
Thank you.
Ches Westerlund|A very calm and peaceful environment upon entry.

I was greeted with a smile and immediately put at ease with Jiana. She thanked me for getting the forms in the evening prior which cut down on the wait time for my appointment.

A very short wait And I was called back by the RN Amy. Once again put at ease immediately. She smiled and was down to earth as we covered the basics and discussed our siblings (my sister came with me for support...She doesn't usually care for doctors or facilities for that matter... Just saying. I was honestly a little bit nervous she might get feisty because she can do that!)

Dr Kevin Smith entered the room shortly thereafter and, noticed by my sister, had a full page of handwritten notes that she mentioned to me later...means old school...we liked that. I was very pleased with a no sugar coating honest consultation and the fact that he actually read my MRI and notes prior to the appointment...was a relief! We didn't have to spend 20 minutes talking about why I was there. He already knew. More old school stuff. Love it! This doctor looks you in the eyes when he's talking to you he discussed a few things that were not included in my referral from my spine doctor. I concluded that Dr. Kevin Smith truly wants the HELP to find the least restrictive solution for living well. I didn't get the feeling that I was just another name coming through his office. He smiles and laughs and just gives you the feeling that you are spending time with an old friend discussing the days of old sitting on the veranda with an ice cold glass of sweet tea.

I don't think I could give a sweeter review than that. Thank you very much to the team at Integrated Pain Specialists of Southern California!

I look forward to going back for my spine injections with this team of professionals!

Should not work in this specialty. Zero stars.|Dr. Moon is great and he truly cares.  He has a great bedside manner as well.

If they gave Michelin stars to Drs. as well as restaurants, Dr. Moon would be the ever elusive 5 star Michelin. He is wonderful.|Both Drs are very bad...run, don't walk from this office, but RUN!!  (If you want to live).  These Drs are verbally abusive & cannot admit to their misdiagnosis & in my opinion are most dangerous.  Their ""concern"" is for show ONLY.  They can & WILL turn on you without warning...give 'em time.|I got my non-surgical procedure/ epidural for herniated disc few months ago from other doctor but soon enough pain came back again. I felt how I became weakened and susceptible to pain despite taking pain-killers and muscle relaxers I was previously prescribed. However, visit to Dr.Moon has changed my life. He truly wants to manage and help me handling pain with various options available and suitable for me. I can say that I will trust him in fully with my back as well as my widespread pain all over my body. Most important part is how truly he takes sincere approach to soothe my pain. Thank you|Dr. Roger Moon is very experienced, gentle doctor. I have been bringing my mom to Dr. moon for back, neck, and shoulders pain treatment and he has been so passionate, and kind.. He gives us as much time as we need, listens to his patients and been always very accurate with his diagnosis... My mom and I are very happy with him and we really recommend him to any one who is looking for an excellent, kind doctor to go too..

He said he wasn't surprised by my pain because my gallbladder was not working at all. If he knew I was going to be in pain, then why didn't he give me pain pills for my recovery.

Super sparkling clean. The receptionist was cordial and checked me in promptly.

My wait time between each one was minimal and my epidural was quick and relatively painless once I adjusted my body to lie face down on the table because I could not lie flat.  The only downside was that the Doctor came in afterwards and I never saw his face, but he had a gentle manner that immediately put me at ease and although I awkwardly positioned myself, I was able to relax. He explained exactly what I would feel as he proceeded and it was over before I knew it.

I look forward in getting care from Dr. Lim and his staff.|Right from the start my experience with this medical provider was very good. First they called me right after my primary doctor sent them the referral. Second, I got an appointment within 10 days of the referral from my primary doctor. When I arrived, the office staff and the medical assistants were nothing but courteous, professional and personable. The doctor and the other medical professionals were all upfront, informative, personable, and quick. My procedure was done without delay.

From the moment I walked in, the entire staff was attentive, professional, and genuinely friendly. The facility itself was spotless and clearly followed all necessary sterile processes, which made me feel safe and confident.
The pre-procedure process was efficient yet thorough. The team took the time to answer all my questions patiently and made sure I fully understood the procedure. At no point did I feel rushed or pressured -everyone, including the doctor, prioritized my comfort and peace of mind.
What stood out most to me was their humanity. They were not only professional but also very understanding and compassionate, which made a potentially stressful experience feel much easier to handle. I truly appreciated how they treated me as a person, not just a patient.

Finally you know took 2 months to get all the stuff together and really inconvenienced me and the first day of my appointment they requested a urine test and I guess I didn't pass it cuz the next appointment. The doctor not even the doctor Nelson the PA told me I'm never going to be eligible for any painkillers ever cuz I my test came back with something in it that they don't like and I told them up front that I had this and that you know cuz I said I was self-medicating because I've been in pain for 2 years and so anyway. Meanwhile they've been giving medial blocks and a epidural and nothing works. I've been in pain the whole time I've been with them and they've given me no advice whatsoever. I had to request physical therapy from them and that's helping me but I'm in pain all the other times and they're not going to give me any painkillers and I know that would work cuz I'm not in pain 24 hours a day. I don't like 24 hours a day. I just need a pill to take but I know I'm going to be in pain because I'm doing something horrible like my housework or my hair taking a shower. All of that is painful and I just need something but they just won't do it so they have been totally useless to me. It's just been a lot of trouble to have to keep getting ready for these surgery type issues that it's not surgery. It's a needle in my back for for one minute and it takes one minute for them but takes me a whole 24 hours to get ready cuz I have to have to fast and then I have to wear certain clothing. I have to get a ride there cuz I don't have a car and then I have to have a ride. Pick me up and this whole thing is just so frustrating for me. I need to find a doctor who who'll do something about my pain. This place could care less and I have a really bad back issue and they said so too.|I want to thank Ryan Nakasone and staff for ALWAYS treating me with Patience and respect not only to myself but to my girls. Sometimes I have to take them and then assistance we get is immediately as I enter the door p. I'm in a wheelchair and need help and with a smile I get it without asking. I have lots of health issues and Ryan has saved my life twice due to infections that he noticed as soon as i was seen.  He seen me sent me to hospital right away and my family and I thank him and agreed that this is a provider that cares . Hospital agreed that i could off died had an emergency surgery within an hour. Again THANK YOU ALL AT SPANISH HILLS.|Large off putting angry woman with glasses at the front desk is an absolutely horrible excuse for a human being. We were 12 minutes early for our appointment and she immediately tells us we had to reschedule. We apparently had to complete paper work prior to our arrival. She refused to give us the paperwork to complete and turned us away. She is a very rude and heartless person who seems to take pleasure in rejecting patients appointments. This woman rudely says ""If you can read our sign"" on the counter that states patients 15 minutes late have to reschedule. Yes I can read thank you. I can also read your body language and demeanor that you are a miserable human being.

We were 12 minutes early btw not 15 minutes late. She clearly had decided on her own her Dr's would not be seeing us that day.

How she has a job dealing with people at the front desk is mind boggling. If she represents this office the doctors are probably horrible as well. Stay away and tell your friends to stay away. Zero stars and she should be fired. I feel sorry for anyone that has to work with that creature and patients forced to use this clinic.|Absolutely disgusting treatment of my family. Front desk woman should be fired. We took my immobile  70 year old mother  in law in a wheelchair which is difficult enough to get her around to any office  and took time off work to get her to office arrived 10 minutes early, between the rehab center and the appointment the paperwork was to our surprise not completed. The front desk woman was extremely rude and refused to give us the paperwork to fill out then and there, and told us that we had to come back and reschedule Appointment . We asked why we couldn't just fill out the paperwork there to which she told us ""can you read the sign."" The sign says if you were late, you have to schedule a new appointment appointment. We were not late we were early. She told us we had to come back Monday, which would mean another day off work and another difficult task of getting there all to be dismissed on a Technicality on our way out the office Lady refused to give us the paperwork then to fill out he told her no thank you we will not be visiting this office ever  again for your despicable Treatment of people.|I love this group & my Dr. I've been going there over 2 yrs now. Dr Buchanan helped me more in the 1st few visits than all the 4 yrs total at my previous pain mgt office.|I'm not sure who peed in the cheerios of the people complaining about the staff in this office but I have to STRONGLY disagree. I have been a patient of Dr. Kia for 2 years now and not only is he a very kind, caring, excellent doctor, everyone in the building is as well. Irma at the front is truly a gift of pure love.  Elizabeth who answers the phone is always helpful with anything I call about and always has a cheerful demeanor, as is Valorie or anyone else who answers. All of the medical assistants respond promptly to any requests or questions. They are a busy office BECAUSE they are so good. Have you considered that? I know we are all in pain, and that makes it difficult not to be grumpy all the time, but don't take it out on the office staff of the doctor who is there to help you with your pain. They  are genuinely warm, caring people. I bet if you treat them as such you'll get the same in return. I am not related to nor personally connected to anyone in this office - I'm just a rando patient like anyone else. But when I see good people being mistreated I have to say something.|Do not go to this facility and especially do not use Caitlyn Tourje. She is un-professional and at best rude.|My name is Maria Medina and Ryan Nakasone is my provider. Ryan has not only been a GREAT provider but he literally saved my life one day when he sent me to the hospital because he was concern about me on my last visit. He took his time to call me on a saturday morning to check up on me i told him i was still in pain & had fever he sent me to the ER and i was really bad with sepsis and was told I made it on time . Hes a provider that really cares about his patients and ALL of the staff there REALLY cares about my girls and I. I no longer have legs and they help me and my lil ones as soon as i get there with no complaints.

They are what  contributes to ruining lives in our community. Overprescribing their patients getting them hooked on opioids so that their tolerance increases constantly, not doing any due diligence to make sure their patients aren't getting hooked. Thank you pain associates for ruining our family! My husband is now on upwards of 10 a day, lying, hiding, taking it with alcohol....I would be appalled with myself if this was my profession. You give him a prescription for 90 pills in a month and in 3 days has gone through 40. That's how your ""medicine"" is being used. Legal drug dealers|Dr Barkow, Shasha and his staff are amazing. I had a painful digestive issue. No other doctor figured out what was wrong with me I was told it was a chronic condition, I would have to live the rest of my life immobilized in pain unable to eat.

I went to Dr. Barkow in two minutes he diagnosed me correctly. I did have to go back to my primary because it was a physiological condition that needed surgery. Basically my cervical spine has collapsed entrapping my Vega Nerve. Surgery was a success.

I have cone back to Dr. Barkow for a  lower lumbar condition. I trust him to help me. And if he cannot,  to tell  me so and send me to the correct Dr.

In any case this Doctor is the real deal!|After Dr. Barkow passed, I was treated as a drug addict. Dr. Barkow was the kindest, most compassionate pain management doctor in OC. The new ""doctors"" are more concerned with money and less concerned about their patients who do require medication.|This review is LONG OVERDUE! I want to thank ALL those who work  at OCPM. I have been a patient for over 16 years. I have had 3 spinal/ spinal cord surgeries and  suffer from Adhesive Arachnoiditis, which is extremely painful. Thankfully the medical staff (mostly Dr. Barlow before his unfortunate passing and now Steve Rhyan PA and Dr. Dedes) has kept my pain well managed.  I can't thank you enough for giving a quality of life that's worth living.

Although I appreciate all of the great care given by the people mentioned above, I wanted to specifically thank the office staff and Nghiem. Many times the workers behind  the scenes get overlooked. Therefore, I wanted to send my gratitude to all of them and highlight Nghiem. He has worked there for many years. Over time he has been promoted up to office manager.  This is understandable.  Anyone that has Nghiem as an employee is lucky and should hold onto him. Anytime I have called and spoke with him about something I needed he personally made sure that it was 110% completed.   I have always been so thankful for him because when you suffer from chthe last thing you want to do is fight with the insurance company or work with the pharmacy when it was an error on their part. Most recently I needed a copy of my chart and if possible in electronic format. As I mentioned before I have been a patient for 16 years. My medical record is hundreds of pages long.  He personally took the job on and not only was it in electronic form but it was done quickly.   Some offices only provided it in paper form, which is fine. It is understandable if  they couldn't do it; but  this just illustrates the quality of care Nghiem provides. I know it's not just me that he gives fantastic When I am in the office I have seen and heard him providing the same care for all.

When looking for a pain management doctor, it's important that you find someone who can effectively treat your physical pain. In addition, it is equally important that the doctor/PA has  great people working for them. I can't think of any better example of an exemplary care other than Nghiem and the entire OCPM staff. Thanks again for caring for me for the past 16 years.  All of your efforts have given me back a great quality of life. For that I am forever grateful.|Dr. Barkow,   the staff and Sasha RULE !! I want Dr B to become my primary MD.  But not sure he does that .. We handle all my pains with  Botox for migraines .. Works VERY Well , Highly recommended !! Cutting Edge in the pain and discomfort field..  Dr Barkow alerted me on another issue none of my several Dr.s spotted.  I've just got out of surgery for the red-flag  ailment Dr B  pointed out.. Quality of life is better already.. Thank You ALL !!! BB <3|I am in the process moving to SoCal and transferring my patient information from Central California to Dr. Barkow's office. His staff members are understanding and compassionate - and they have been very upfront about Dr. Barkow's practices regarding pain management. I am beyond impressed with how far they are going for someone who isn't even yet a patient. His staff is truly top-notch and I look forward to Dr. Barkow overseeing my treatment.|I recently started seeing Dr. Barkow and the team due to chronic pain in my back and shoulder.  I had a very bad day about a month ago and ended up going to Urgent Care and the ER both of which could not tell me anything that was wrong with me and chalked it up to fibromyalgia.  Dr. Barkow took the time to listen to me examine me and sent me to get X-Rays and an MRI. Low and behold there was something wrong and I am now on a treatment plan and getting the pain relief I need to start to be able to live a better life. Thank you Dr Barkow|Dr. Barkow staff is exceptionally nice the girl at the counter was slightly uneducated about all the processes that I believe she should have known. Dr. Barkow is a very narrow-minded thinker he said I was too complicated I do not need to hear that from my man who spent years in school to learn how to manage pain. He suggested steroid injections knowing I have osteoporosis I've been told that that is not a good idea by several Dr yet he still wants to proceed. He does not prescribe pain medicine if you are looking for a multi managed approach he is not the man to see if you want to stab in the back then I would say go because he's more than eager to do that. He will be taking an x-ray of my back my back was my secondary complaint my hips for my primary complaint certainly he should be taking an x-ray of my hips as well. However I suppose that's one more thing that he just doesn't do.",2024-02-24|2018-09-14|2021-03-25|2021-09-20|2016-11-17|2016-09-20|2018-06-22|2018-06-22,1|5|1|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJmZ67lJLu3IAR37WVTRtidok,24

After her injection, my grandma was back on her feet and had no pain. She is the best and most professional pain management doctor.|Dr. Avagyan is great!

By the time I ended up here, through a maze of other providers,  I was desperate. He's approachable and personable, super easy to talk to, with boundless energy. Every five appointments I've had with him: new patient, infusion, video visit, in-office follow-up, procedure ... all of densely packed and helpful, clear strategy with rationale for treatment that makes sense. I love that he never phones it in, always engaged, laser-focused, never rushes, not distracted, takes the time to answer questions. He listens attentively and is remarkably responsive to nuance. Before my first appt., though hopeful and excited, I was apprehensive that I might have to waste my time listening to a hundred suggestions, all of which, over decades, I've already done. I was blown away by the new hypotheses and approaches Dr. Shirvalkar came up with.  I'm a 'glass-full person' and his optimism further buoyed me. He's knowledgeable and seasoned, knows his domain. When I went in for my cervical facet joint injections, I loved his skillful precise and deft technique--pinpointed in target, smooth and seamless... everything you'd want when needles are involved :-) He does not think cookie-cutter, not follow a prescribed flow chart. From the first appointment, he grokked the complexity of my case, that I've been around the block and needed a no-nonsense approach of targeted treatment. I immediately sensed that he ""got"" it, the extent of my chronicity and severity, that I'd been managing for a long time. He never invalidated or minimized what I was reporting. Though this might sound like ""duh,"" and you might assume a provider wouldn't do this, I've experienced over and over again a type of invalidating. Dr. Shirvalkar does the opposite: he validates my subjective experience and is focused on finding a solution, on helping my symptoms, on easing the level of pain. He exudes a sense of caring and sincerely wanting my pain to be better; he genuinely puts in the time and hard work of thinking through the problem to come up with multiple possible solutions. He conveys them clearly, e.g. ""We've done A., and if this last., we'll do A. Again. If A doesn't last, we'll do B., If not B., ... "" This simple 'If then else' structure is crucial, because it injects me with hope. I live on hope. It's my food and water. This is priceless and he gives it not as mere communique, but as part of the treatment itself. He has cognitive openness that does not lend itself to bias, e.g. though I came in with a diagnosis emphasizing ""X,"" he did not stay within these bounds of ""X,"" and looked beyond. It's outside of this sphere, that we found another possibility: ""Y,"" leading to another set of treatments, which has given me some relief. Dr. Jessica Marrone, the fellow who did a portion of my procedure, was solid and I loved how she came in beforehand to explain a distinction between nerves I didn't understand. Gabriel, Dr. Shirvalkar's assistant, is conscientious with follow through, kind and empathetic in telephone interactions. I feel so lucky to have access to this place and their services.This UCSF Center for Pain Medicine, access to a wealth of assessment, interventions ... all of it is bomb.|Dr. Heidi Reetz is the best pain doctor one could hope to find. When I first visited her office, the neuropathy in my feet felt like standing in two buckets of fire and my hands would lock up to the point I could not move them. I could not dress myself. The kicker: something in my health condition is causing hypersensitivity to medication. Respectfully, she helped me find an approach to my condition that has resulted in a cumulative healing path, working against conditions indicated as incurable and chronic. There are aspects of my total condition to address, though managing the pain aspect has taken a progressive path enough to say I am aiming for a life direction I thought was completely lost. Recovery takes time, willingness, patience, awareness, and behavioral change. Show up in the right mindset, hang in there, and Dr. Reetz will advocate for you and see it through as far as possible. Don't give up.|The UCSF Pain Management Center went beyond their expectations. With a holistic approach and expert guidance, they found relief from persistent pain they thought was insurmountable.  Full of gratitude for the support received, they enthusiastically recommend the center to anyone in search of effective pain management solutions.  #PainFreeAtLast #UCSFHealingHands|Dr. Henry and Dr. Cheng and their nurses have been amazing.  I have been in constant pain since I was injured 3/10/1999. the epidurals worked great but the steroids that made me feel better also caused me to gain A LOT of weight. Once the trial Spinal cord stimulator had time to work, I was finally almost pain free.  I can not wait until the permanent unit is installed on Tuesday.|I was never able to schedule an appointment. I called multiple times a week for several weeks, left multiple voicemails, and tried different phone numbers. I got one single call back the very first time, which I missed because I was on a work call. Despite me calling them back numerous times, and having a referral from my neurosurgeon that was sent to them, I was never able to schedule a single appointment.

I wish I could give more stars because I wish I'd actually been able to get in touch and receive their services. They need some serious improvements on the communication and scheduling front.|WARNING! 

I brought my partner here to see Dr. Yu to address her hip and ankle pain. What she received was an offensive and degrading experience and a far cry from proper medical care.

Dr. Yu and his student, Dr. Ly degraded my partner for having ""too many"" health conditions and chastised her for using a wheelchair despite her having a disability.

The doctors were ill-prepared for the appointment and were completely unaware of her medical history. They possessed such fragile egos that when they weren't able to think of a viable treatment plan, they resorted to blaming the patient.

In the end, Dr. Yu and his team of crackpot students' ""expert"" medical recommendations were to stop seeing her other UCSF specialists that have been necessary for managing her chronic conditions, spend less time at the doctor's and more time ""living life"", and to embrace positive thinking to mentally overcome her pain. Suffice to say, the UCSF pain management clinic is the most inept, unprofessional, and dangerous medical facility I have witnessed. What a complete joke. Do NOT go here if you have other options.|I requested to be seen here based on ucsf's reputation in medicine. My MD refered me here 3 months ago, then provided additional requested records 2 months ago. Still no response from UCSF. Just left a voicemail and based off the message, it's no wonder. Sounds.like one VERY bored bureaucrat is handling all new referrals. Do better UCSF.|Gave excellent care. Very empathetic and comforting .

I feel trapped and threatened by him as he knows I don't have a choice with this machine in me, SO he is my God according to his attitude and does not listen or give me a choice! Also, I believe because of his culture he believes and treats women as second class citizens. If anyone can help me, please let me know, I'm truly lost, stuck and feeling very abused!

I have been visiting the Irvine office in last couple months. I am a very to the point person. So let me summarize my experience with them:
1.	He is caring and patient with great bedside manner. He listened carefully and suggested different path to reach my goals in few and simple words.
2.	There is no sales talk in this office. no pushing, You decide and move forward.
3.	Making an appointment was easy and fast.
4.	I visited the office only at lunch time and there was NEVER waiting pass my appointment time.
5.	Staff and the Doctor are very friendly, welcoming, and personable.
6.	The most important of all I got results - as I wanted!!|I've been seeing Claudia for almost 2 months now. She is so kind, very knowledgeable, and made me feel so comfortable from the beginning of my journey. I can't thank her, the Dr. and stuff enough! I highly recommend this office. They are not pushy they don't try to oversell just genuinely nice people that want to help!!! Thank you so much for everything!|He's listed twice on Yelp which shows of professionalism of his staff. They don't care about you and they treat you as a second-class citizen. I've had appointments and have been made to wait over 45 minutes each time. The first appointment the staff completely screwed up my request for my insurance I had to fix it myself. If you want to do everything yourself this is a great place. The doctor seems to know what he's doing, although he's always running late. At my injection which was the first one in the morning he was late each time. The last time he was so late that the anesthesiologist was going to leave. Apparently it's a common practice according to the staff. Find someone else who can treat you well and respect your time.|Doctor Sedaghat is an incredibly caring and knowledgable physician. My family and I have all visited his practice for various reasons; from pain management consults, to effective weight-loss programs and cosmetic procedures, Dr. Sedaghat has been there for all of us and has provided us with the best care possible over the past few years. He takes time to listen to patient's concerns and explains all possible options to you. I am eternally grateful to Dr. Sedaghat for all that him and his warm and welcoming staff have done for us. I could not have asked for a better physician. Also, shout out to the office coordinator, Claudia, who is always helpful and welcoming.|Best Doctor I have  ever had. Dr. Sedaghat listens to you and cares about your medical history, your current problems and Your Pain. He's a very passionate Doctor who is empathetic, professional and truly knowledgeable about all the latest treatment available. I'm in my 60's now and have been a patient for 5+ years. The Doctor and the Staff are the best. Thank you so much Dr. Sedaghat for keeping me out of my wheelchair and moving around, walking short distances and as active as I can be with all my ailments. I would not be moving around without your care! Sincerely, Ms. Michele Morris|I recently started seeing Dr. Sedaghat for my knee pain. It is unpredictable to know if there will be a wait when I arrive or not but that's typical for medical offices. I am aware of the fact that some appointments take longer than others so it doesn't bother me to wait sometimes. The medical assistants are very caring and Ive had no problems so far. The doctor himself is very knowledgeable and takes the time to find the root of my problem. My previous pain management doctor always seemed to rush me but Dr. Sedaghat is truly compassionate and takes his time. Looking forward to my next appointment|I feel so lucky to have found Dr. Sedaghat for my mother. I go with her to every appointment and the staff is friendly and professional and we rarely have to wait for our scheduled time. The best part of this office, though, is Dr. Sedaghat himself. He is extremely knowledgeable and compassionate. My mother suffers from chronic pain but, additionally, she is a dialysis patient and just had open heart surgery. Dr. Sedaghat not only treats her chronic pain, but also makes sure he is up to date on all aspects of my mother's health and that the treatment that he gives is appropriate for someone with her conditions. He even makes sure to research how a dialysis patient eliminates certain medication dosages before he considers prescribing them! I've never met a doctor that is this responsible and cares so much. I wouldn't recommend anyone else.|I happen to know him through his neighbor office, the Physical therapy office. After repeated visits with the PT, he suggested to see Dr. Sedaghat. He took me there and introduced me to him. He made some injections to my knee and the pain went away.
Ever since, my family members and I go to him for any pain management.

Moreover, his kind approach with us and taking his time to listen to us and taking proper action is very impressive.

I highly recommend him for his expertise, and fairness.",2023-04-04|2024-02-02|2019-03-07|2022-03-14|2018-07-08|2019-08-17|2019-11-06|2022-08-25,5|5|1|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJF0WHwnzZ3IARTh0nNZecChc,17

I have just begun my journey with Dr. Ky. What I have noticed is he respects his patients because he runs his practice like a well oiled machine. I have been to both, his office and surgery center. Both places, you get tended to within 5 or 10 minutes. No sitting, waiting to be treated. Thank you Dr Ky and staff
In case I didn't mention, is staff is friendly, knowledgeable and easy to talk to.|Dr. Paul Ky and his team at Advanced Pain Solutions in Fresno California, are hands down the best pain specialist the central valley California has to offer. After seeing many specialist who either treated me like a drug addict and gave me virtually no help or hope that I would be able to live and even halfway normal life again after my back injury and subsequent botched back surgery that only made everything much worse . Dr ky was a breath of fresh air, he is an honest man who gives you the facts and does everything he can to help you regain as much mobility with as little pain as possible. I had been told by several neurologist, neurosurgeons and other pain specialist that after using a cane for almost 3 years, due to severe weakness of my legs and pain in my lower back and neck that I would probably be in a wheelchair by the time I was 50. That was about 15 years ago,  I can happily report that I just turned 50 in May and I no longer use a cane my legs are stronger than ever and I have a bright and happy future to look forward to. I highly recommend anyone looking for a compassionate and straightforward pain specialist that will do his damnedest to give you the best care possible and continues to educate himself as to new treatments available, that you visit Dr ky at Advanced pain solutions in Fresno California, he has been my guardian angel. He, his staff and other providers in is office will never know how much I appreciate and depend on his guidance for further treatment. So thank you all at Advanced pain solutions for giving me hope and allowing me to play with my grandchildren and really just for giving me a second chance at having a life with as little pain possible, which I had all but given up on, untill my first visit with you?|07/31/24 This is the first time I see his doctor Paul Ky, MD. He answered all my questions and I Mary answer all Paul Ky M.D. questions.
So far, pretty good. PAUL Ky MD. is very polite and gentle.
And I think Pual Mk M.D. gonna do a lot for my pain that I have. Paul Ky M.D. says I have very weak Bones and my nervous system Needs to be improved. Needs blood flow and my blood flow is very poor. That's why I am so much pain and Paul Ky. M.D. help me to understand how he's gonna help me on this pain if I give him 5 Star. That is very good Because the way he talks to you. M.D Paul K y is Doctor  very well|Dr Ky and PA Scott are wonderful. I've never had a Doctor tell me they didn't care about my weight, because it wasn't what caused my back and neck issues. I've haven't had such an understanding PA in several years. Dr. Ky listens and addresses my concerns. PA Scott really understood the breakdown of how my issues are all connected causing a snowball effect. What a relief to be somewhere where I'm not told to just loose weight, not told its all in my head or the classic ""must be women's issues"". I have struggled to live, exist really, for five very long years. For the first time I have hope that I can truly live a meaningful life again.|To: Dr. Ky and his staff, Thank you.
I have been a patient of Dr. Ky's for quite a long time, dealing with a severe spinal problem. From the very beginning, Dr. Ky has been a great doctor. His dedication to helping me has been unwavering, and I can't thank him enough. His staff is equally remarkable, diligently following Dr. Ky's guidance for my treatments. His staff are caring, kind, and positive people. Dr. Ky and his staff understand the pain their patients are in and work hard to help. To anyone in pain, I highly recommend you see Dr. Ky, no one else will offer you this level of care and relief. I rate Dr. Ky's private practice and surgical center a perfect 10 out of 10.  Thanks to his expertise, I'm out of the wheelchair and walking slowly, but I'm walking again. What he has done for me matters a lot and is important to me and my family.|I've been seeing Dr. Ky and Dr. Scott for the last eight years. Doctors are very knowledgeable and absolutely passionate and caring. There's a couple of negative reviews on here about phone service and appointment setting. I have to 100% disagree with both issues. Whenever I had an emergency or have to make an appointment change they're always willing to work with me if they're able. Honestly I don't know where I would be without Dr. Ky and Dr. Scott's help. They both work very hard because they're extremely busy and take the time to thoroughly explain everything. It can't be easy having to deal with a lot of people in pain and complaining but they do a fantastic job listening to us and helping us with all their knowledge. The whole entire staff is very friendly and always have treated me with the utmost respect. Also the place is always very clean and well maintained. Thank you to the entire staff for all your dedication and hard work.|I am a victim of several botched surgeries, and combined with a genetic condition, I suffer from excruciating pain every day. I cannot perform normal daily activities for myself or my children. Many doctors turned me away and denied trying with me. Dr. Keys is the only doctor that had hope for me and he saved me. He is the most patient, caring, knowledgeable doctor I've come across. His attitude, drive, and humor not only has allowed me to live, but has also made every step of this journey comfortable, safe, and enjoyable for me. His staff are amazing as well. I have a lot of respect for Dr. Keys as not only is he an astonishing doctor, he saved my life.|I am not a patient of Dr Ky's but I accompany my best friend to her appointments often.

Dr Mehta and his associates Dr. Furdick are great.  They have without exaggeration given me my life back.  I used to take a very large amount of morphine pills per month for chronic knee and back problems.  With the oral medication I was nearly bedridden.

However, with the pain pump from Dr Furdick implanted I am completely off all oral painkillers.

If you are looking for a pills pushing Dr. go somewhere else!  If you are looking to be pain-free you are in the correct place.

In a word, a mega-super employee of the center. I dream of having such an employee in my office. My doctor Mousavi is the best pain specialist in the world. He is very courteous, polite, sincerely sympathetic to patients, competent and most importantly humane! I sometimes talk to his other patients, they all respect him very much.

The staff is very nice, and respond whenever I call. I think they probably get sick of me calling but they are too professional to say so. Dr. Mousavi is the best doctor I have. He really tries to take care of his patients, and I am very sure of his ability to give me injections. They are all very nice, and Romeo is wonderful. He responds right away, and they have a lot of patients, so I am sure he is very busy. I think they are very responsive, professional and nice.
Dr Mousavi is an excellent doctor, and very kind. I am so glad that I came to his office. I feel they all give great care, and couldn't be nicer.|Dr Shabhazzian has always treated me with utmost respect and care, and his Physician Assistant, Jill Kremnitzer, is outstanding.

They work with me and my other doctors to keep my medication levels at a minimum while still performing the job as needed to keep my pain level under control.|I've been seeing Dr Mousavi and His staff for over one year now.  He is one good Dr. And man.

But most of all I remember a visitor who came to see me at Saddleback Hospital while I was
having cardiac procedures.  It was Dr. Mousavi!
It was winter and he was all bundled up for the

Unfortunately I have some permanent back issues, disc's & aging deterioration but the special injections that look scary but then aren't because...Dr. Zhao knows what he is doing, actually work. Neck injection today and I can turn my head again within 3 minutes. He's the best. Appointment times are reasonable and my insurance covers 97% of my treatments. And 1st floor is the nicest acupuncturist you'll meet.|Bad experience. We had an appointment and we arrived at time (we actually arrived 10mins earlier), then we waited more than a hour, and the nurse at front told us there are still two patients before us. What is the point I made an appointment ?! This was not the first time happened to us!! The worse time we waited was more than two hours. We waited in the front ,then when they called us, we went to another room for waiting. The Doctor we visited is only work on Thursday, but I think he handle more patience than he capable of so he can earn more. Btw the front desk was not than friendly when I asked how long I still need to wait. I am about to find another specialist, I can't waste half day in there every time I visit.|Highly recommend!  I've been to several pain management doctor's,  by far Dr. Zhao is the best.  He takes his time with you, listens!  He truly cares.  Since I have been seeing him, my pain has improved tremendously.   Best staff!|I have been a patient of this clinic for over 1 year, my low back pain is a lot better. I thank Dr. Zhao and his staff for helping me thru my recovery.  There are some days that you have to wait to see the doctor and your appointment time may be delay, but that is because Dr. Zhao takes his time with each patient and often performs urgent procedures, like he did on me on several occasions. He is a great doctor who cares and listen to all your complains.  I am so glad I found him and his team.

His office is very clean, and peaceful. The front desk very polite and professional. They do charge a fee for the use of credit card, but I did my research and it is legal, according to the California department of justice.

This doctor is definitely worth the drive and wait!|I have found almost complete relief from lower back pain with Dr. Zhao. I had two injections over a year ago, and I have had only occasional flare-ups. The no drug policy is so smart and so helpful. The doctor is wonderful as is the entire friendly staff. I highly recommend a visit to this center.|Been going there since last summer and I must say we have always been treated well. The doctors and the staff are very professional. Elizabeth and Stacey (girls at the front desk) are kind, welcoming and always greet us with a smile. Moreover, they have made a great difference in managing my back and leg pain for the past six months. Highly recommend Dr. Kim and Dr. Faruque.|Same person here from Yelp!

This pain center is a life saver. When I first came in, I had pain that felt like death to me... I was hopeless and didn't know how I could go on. I had my consultation with Dr. Faroque, then had the injection shot to my spine. My swelling was so bad that we were unable to get all the medicine inside, but the slight medication that went in did make a difference. From there, I went on to want to focus on acupuncture and physical therapy only. Dr. Kim who helped with my acupuncture therapy is amazing. She is very kind, and really cares for her patients (me). With Dr. Kim and the physical therapy team, my back is pretty much better. I still come by for my back stiffness here and there. I am really glad my Doctor recommended me. Thank you Dr. Faroque, Dr. Kim, the physical therapy team and to the nice front desk staff. Whoever is going through any pain, trust me I've been there. There is hope with Cali Headache and Pain center!|Excellent comprehensive care! From physical therapy, to cognitive therapy, bio-feedback, acupuncture, etc. Dr. Zhao takes time to write detailed notes. He knows me well, and my headaches have improved 85 to 90 percent. I used to have headaches 15 times a month or more. I am now down to maybe 2 a month. Thanks to medication, therapy, diet, a consistent sleep schedule, mediation, massage therapy, and hope.

She may be one of the kindest customer service representative I've ever encountered at any office ever.

As for the doctor..... I can not get one single word in. If I try to it's ""LET ME FINISH"" he talks one million miles a minute. I'm trying to explain what is causing the pain. He doesn't want to hear it. It's his way or no way. It's frustrating because I have an actual severe injury and I cant do daily routines or activities.

He is pushing a very unheard of amount of gabapentin on me so he can make my pain medication dose lower. My psychiatrist said it was an absurd amount. It makes you loopy and incoherent. He needs to learn some bedside manners, be a little more polite and be a little less egotistical. He doesn't want to hear what the patient has to say. I've been on the same medication for 5 years (gabapentin) and he just keeps upping it and I told him I wasn't comfortable with that. He doesn't care. I told him the results it gave me and it went in one ear and right out the other.

The weaning down of the pain medication he  Abruptly decided to do during the most painful time of my recovery. But he wouldn't let me speak so I couldn't get that out. I'm just going to have to call at the end of the month and tell him when I am out of my medication.

The last few appointments I've had, I leave the office or the phone call thinking about all the things I wanted to tell him throughout that appointment that he would not let me get a word out. (Which is crazy because I'm A very social and outgoing person) I think I'm going to have to look for a new pain management doctor unless he starts actually listening to the patient and what is wrong. Not pushing regiments on them that they aren't comfortable with and just aren't working? I like him but it's disappointing every time I have an appointment. My PT & Orthopedic Surgeon want to speak to him to get him on the same page of where I am at in recovery. It's still such early stages and the PT is only going to get worse at least before it gets better. I wish he would just listen to what I have to say. My PT has been trying to get a hold of him, he just won't speak to him.
Every appointment just feels extremely rushed.|The best experience to date. Upscale, upgraded and Super clean office with Staff super friendly and attentive. This is V.I.P  Service that I was not used to.  I have tried 3 different Pain Management office for Spine Epidural treatment and Dr.Taher Saifullah is the smoothest, quick and painless from all. I was surprised how fast, friendly, Skilled and Competent Dr. Taher was. This place might be the Best kept Secret in the Pain Management Industry- I highly recommend.|Very efficient office. Super professional always on time. Proactive managing the pain first then figuring out what caused it. The only group who could relieve the intense pain.|Entire staff are wonderful people. Dr. Saifullah listens as does everyone else. I feel so much better since beginning my journey with them.|Dr. Saifullah is a God send.  Been to about 4 other pain management doctors  what a waste of time that was.  So happy with this practice.  His staff are so sweet and helpful.|Dr. Saifullah has zero bedside manners coupled with a dismissive style ego towards his patients. His front staff make you feel like you are a second class citizen calling repeatedly before any appointment to remind you of your co pay over and over again. Dr. Saifullah is stoic, cold, dismissive, and doesn't like a lot of questions being asked. It's his way or the highway. Since he can't handle challenging patients he'll refer you out to other doctors not in your network at all. As a spine specialist with the same X-rays seen by him and USC, it was kinda obvious I had a TOS issue that needed to be addressed in my upper spine but he missed that entirely. Sadly, his ego, impatience, annoyance and cold demeanor makes him an insufferable character.|Dr. Saifullah is wonderful. You can tell he knows what he is doing and cares about you. I was really nervous when I first came in and he definitely made me feel more relaxed. I had a few epidural shots here for my sciatic and it had been a world of a difference.I'm able to workout much more and get back into HITT classes. The office is also so clean and the admin staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The back doctor I went to previously dismissed me and his staff was very rude. What a difference! Thank you so much.|Dr Saifullah and his team of staff have been incredible. The staff are kind, professional, and explain everything in detail. I truly feel like Dr Saifullah cares about my health outcomes and has made every effort to improve my pain and quality of life so that I can avoid/postpone surgery. He is incredibly attentive and knowledgeable, but is also a very sweet guy!

They canceled my appointment and was unable to give me an appointment until another month. When I stated I may have to find another doctor.  The staff communicated this to Dr. Lee.  So doctor Lee had the staff call me to tell me they will no longer accept me as a patient .  I'm done as well. I did find another doctor whom was very knowledgeable of the nerve pain I was experiencing after having my type of surgery.  The new doctor didn't prescribe all this medication Dr. Lee prescribed.

I had to wait almost 2 months for the initial appointment
When I met this doctor he right away told me he couldn't do anything for me because I had pain for too long and that I had seen too many doctors already, I had seen 2 , and one of them was treating me but I couldn't see the last doctor treating me because I had to move. I asked him to look at records from my previous doctor and he ignored me, wouldn't let me talk, he didn't even look at my MRIs
I told him it wasn't a good idea to continue with the appointment given the way he was conducting himself and he just repeated what I said and gave me a weird look, I walked out of the office
He walked in with a computer in hand and I was totally overwhelmed and disappointed with this approach

Lee is a miracle worker - He was able to treat my chronic pain which continued for over 1.5 years after shingles (postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)) through effective medication (non-opioid) and injections. I can enjoy life again.|Dr. Lee is a great and kind doctor, the injection that he recommended helped my pain. I used to be in chronic pain, but now this month I've only had two bad days which is a significant improvement compared to before. Again, thank you Dr. Lee!|WARNING! Please if you are thinking of neck injections from this doctor please DO NOT DO IT.  After the injection I started hearing buzzing, ringing, whooshing, hissing and humming in both ears and worst pain across the back of my head, neck and shoulders.  The ringing and humming is  24/7 for 1 year and 8 months now. It has really taken a toll on my health physically with no sleep for months! It's horrible! I've tried weekly massages, heat, cold and physical therapy to get some relief. Nothing helps! My quality of life is ruined by this doctor. PLEASE DON'T DO IT!!!
Dr .Lee will not admit something went/is wrong after the injection.
Horrible Doctor!|Rubbish from front office to Bryan X. Lee! The communication and professionalism are rudimentary.
Twice Bryan X. Lee diagnosed multiple issues while in office but when I got to the ""surgery center"" his treatment wasn't what had discussed at length in his office.

This office definitely milks insurance with unnecessary  appointments and insufficient treatment (ensuring to require additional appointments). If you feel the same and have IEHP please contact them.

Dr Lin is very knowledgeable and has installed a spinal cord stimulator implant upgrade which has been a game changer for me, I can move more without needing to bring the bulky and painful battery charger everywhere with me.  (painful to me because of how tight the charger had to be to read the battery).  This whole team is amazing|Dr. Lin and his staff are very professional and very helpful. Dr. Lin is very patient and has been the only Dr. that was able to diagnose me when literally 20+ Dr.'s couldn't figure out what my medical conditions were for years and years. Dr. Lin has been the only Dr. that took the time to figure out what was wrong with me and has my medical conditions stable, under control. I'll forever be grateful to him for taking the time to find out what my medical conditions were. Staff makes you feel welcomed and are super sweet. Thank you Dr. Lin and Staff!|Dr Lin and his associates are very dedicated and listen. I have been able to have the amnio fluid injections . They are incredible and there are no side affects. It's a bit different with cortisone injections. The relief is great but there are side affects. Dr Lin, Beth, Mike and others really listen and when it comes to injections in certain areas get it right every time. I really appreciate all that they do, their patience and input. They also have a wonderful staff of people go above and beyond to help with appointments, billing and getting the insurance to do what is necessary for coverage.
I am very pleased with this office and the fact that they are able to do visits in o e office and a few feet in another building do the injections etc..
I am grateful that they are always willing to help me out when I have an issue with an appointment time. They always find a way to accommodate and really help me out when I really need the help.
This office of doctors and all team members work very well together and are very respectful to the clients/patients. I am very thankful and happy that I have found Dr Lin. I am constantly improving physically, mentally and emotionally. Pain does a number on me emotionally and mentally besides physically. That's a major plus in my book to improve all 3. I have good and bad days line everyone else but to have a dr and staff that are always available to answer any questions, refill medication or schedule a procedure in always a pleasant and quick manner makes me feel even better.
Thank you Dr Linn, Dr Beth, Mike and staff. I am grateful and appreciate your help and patience so very much. Without you I would be down and out.
You won't be disappointed with this pain management office.
So very Thankful,

After just a few sessions, I noticed a significant improvement in my pain levels and overall mobility. It's such a relief to finally feel better and reclaim my daily activities!

I was scheduled with Amy for follow up and that went well but I don't particularly care to see PA's so my next visit was scheduled with Dr Brazil. He's very busy so my appt was 1.5 months out. I've called every week to see if there are any cancellations but none have been available. Finally able to get scheduled sooner with Dr Hodge (I'm hoping for the best). As far as the staff....no big issues. They have been very accommodating and helpful with scheduling and anything else. I may have had 1 incident where someone was rude but in 5 years I don't think that's a big deal. She could've been having a bad day, we all do once in a while. I have never had to wait longer than 15-20 minutes for my visits but there are others I have seen in the lobby waiting from the time I got there to the time I left....don't know why. Overall, I am happy with Dr Brazil's office. The office could use some updating but it is what it is! At least they may be getting their own surgery center in the same building. That will be a plus!|I followed Dr.Hodge over here when he joined the practice. Unfortunately he has long since left and it has never been the same. The support staff has always been severely under staffed. Which is overwhelming obvious. You better bring something to do when you go to your appointment you will wait for a long time!!! Then there's phone calls!  You will leave message after message..... to talk to the receptionist, to make an appointment, to see if they even got your message because they haven't gotten back to you in days, to order your prescription, to see if they got your message because they haven't gotten back to you in days, and so on. If you have to get a 'prior oth' plan to have back up medication . And make darn sure you answer ANY & ALL calls you receive from them. After speaking to someone in person, 11 separate phone calls, 2 voice mail (or 3). I was told by one of the back support staff ""Well I did call you back yesterday. You didn't pick up."". During the same call I was informed that they do not have an Office Manager. I have only met Dr a few times, he is very knowledgeable. The NP's are all so kind and personable. They (and not planning ahead) have kept me here. Not anymore. On to researching doctors|Horrible time management and communication. Dr Brazil has got to be the rudest Dr. I have ever met. Is consistently late with appointments and acts like its business as usual and you are supposed to like it. Unless you have nothing better to do than wait about 2hrs or more for him to get around to seeing you or even calling you this is your guy. If you like to be seen on time go somewhere else.|Always a pleasure knowing that I can always count on Dr Brazill or Dr Amy to Care for my issues, conditions, and mostly pain. They are honest, concerned, and very informative. I've been a patient 3 years at least and never had one issue. Heads up though, set your appointments and always be on time and don't forget, they are very popular hence very busy. As long as you're responsible and honest, and punctual you will never have an issue with them ever. Highly recommend them. No pressure, no discomfort, just you and a doctor and staff that's concerned about one thing only, safely and wisely managing your pain and conditions. Any doctor this good will be busy so be patient and get a referral.|Dr. Brazill and his PA Amy are always willing to listen. Sadly that may be part of the reason his appointments run so late. That has to do with the office stuff though. They must overbook. In the afternoon you have to wait 1.5 hours or more Dash that is the reason I took away one star. Otherwise they are a great place.|Horrible Medication refill place. Let my 98 year old grandmother run out of her pain meds for her back several times. Office doesn't return phone calls to living facilities to get refills taken care of. Even when she was seen for her refill the pharmacy never received the refill. This is unacceptable to have a 98 year old trying to live on her own and now has to go through severe withdrawals because someone didn't do their job. Her back is so bad she can barely get around, but tries her best.

There has to be better Doctors that care about a persons personal choices!!|I have been going to Pain Management for more than five years over that time. I realize that they're not there to manage Pain. They're just there to get you off of your medication a.k.a. pain pills I don't receive any pain medicine from Pacific pain well the reason why I decided to post was this is the second time they have set up injections for my back and when I called because they did not call me to set up the time they gave me the date, but they said somebody would call with the time no one called so I called Pain Management and they told me I was not scheduled again this is the second time this has happened. I just don't understand and nobody in the office seems to understand or refused to acknowledge. I spoke to them what is want to do. I am old enough to remember when we wanted to get rid of the middleman.|Profiling patients, refused to continue same pain management Pacific Northwest medical school pain management and research clinic. Left me with no referral and inadequate care for chronic pain from ankylosing spondylitis.|This clinic and other clinics they run outside of Santa Barbara is a huge waste of your time.  The doctors have seem to get their degrees online and most likely had an a.i. do their tests so they could pass.

My mom had an appointment and she was 10 minutes late because my nephew had to get to school by 8.  My mom got there and they said she missed her appointment and she would have to wait another month.  Not only is she not able to get her refills now, but now shes having to go through withdrawals without a doctors supervision.  The way they are treating her I am telling her to look into medical mal practice.|Great doctors, horrible patient care and office staff. Despite the good work of doctors I cannot recommend this office. If you are in pain, seek help elsewhere. You will spend hours on hold, months waiting for insurance approval, and likely be spoken to in uncomfortable or rude ways by office staff. This is not an anomaly, I have been going to this office and receiving procedures from these doctors for 2 years. I have excellent insurance. But on almost every occasion of needing a procedure the office staff has made mistakes so insurance wouldn't approve my procedures. In one case, they forgot to submit it completely. I would see the doctors and they would say ""ok schedule the rhizotomy"" and while I was in a pain scale of 7/10 the office staff took over 2 months on 2 occasions to figure out the approval. If you are living with pain and want relief-- this is not the place for you.|Hands down the worst medical treatment I have ever received. It would take hours to describe how horrible Dr Hullander and Dr. Pires are at caring for patients. Avoid them like the plague.
I believe they both think that they are great doctors, but they fall short. I believe they are not concerned with the patients needs but only his own personal agenda. And possibly the insurance company's and politicians agendas.  Nickname Dr.Crusader

Will you convert? No No No!|Most of the staff is friendly and helpful with an extra shout out to a few staff members who really go above and beyond, firstly Marissa at the front desk! She is unbelievably friendly and kind and will always help you with whatever you need. She is bubbly and has great energy!
Also Mary who takes care of prescriptions and stuff! She is always friendly and kind and ready to help you figure out what's happening with your Rx stuff. She is super awesome!

The doctors that I have met with are all really great and nice too.

The only problem that I have run into is follow through with some of the PAs not following through on getting your new Rx to your pharmacy in a timely manner. And they have problems communicating sometimes. Sometimes the arc that you end up getting is not the one that you discussed with them in person. Which leads to major complications with insurance and pharmacy stuff.
So the staff is 3 star average, with a select couple that are totally 5 stars! And the PAs get maybe 4 stars for kind and helpful with sub average follow through. The docs are great, so they get 5 stars!

Overall, it's a great place. And it's probably the best pain center I've been too yet. Which is saying a lot, because I've been to about 6 different ones now. Also, a ton of the patients that go through the pain center are horrible, crotchety, grumpy, and our mean. Or they are junkies looking for drugs. There are not that many patients that are kind and gentle and compassionate. So if you catch a staff member that's in a bad mood, it's totally likely that they have had to deal with horrible patients all day long. So give them a break if you can!|I am supposed to be at where Pacific Pain Management in Santa Barbara on Tuesday at 8:00 for where they due pain  surgery in Santa Barbara, does anyone know?",2024-12-31|2024-12-19|2024-09-12|2023-08-21|2021-12-14|2023-01-13|2022-02-16|2024-10-15,1|3|1|1|1|1|3|5,,,"11 a.m.|10 a.m.|9 a.m.",44.2|43.6|39.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking","(Translated by Google) I want to know if there are other forms of treatment other than injections for pain...

I wasn't there two weeks and recognized how conservative and inadequate my care would be and after my second visit (within two weeks) I had realized this was definitely NOT the pain management clinic that was actually interested in my true care. Dr. Sharon Leano started off nice and through on the first visit but on the second I had voiced my concerns approaching my 18th surgery and her post-op care (which was all I requested) (4-6 weeks)  about the Dr.s obvious direction of an alternative medication than what I had been using SUCCESSFULLY ( but now she wants to put her stamp on things and change it up) so now we're reinventing the wheel ?!?!?!
If it's not broke, why fix it ???
Needles to say this Dr. Dr. S. Leano instead, when as a patient just voiced my concern about the medication choice or direction she was leading to, she chose to be EXTREMELY RUDE, tell me ""Well we'll see how you do w the medication"" and I'm stumped thinking which medication ?!?!? But before I could gather my thoughts on what she said she chose to tell me basically ""goodbye"" and walked out of our appointment and proceeded across the hall to the next patient not even caring one bit that we were done or that I may have questions.  What DR. that actually CARES about your well being does this or acts like this ???
SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!!   My 17yo son recognizes she doesn't deserve to care for people. I'm an upstanding father of two extremely successful sons of 31 & 17 (honor role)  I've had two successful careers. One of professional rodeo cowboy (Bullrider) (hence the multiple surgeries) and carpenter (framer/concrete)   I'm 55 and healthy and still fit just had some lumps and bumps from ride'n and they've required surgery. This Dr. SUCKS. RUN. DO MOT WASTE YOU'RE ENERGY OR TIME LET ALONE ANY MONEY CUZ SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T DESERVE IT IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. IN JUST TWO VISITS SHE LABELED ME, JUDGED ME AND CATEGORIZED ME. THEN WOULD NOT ALLOW TO LISTEN TO MY CONCERNS ON MY MOST PAINFUL SURGERY TO DATE BEING MY 18th !!!!!! YA I KNOW A LITTLE. I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS. OH, AND SAME SURGEON BTW. I HONESTLY HOPE SHE READS THIS REVIEW AND IT SOURS HER. I HOPE SHE LASHES OUT ON ME TO SHOW HER TRUE COLORS CUZ THIS IS ONE OF THE DR.S THAT PLATS CONSERVATIVE CUZ SHES AFRAID OF GETTING FLAGGED BY THE DEA AND JUST GETS THE PAYCHECK AS A PAIN M DR.ITS SIMPLE TO HELP THE EDERLY W  OCCASIONAL  CONDITIONS BUT SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO'S EDUCATED AND UNDERSTANDS HOWTHE SYSTEM WORKS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR DR.S LIKE SHARON LEANO. AND FOR EVERY GOOD OR POSITIVE REVIEW.....I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS ONE.  THE GUY WHO TOOK THE TIME TO TELL YOU THE ACTUAL TRUTH AND HAS NOTHING TO GAIN OR PROFIT FROM. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I CANCELED  MY NEXT APPOINTMENT AND AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED I FEEL LUCKY I DODGED A HUGE BULLIT !!!!!

She is a very busy doctor but when she comes in to my room she is focused on me and asks lots of questions and gives suggestions on how to find joy in the midst of this hell that I call Lyme disease there is no cure and she does her best to make sure my pain is less. I'm grateful to her. After loosing my primary doctor of 15 years she is now the only one that I feel truly cares about her patients.|Dr. Leano provides consistently brilliant care.  She remembers to discuss all the important details with me in a comfortable, precise manner.  Most of all her personality is delightful.

Doctor Roofian is not just a pain management specialist that writes prescriptions without truly listening and assessing the medical issues.  He recommends natural approaches to permanent healing.  He doesn't start with high doses of medicine like most doctors.  He is not the type of doctor that will make negative comments to his patients regarding recovery.   He gives great long term recommendations for recovery vs masking the pain temporarily.  I arrange to have someone help me make the longer drive because he is worth it.
I truly believe I finally found a doctor that will help me transition to natural healing.  Although he does treat in all methods, he listens to what I want long term.

Before that couldn't get a referral for pain management where I moved. When I first saw Dr Gwalani it took almost 7 months to get a referral for medication management. Great in person but otherwise nothing gets done|Dr. Gwalani is so kind and understanding. He is on top of techniques for pain management and has helped me so much. The staff and surgery pre-op staff are top notch and I really appreciate them. This is the place to go. I was at my end with medical help and then I found Dr. Gwalani.|Just went to Doctor Gwalani. He did exactly what he said . I'm so scared of needles,  he said that I would be out and wouldn't feel a thing.
My neck has been hurting me for years , I had given up on getting any relief.  I truly hope getting this injection in my neck will a leave some of my pain.
So I'm giving this pain management treatment Facility a 10 out of 10.
Great staff and great care|If I could give 0 stars I would. I was a patient of Dr. Gwalani about 15 years ago(give or take). My current neurologist is trying to get records of the 2 epidural injections, the 1 facet joint injection and the EMG test he did; they will not fax it over to my current PCP or neurologist. They wouldn't even give me the physical results when I was a patient, the staff said I wasn't able to look at them or have any copies; which I found extremely weird as I've never had any issue getting a hard copy from any Dr. or specialist I've seen.

A huge issue was when I went I let Dr. Gwalani that I had a medical marijuana card and asked him if that would interfere with my urine screens for my meds, he said it wouldn't and I had/have no issue with stopping if my Dr. says so. Well when I had my urine screen it apparently was a problem and all my meds were taken away right there. When I asked about potential withdrawals, he said because of my age I wouldn't have any; that wasn't true. So I was kicked off of my meds for something he said was ok and when I went to make an appointment after that, the staff said, ""do you still want to see him since he isn't writing you controlled?"". Like I was there for controlled substances, I was there for my pain(with my PCP's referral)and the amount of injections he did proves it(like 6).

My favorite shady thing he did was he once prescribed me Xanax. When I told him I didn't need the refill he gave me and didn't finish the prescription; he asked if I still had them and if he could, ""have them to give to some patient who is poor and can't afford them"", word for word. I of course gave him them since he was my Dr. and I thought he was being sincere, I only thought it was strange after the appointment when I was in my car. Now I know thats strange and would never do that.

When I saw him I was 22-23 and I really think he judged me with my age looking back. I didn't ask nor want back problems at a young age, but I did/do and expect not to be treated like I'm faking, especially when I have the MRI's(and reports, all info)to prove otherwise and jump through all of their hoops.

If you can, save yourself the trouble and grief, and go to another pain mgmt Dr.; if you have to see him, I hope he has done a self reflection and has changed how he treats others and Dr.'s. As many people have said he has good bedside manner, everytime I met with him he treated me as I was a hassle, lying and just wasting his time; though he had all my reports from the tests I did prior, the new ones and the ones he had me repeat(""because there's no way that's right!"", it was).

Save yourself the hassle, please.|I had low back pain and leg pain caused by degenerative disc disease for years.  I was advised to have back surgery. After back surgery by a neurosurgeon my low back and leg pain continued and I was not able to walk properly and had limp.  After several procedures, the last procedure Dr .Jaimish Gwalani  performed did the job.  It did take time but being patient and understanding paid off.  Dr. Gwalani was able to relieve the horrendous amount of pain that was of an astronomical dimension.  Of course I do have residual low back and leg pain now and then but it is a lot less than before.  I can walk properly without a limp and without a walker or cane and I can even dance.

I had an appt. I now have a new ins.medicare they do not require me to have referrals, but a Dr. Order my medicare carrier DOSE NOT! do referrals & Said you find your own specialist When I called inland pain specialist the recpst  said I need a referral. I assured her I did not I needed an order. She said OK please get an order from the doctor saying that I needed to see a pain management specialist that was all she said so I got the order. When I came to my appt head recpst ask if it was for their facility I said I don't know she said it had to be for the facility. I said you did not tell me that or I would have got it for your facility. I had to try to get a Order correctly done and faxed to them so I could see the Dr that day which was not able to be done because My primary Dr staff was out to lunch & I did not get the order in time I had another appt that day to get my car fixed
I never seen the Dr & I had to leave for my other appt The recpt proceeded to a short-lived disagreement about the referral process again she said I need it I said I don't my carrier Does not do referrals it is an order I have to have from the Dr She did finally leave it. I am a believer of a person may be having a bad day that could be reason for the attitude they have so I never judge, but I can tell you That the head recpst Had a very rude attitude towards me and ignored me when I am positive she seen me waiting to be helped. I thought she is busy at the moment didn't interrupt. I stood there for approx 5 min I know she seen me she looked up at an Already established patient and smiled at them. She did this to a few patients that had come in, but to me she had a very rude attitude. I do not know why. I tried to be very polite and kind as I believe that is the way the Lord would like me to be treat others as you would like to be treated. I am not singling her out the other recpst that was there was very polite and pleasant she  answered my questions and addressed me in a very professional manner she was a younger woman they head receptionist was an older woman. So I could actually not tell you how good of a Dr he was  I never got to see him due to the negligence of the head recpst guidance in what I need to do in order to be seen by the facility I really need to have seen a pain specialist Dr this month due to I could not use my Previous pain specialist due to ins change, not under my control this facility was the only facility that had an appt this month and I was grateful to find it. I really could have used a consultation and got back on the road to getting injections in my back which I desperately need and one day will require me to have surgery due To the issues I have that will not get better without surgery. Surgery only manages it and lightens the pain that I have but the pain will never go away. The quality and productivity of my life depends on going to pain management. For the rest of my life had this receptionist guided me with the proper instructions on what I needed to see the Dr then I would have seen the pain specialist that day because of her negligence and her attitude of I did nothing wrong but this is your problem lady not caring. I never got to see the doctor and she was not helpful in anyway. Again, I remind you, she was very pleasant to already establish patient. Her attitude was very rude , disregarding & ignoring me
I usually do not Usually give bad reviews, Even when I've had a slightly bad experience due to the fact that maybe somebody is having a bad day but I feel in this experience that I should let this be known for the simple reason that maybe this person to be aware of their actions so hopefully they will change for the benefit of the Dr practice & the benefit of helping the patient, which is the reason the Dr has the practice is to help the patients This did not happen in my case
The Head recpst  had a very bad bed side manner i'm not sure why in my case why this has happened I do try to be polite and kind|When I first started coming here I didn't have to pay my IEPH/Medical cover my visit and medicine nonetheless the last time I went for my appointment they told me I have to pay $30 dollars that was in 2023 I didn't receive a notice or update before my appointment telling me I would have to pay a fee to see the doctor and for office visit I stop going there. that is so so wrong they want me to pay while charging my IEHP/Medical WOW|Excellent overall,I would just say to everyone leaving angry reviews & to new patients to not end up frustrated.
Get a referral in writing (Don't fax)

If you get a new prescription,ask them to check if the pharmacy has it or better yet talk to pharmacy 1st, because if they don't have it you might have to go see Dr again to get new script,I understand there are very strict rules & don't blame the Dr or staff,even if it might seem like they are unhelpful, just try to be aware of that & this is best Dr who reminds me of patch adams,he made me laugh despite being in tears from pain & female Dr is super nice & made me feel cared about!
Staff is kind too.

I would advise you send an email to them which seems faster,& never get frustrated with the receptionist who I'm sure is tired of addicts calling angry amongst non addict calls(just wait to talk to Dr in person or email,who is only person who can do anything basically),understand her job is hard,she is very kind if you are respectful & also apologize if you are at ALL rude even by accident ,like I did.

Ppl need to understand they deal with all manner of ppl & have a hard job. I regretted not just accepting when receptionist said I had to see dr again to fix problem(because I was worried I'd have to wait a week/month without meds)I see now I should've just drove the next day to see Dr, because it's hard to fix prescription issues over phone.(don't argue,rules are rules)
(I know it's hard when you are in pain,but don't listen to haters who expect unrealistic things)

Only difference from this Doc & patch Adams is,this docs sense of humor is much funnier,he made me feel like I was important,& he is VERY personable & likeable like you've known him for yrs. 10/10|Dr Katibi is nothing short of Awesome!! He is extremely kind, caring and makes you feel as though you are his only patient! Although flooded with many patients,  he never forgets to address each and every medical issue during every visit-I highly recommend Dr kakibi, and his staff!
C Ramirez|Please let me say: the Doctor may be good, however, they are negligent when it comes to causing patients to be 2 to 3 weeks late on their medications. There will be a civil suit following this practice due to negligence. They have been sent texts, voicemails, phone calls etc...still no results, they have caused their patients to end up in more pain and going to the ER.....negligence at their fullest!!!!|I have been going there for 2 years. Last week I went back to get a refill. Filled out the form and paid the 60 like always. Then a front office lady called me up and asked if I was here for a refill. I said yes. She told me that they'll call it in and thati didn't need to see the dr. So I left and later on called the pharmacy and they nothing was called in. I called the office and pharmacy on Wed, Thursday, and Friday and nothing. I decided to go down to the office first thing Monday morning. They tried to charge me another 60 which why do I need to pay when I didn't actually do an office visit?!? Another lady came in right after me and something happened to her. The office manager, atleast I'm assuming is the office manager is giving us both a hard time and being very rude. We just wanted our prescriptions refilled. I feel like the are just taking advantage of people.|By far the best place in the High Desert. Dr listens with heart and compassion he is friendly and takes his time with his patients I've never felt rushed or not heard here and I love that. The woman up front are nice and quick and great at there jobs. Thank you all for the hard work and making a difference in so many of our lives that deal with pain.|I have been going here for over a year and they are the only doctors who have helped me. I have a lot of very serious health issues and these people are great. I really love the 2 receptionists at the front. They have a hard job because people come in and yell at them constantly, but they just calmly take care of the situation. I really appreciate this place and the people here so much.

Recently when my medication was back ordered he refused to replace it with an equivalent amount or with something with only slightly higher dosage. He said I had to call around and find a place to divert the prescription to. I got in touch with five other pharmacies and no one had the. I informed the clinic of this but it changed nothing. He would rather that I had nothing while I wait for my prescription to come in. This is not medicine. This is sadism. Any other time this has happened with any other provider at this facility, they have provided me with an alternative prescription. He also has attempted to gaslight me at least once by claiming he told me things when he actually did not. I'm going to continue to go to this facility because I've been going there for years and they've been truly wonderful but if I run into anyone else like this person then I will consider taking my insurance elsewhere.|I would not recommend seeing dr REZA HE IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL AND HE GOES BASED OFF HOW U LOOK . He looked me up and down today and told me that he's not going to prescribe me any medication and said that my dr shouldn't have prescribed me anything. His tone is very bad when speaking to patients. I cried when I left that facility because I felt very much attacked . I'm African American and all the patients are mostly non colored ppl . I've been having extremely bad pain in my lower back and Spine and to tell me I'm not getting medication is very upsetting. My dr referred me to this facility if I was not needing this it wouldn't have gotten approved. I would like them to do an investigation on the doctors because that's not fair to the ones that really have chronic pain issues and they treat you like ur a dope fein needing a fix . It's very unprofessional .|I highly recommend Dr. Raza he is a wonderful pain management advocate. He is compassionate, kind and a great listener. I always feel welcomed  and he never rushes me. Also I am hard of hearing and he always goes out of his way to communicate in a manner that I can best understand , which is such a relief for those of us who struggle to hear . His friendly demeanor is refreshing and I always look forward  to my monthly appointment with him. Plus the front staff at this Howe ave location are so helpful and patient. If you are looking for a new pain management provider I highly recommend Dr. Raza.|I had sexual encounter in the parking lot when one of the providers didn't want to refill my prescription. He definitely took care of my pain. I will be back for more! So, he took me to his car on his lunch. Loving the parking lot activities|I have been a patient of APDSS for over 7 years. I have always been with complete respect and
total attention by all of the staff! I can see that
there a few minor issues that I feel could be
corrected very easily. There should be a simple
way to contact the doctor or PA that is or will be
treating you. Now all that you can do is call a
number and ask for the department that can
best help you, which in many instances they're
not able or allowed to. Most of the time who
ever you are talking to has never seen you or
even knows your name. I feel that thru no
fault of the company they are badly understaffed. From what I have learned there
is, at this time, a great shortage of pain doctors
and APDSS is no exception. I could probably
write another 1000 words or more about this
but I probably wouldn't find to many readers.
What I can do is just tell you that if you need
to find a pain doctor you will be completely
satisfied with your results from APDSS.|Inside of the facility is nice. However, the receptionists have attitudes, I see how they look at the patients. My 1st visit was good with Dr.Todd. he was nice and compassionate. He left the Howe Avenue location.
I received my 1st neck injection.
It was a HORRIBLE experience. I didn't know who was my doctor. The injection site was not numb. Vitals were not monitored. I am laying face down and looking at legs and feet. It was painful!!! I yelled and my leg kicked up from the injection. I felt everything!!!

I canceled my appointment tomorrow with HADDADAN. I am going to Rocklin for treatment. I was not treated with care or respect. He needs to investigated. The whole clinic does! He will NEVER touch me again. Patients in the lobby were telling me about rude doctors and assistants, their experiences and also one Patient said if I felt the neck injection pain imagine the low back. She  said she was screaming and still wasn't treated with care. This is NOT ok|I have been a patient @ advance pain diagnostics for 4 years throughout have encountered many employees, Dr.'s, and MA'S.
Today was a very pleasant experience @ the clinic.
Today started off not so well for me and my attitude was bitter and gloomy , then throw in my chronic pain and yeah we all now how that goes, smh.
To my suprise a fairly new MA had called out my name to take my vitals. An MA by the name of Marwa helped me. Marwa apparently has only been an employee here for the last 5 months. Marwa was intentive to my needs very patient & kind. I had a wonderful experience, she was a very proficienct  professional.
Please if possible as she was so nice and changed my gloomy mood to a happy one. I would like it if Miss Marwa could recieve some kind of recognition for her kindness along with her excellent work performance please. We need many more workers with her kind of drive and positive reenforcement. She met my needs not only physically but also mentally and emotionally. I have never ever encountered such a person. Marwa is going to go far within the medical field.

Money, doctors get a huge kickback per test, as much $3000 per test. Testing is done mainly to protect the doctor, insurance companies and the fake opioid epidemic, mainly fake in regards to prescription medications (The CDC even combined OTC medication to create that highly exaggerated number, which is still way fewer deaths than alcohol and cigarettes). Very few pain patients sell their medication, about .0000001%. Sadly drug testing methods, especially those used by pain doctors have extremely high false positives. Many doctors do not know how to read these tests and will throw out a patient for a false negative too. If one is taking street drugs why does that disqualify them for pain management? Addicts do not have pain? If taking street drugs that means they have access to illicit fentanyl, so why put them in a position to take more dangerous drug (if cut). Prescribed fentanyl is extremely safe, and by itself is almost impossible to overdose from.",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJU_qXJVjamoARjGW1XRiEMRY,86

I'm past due for a treatment I've been getting with them every 3 months for years and have been struggling to get care only to be told today ""we're no longer providing it"" so all of the hoops they've been making me jump through to get my treatment were for nothing. They gave me no warning that these changes were coming and led me along as if I would continue to get care if I kept trying. People come here because they are in pain. To continually mislead patients who are in pain and give them false hope is shameful. Then they billed me for the appointment where they mislead me into believing I would receive care. They have no plan to help patients continue care other than to tell me to find a neurologist who might offer these services knowing all neurologists have a waiting list of at least 6 months.

They made me feel very comfortable and made sure to take care of all my necessary medical needs. Great service. Highly recommend.|Making an appointment not so easy.  Left a few messages and got a call back two weeks later.  The appointment was with Jonathan, very efficient, Marie I believe was the nurse who covered the first time patient info,, very thorough.  Jonathan was great, answered many questions, thought the greatest problem I am having now is with my hip, he did some maneuvering of my leg and indicated it was a pinched nerve!  Answered even more of my questions and suggested a cortisone injection...have balked at those but he provided the 'method' of which they follow as well as suggesting a more recent MRI.  Went back for the review with Olivia, there are some rather difficult 'bulges' on lower vertebrae but advised to 'try' the injection to help with the pain.  I go back in a couple of weeks for that proceedure, you can not imagine how much I am hoping it will work....my restrictions are getting worse, walking is a problem, pain is constant.  So let's hope this works, trusting them!!|The people were great. The office staff was very receptive. And the provider I saw was very informative. What I don't appreciate is being told to be there 15 minutes early. Then I waited 30 minutes. By the time I left, I had been there over an hour, which ended up costing me Over $7 to pay for parking.|When I was seen at my appointment everyone was very professional and friendly. They examined my range of motion on my injured body joints. During the examination I didn't feel any pain or discomfort. But that night I started to feel pain and it got worse throughout the night. I was in severe pain and stiff. My pain level was 10+ to the point I could lie down to sleep. I called during office hours and spoke to the person that answered the phone. I let her know I was in severe pain and I wanted to speak to someone that could help me. She transferred me to someone that could help me. Once the transfer was complete and the phone rang, I got the voicemail and it said to leave a message and they would get back to me on the same day. I left a message letting them know in the severe a was experiencing. I NEVER GOT A CALL BACK! About three weeks later I get a call from them. The call was to schedule my procedure. I never got a call regard the message I left them. Do you think I would schedule a procedure with that office after the way I was neglected? No! I lost all faith in them. I wish I could have given them zero stars.|I was having severe hip and knee pain. I called Dr. Tatevossian's office and explained my situation and how miserable I was feeling. The office staff in Glendale were extremely kind and understanding and spoke to the doctor. I was able to be seen the same day with a little bit of a wait which I did not mind at all. I was assessed by Dr. Tatevossian and received cortisone injections and anti-inflammatory medication and my pain was relieved over time. Dr. Tatevossian treated me 5 years ago for pain in the opposite hip which helped tide me over until I was able to have surgery. He has always treated me with compassion and respect. I am forever grateful to him.|Professional staff, caring, clean and equipped with the latest technology, it was done so quickly and correctly, the next day I received a call asking how I was feeling, I am grateful to you, I feel very good. Thank you DR Tadevosyan|The support staff that handles communication with ""current"" patients say that they are short staffed according to scheduler Stephanie Contreras.
However, if you call and pretend to be a NEW PATIENT,  you get a live human when you call and press 3.
When they find out you are a current patient trying to get help, they get mad.
It's almost as if new patient calls are more important than established patients are.
Stephanie Contreras also takes approximately 10 days to manage any message we leave if she ever calls back at all when the question is urgent.
If, or when she does eventually call back, she blames the neglect on short staffing, then gaslights and downplays the broken communication issue.
She also told me that I needed to have extremely painful procedures ""in the office"" (rather than the surgical center) without IV sedation because she said my insurance REFUSED to pay for the surgical center.
She had zero empathy when telling me this falsehood.
Turns out that my insurance DID pay for it.
Tatevossian billed for the surgical center the day after my procedure and my insurance paid it 4 days later.
SHE LIED TO ME.
The stress I endured by being told my insurance refused to pay for the surgical center when Tatevossian billed upwards of $23,000 for it, and thinking that the amount would be an out of pocket cost to my family was immeasurable.
Furthermore, the last procedure I had with Dr. Tatevossian, (a Stellat Ganglion Block) on November 4, 2024, I woke up from sedation mid procedure and asked if we were done.
Someone put their hand over my mouth and told me not to talk as if their mishap was my fault.
It was horrible.
Were they trying to save money on sedation?
When I asked Dr. Tatevossian about it, he barked at me.
He pretended I needed to be awake for a procedure I needed to hold perfectly still for. Hence, the hand over my mouth and being told NOT TO TALK.
When I had a Cervical Epidural last May of 2024, without warning or any mention of what was coming, Dr. Tatevossian jabbed me in my upper back that felt like a hot poker ""before I was sedated"" and this caused me to tense up so much during the procedure that AFTER the procedure, I had such a stiff neck I could not turn my head right or left afterwards. I was terrified.
I wondered if I had chemical meningitis.
I called them for help and got voice mail AGAIN!
It took forever to get help.
Was this pre sedation jab yet another way to save money on sedation and also save money by not hiring staff who will answer the existing patient calls?
He is very hard to reach after a procedure in such emergencies.
Dr. Tatevossian was rude to me and he has hurt me during 2 of the 3 procedures I have had with him.
I believe that he may be running a mill at his surgical center and putting profits over people.
I left his practice not only because he doesn't seem to care about his patients concerns, feedback or communicating with them after they become established patients, but also because he hurt me and treated me like I wasn't supposed to bring it up.
He barked at me for it.
His focus is on the new patients, cutting corners to save money, and getting us in and out of the procedure room as quickly as possible so he can bill for it.
In my family's experience, this doctor has a big ego, and is over-rated. Added to everything else, he has terrible bed side manner.
As his patient, I am already in a great deal of pain.
The Tatevossian pain management medical practice imposed so much extra stress and frustration onto my family that any pain relief I received from a procedure was greatly overshadowed by a huge emotional cost. NOT WORTH IT.
I guess you can't know good, until you know bad.
I have a new pain management doctor whom I love. they answer their phones, value their patients, and would never downplay a concern.|For quite some Time, I've been dealing with lower back pain, and balance issues.
I was fortunate to have a Consultation with Dr. Andrew James Bach, who referred me
to Physical Therapy, with Prat Dhotre.

For several months I've been seeing Prat,
for regular sessions of Physical Therapy,
and I feel way much better than before,
minimizing the pain, thru specific exercises,
as well as improving my balance.

I am Grateful to both Dr. Bach, and Prat.

The Dr the whole time made me feel uncomfortable and out of place. They pushed PT on me and spinal injections, after I told her that I didn't want to do spinal injections.
Will never return or recommend this place to anyone. Worst care team.|OK, this is my experience going to Colorado pain clinic. Yes they was nice and everything else set. My problem was my primary doctor don't help out on my other medicine. I got to this clinic and it really felt like they was judging or it was like a discrimination whatever it is I felt really out of place, I got in there and talked to the doctor and told her about everything I have been through. I have been through so much stuff since I was eight years old from 8 I got hit by two cars from 2014 been carjacked and they literally almost killed me And 2024 on April 22. Apparently some lady who did not have insurance basically hit me and I lost control and I hit a tree head on. I broke my pelvic broke my first thing the doctors mouth was a stem procedure. I did my research on that, this lady never asked me about my medicine my current medicine nothing like that. She all prefer me to do the thing that would probably be best for you. I did my research on it. If you do your research on that stem apologist thing whatever they stick in your spine is not for me and I'm very upset and very unhappy. They never suggested nothing else. I left the clinic go to the counter to schedule another appointment. The lady said it's nothing in here and the system saying you got another appointment she said give me a minute she goes back and said the doctor said you never told her nothing, I don't understand if a person has been coming to your office. I think you need to schedule a appointment or talk to them about their previous medicine I think because I was black and they don't understand I'm American. I'm Choctaw. I don't know if color of my skin I definitely felt like I had a bad experience at this at this location whatever it is I don't know if they felt like I was lying except everything I have been through through my life and the pain I'm going through. I am very highly upset about how people treat you, they feel like you're lying feel like they don't understand what you're going through so they really wanna operate on me or make me as a guinea pig guinea pig I'm not I feel like you need to be more concerned and finding out who is your patient what they're going through and being more concerned as a person as a human being and as a patient and as a doctor, you need to know what a person is going through instead of judging or looking at what you see outside I'm leaving this message because I really don't do this. Leave these type of message messages on writing about places so I had a appointment. I missed it because I don't wanna go back here. I'm getting a whole new primary doctor as a patient and I'm going through just take time out get to know your patient get to know what they're going through what they have been through concerned that's the key being concerned and understanding what a person is going through. Makes a lot difference not just sitting up here looking at somebody so you treat one person want a different and you treat the other person like gold, I don't like that. I'm very unhappy about my experience being at this place I don't ever wanna come back here. This is my experience.|Everyone here is incredible, it is very obvious their number one priority is to the patient, the care is tailored to each individual. You are a person, not a number.

She hasn't offered to help me with any pain meds at all.
I have to take my muscle relaxers from my previous doctor.
She sent in muscle relaxers after I told her that I take from my previous surgeon & that she wouldn't prescribed me pain meds.
I have a slew of medical problems that they have records of h yet I'm still in pain.
All she's done for me was give me attitude & deny me..but yet what's to keep setting me up for needles constantly & isn't very helpful.
I should've stayed where I was at,.previously.
I came to this office to get treated & help with pain meds & all I've received was needles in my spine & told no..
I stopped going because I'm over being a pin cushion.
De. Moghim is a wonderful person tho, & so is the staff, but Jamie LeComte is somethelse & her attitude is beyond...
I'm in constant pain & deserve much better from this place|Loved my experience with Colorado Pain Care. Tried utilizing a pain care clinic a few years ago and did not find it helpful. My experience with Colorado Pain Care was the exact opposite.

My tech, Reuben, was very thorough, kind, and welcoming.

My provider, Jaime, was awesome. Extremely knowledgeable and informative, above all else she just genuinely seemed empathetic and focused on helping me find a solution to not continue living in constant pain.

I also wanted to give a shout out to Heather in billing. She was very communicative dealing with insurance and seemed happy to answer any questions as we tried to navigate the insurance process.

This facility has helped me stay out of pain!|Dr. Moghim is great never feel pain with my injections.  He has been a miracle worker and I am functioning now.  His staff is amazing too.|The staff is excellent, always a pleasure. Doc talks to you and treats you like you've know each other for a long time. Takes the time to explain and make's sure you understand. Answers all questions without rushing you out the door. You feel like you matter and not just a number. I highly recommend!!!|Poor Experience on all fronts.

Saw Dr. Moghim in May for info on peripheral nerve stimulator for my knee.  I seemed like a good candidate and he said someone from his office would call me with the cash price (the procedure is not covered by my insurance) for the procedure within a few days.  That never happened.  I called his office numerous times.  You can't get in touch with them.  Usually I am routed to a call center in Milwaukee , Wisconsin.  The people there say they will leave a note for Dr. Moghim's office staff to call me back with that quote.  Fast forward six months.  every month I get a bill in the mail.  I was not going to pay the bill until his office got back to me with the price.  In September I decided to pay the bill even though they still had not gotten back to me with a quote for the stimulator.

They still have not credited me for my payment.  I called the call center in Milwaukee and they said they have not received my check  I tild them I could email them a copy of the cleared check from my bank and they said that was not necessary.  That was aver a month ago.  So........today I get another email stating that I have an overdue balance and that I am subject to a 30% surcharge added to my bill.  Additionally, 6 months later and I still do not have a quote from his office on the cost of the stimulator.  They make it almost impossible to speak with someone in the their Denver office.  All of the options when you call eventually send you back to the same group in Milwaukee.  My experience with Dr. Moghim and his office has been very poor.|Front desk people were awesome as well as nurse who checked me in .... I'm paying out of pocket so obviously getting some help was important to me ...due to being perscribed a pain med in my past I felt like the doctor immediately looked at me a certain way(as the first thing she said when she came in the room was ""so you get hydrocodone"" even though I never once mentioned wanting any from them .despite noticing issues that would CAUSE PAIN I felt like I was rushed , treated poorly and overlooked.  It's honestly a shame that due to stringent regulation and societal issues I am treated as if I am not worth the empathy of the person I'm coming to for help . I was considering atleast going through with some of the treatment options but I'm having an internal battle as to weather I want to spend hard earned dollars with an establishment that treats patients how I was treated. Not very happy
My goal here is not to bash it's to hopefully get the doctor to see the error of her actions and interject some humanity back into her actions , fingers crossed

I saw the female doctor who's name started with an e , I wasn't seen by doctor robert however you guys are all one office correct ?

The doctor I saw named dr eleasa hulon

I was told it would be a few weeks to get started...that's fine, I understand it's a process and I wasn't in a rush. After 4 weeks of not hearing anything (their sheet says to call after 2 weeks if you don't hear anything), I called a couple of days ago left a message and no call back so I called again today. I end up on the phone with I believe an MA-didn't get a name but sure wish I had. She was shockingly rude. I was trying to explain, with upcoming travel and insurance change coming at the first of year how do we move forward a little faster. She said they need info from me. Some of that info was records from another practice. That practice did send the records and called to let me know they had. I'm starting to feel frustrated by her attitude at this point and ask as nicely as possible how come someone didn't let me know all this information was needed 4 weeks ago. Got excuses...understaffed, doing the best they can...valid excuses, but excuses none the less. Then she tells me I keep interrupting her and won't let her complete a sentence. Shocked, I asked ""are you serious?"" She was. Not surprisingly I felt exactly the same way - she'd interrupt before I could let her know I had records sent to them and why the urgency to move faster. There was no need for this to escalate the way it did. Common courtesy would have worked wonders. There are 2 sides to every story so I expect she's complaining about me on the other end. I'm not perfect but I didn't escalate until she did. I ended up telling her, never mind I won't be coming back. I'm not in enough pain to be willing to deal with this type of attitude. I will say the front desk, Cheryl, the gentleman who answers the phone and the PA I saw were wonderful!!! If you have thick skin this practice might be worth fighting through the rude ones. I won't know but hopefully they do help others with their pain.|In my experience with this office, there is a lack of empathy and understanding for patients' needs. After adhering to my advised treatment plan, the need to address a billing discrepancy in an amount over $400 arose. After presenting an account audit with all of my insurance explanation of benefits, they were able to correct the over billing. I assumed the problem was resolved and even referred a professional colleague. When I needed to schedule a follow-up appointment I expected support, but I was met with barriers and denied care. I was advised I would need a new referral from my PCP first. I ended up with other insurance and going to another clinic, but after a few years my insurance changed and I was re-referred back to Accelerated Recovery. When I called to schedule a re-entry appointment I was advised they would not see me as I had gone to another clinic, they were busy and that it was their policy that patients seen elsewhere were not able to return. While the providers I interacted with at Accelerated Recovery were competent, the overall professionalism of the practice fell short, leaving me feeling undervalued and unsupported as a patient.|The care is great from the docs and the nurse practitioner. Also the front office staff is wonderful. Never make you feel rushed, or it's a pain in the neck to answer your questions. In fact, I asked one of the front office employees if they went through customer service training. It's a pleasure to go to their office.
Pamela F.|I initially had a frustrating experience when they charged me $75 to sign my FMLA paperwork that I already completely filled out and all it needed was a signature. I asked during my appointment after paying a $50 copay. I ended up paying the $75 because I really needed the paperwork in order to protect my job. My pain has been unbearable and there are times I am unable to work because of it. I shared my frustration with my husband, who was also upset about being charged $75 for a signature. He then posted a negative review to about it. I called the next morning and requested a refund because my chiropractor agreed to sign my paperwork for free. They called me and cancelled my future appointment because apparently it is a ""liability"" for them to continue to treat me after receiving a bad review. But had it been a positive review there would not had been an issue. I wished I had look at some of negative reviews prior to scheduling any appointment here because I was completely unsatisfied with the lack of care I received and being treated as a dollar sign rather than patient. If you want quality care by a provider who genuinely cares about your pain, this is not the place to go!

Just want to add that it is NOT illegal to share your experience or frustration to anyone privately or on a public forum. That is called FREE SPEECH. Nothing I said in my initial review was inaccurate. I never said it was illegal to charge $75 on top of the copay, but it is wrong. Especially because another provider reviewed my FMLA Documentation and signed it with no charge. Sure, the Dept of Labor allows you to require payment, that doesn't mean it right to charge a patient $75 to sign a form that I already filled out for them to make it easier, on top of the $50 I paid that same day to been seen. That is my point this facility is choosing to charge patients a significant amount to sign an FLMA document on top of the copay. Just another way to squeeze money out of patients who are just seeking quality care for their pain. Their response should be enough. This place is so afraid of bad reviews that they would rather discharge patients instead of discussing the issue(s) with the patient.|Not to be dramatic but, I wish I could give Accelerated Recovery Specialists and the staff infinite stars!!

I have a very complicated case.  The providers that treated me were always kind, sincere, empathetic, and most important (to me) is the explanation of treatment plans.  Additionally, my questions were always answered. Always.  Even if the answer was ""it's not exactly clear"" the next sentence was how we can tease the issues apart to see what the ailment is stemming from.  Dr. Leggett always reassured me there are many tools in the toolbox that we can try and to not lose hope. I was near starstruck at the depth of knowledge of Dr. Leggett.
Any less than stellar review for the office seems to be a subjective misunderstanding of insurance plans or ineffective personal communication.
Elyse is an absolute rockstar as well as Ms. Cheryl and many many others.  If you're having trouble, ask clarifying questions and be patient with the process.|I was referred here and saw the PA. i was told they would call me for an injection after they checked with my insurance. they did not. i called after 10 days and they told me it takes a longtime to get precerted. ( my insurance doe not require precert)now over three weeks later nothing. if you are in pain this is not the place for you they will abandon you. I am a doctor (retired and i would not have sent my patients there if i were still practicing.So now i must consider other options.|Dr. Leggett's attention to detail and overall knowledge of back/nerve issues is quite frankly unmatched in COS. Would recommend starting here prior to doing pain management docs or surgeons. Wish I found him sooner in my back/leg nerve issues.|I have had medical procedures from Dr. Sparr in 2018 and now 2024.

We thought this place would be a good choice. At the first appointment, Dr Moghim complained about having to document so much for new patients. He claimed ""providers are running from the practice"" because of it and that it takes away from patient care. Isn't this a part of patient care? I would think that they would want to document as thoroughly as possible with all regulations they have to deal with. After he suggested a few interventional treatments, my husband made it very clear that he did not feel comfortable with anyone sticking something in his back. He continued to insist on it. My husband felt very uncomfortable at that time and did not want to go back but I talked him into a second chance. We went back in January and saw the NP, Hortense. After a short discussion about the procedure, she proceeded to express her concern over his last urine test. Somehow, his medications didn't show up. We were dumbfounded by it because he wears a weekly patch, which I change every week. She then said she would not prescribe his meds, which he was almost out of. I even told her that he's been on these meds since 2009. Coming off of them suddenly might be very dangerous. Nobody seemed to care. What I want to know is, why would you wait until January to tell someone this when you had the damn results in October. Oh I know- so they could get paid for another visit!! My husband was so upset knowing that he was going to be very sick without his medicine and he walked out. I sat for a moment but her nor the PA said ONE F'ING WORD!! I was shocked that they did not even try to say anything to stop him from leaving. This was their patient, who they cared sooo much about. Who they show sooo much compassion for. Of course, I followed after realizing they did not care or have any compassion for their upset patient. They were looking at him like he was some junkie seeking medication. He has suffered unimaginable pain since 2009 after a head on collision totally blew up his whole foot and ankle. He has been on these medications ever since. It really blows my mind that these providers don't take people's histories into account as they should. To just completely cut him off of everything was dangerous and, quite frankly, STUPID. I tried to call them to see if they could prescribe him something while he withdraws but of course, they never called me back. Surprise surprise. Totally unprofessional and ridiculous! News flash- labs DO come out wrong sometimes! No one can argue that point and if you do, you really need to bone up on your knowledge of lab practice. If you're looking for a new pain management provider, I would think hard before coming here! Btw, I am writing this review from the emergency room where he is being treated for severe withdrawal. Maybe I should send them the bill!!|I have been a patient for many years off/ on! They've always treated me so kind, with patience and compassion! I especially love Hortense and Dr Moghim! They are the best! I recommend this practice to everyone I know. In fact, we refer many of our patients to this practice as well and they all come back with nothing but the best compliments!|Probably the worst pain care clinic I have gone to in the last 15 years.  Their Castle Rock office has no MD's.  They have no place to do procedures....you have to go to Denver.  There is no follow up to the patient after treatment ( pain injections/ MRI results.  There is only a NP in Castle Rock as all other professionals leave and go to Denver office.  I would never refer a patient there!|Worst place I've ever been to it took me 7 months get in with the pain management place they gave me medicine and then said I had to do a new urinary analysis it's been over 25 days and I'm still waiting for the results to come back they give me attitude and treat me rude every time I call to figure out what's going on they also told me if I'm not a drug addict I shouldn't care right now how long it's taking which is very rude to say when you're in pain I came there for help never been treated worse Julie told me I shouldn't care how long it's taking if I'm not a drug addict which is very rude to say when you're in pain and came for help and they put you down and make you feel horrible|Hortense is a very caring, understanding and very knowledgeable.  She takes time to listen and tend to whatever issue I am having with my pain. Yasmine is a great medical assistant with a happy kind face to greet the patients. Tiffany is a fantastic receptionist always smiling and very courteous , it's great to walk in and be greeted by her. I highly recommend this awesome Castle Rock team to help you to get your life back on track if you suffer from Chronic Pain. You won't regret it!|Hortense is an amazing provider! She is always honest with her patients, and tells you what you need to hear in order to move forward in your treatment plan. This office is modern and beautiful, and the staff always makes me feel heard and helped. Would recommend!|I've been seeing Hortense Ngoe for about two years. She is friendly, patient, professional and caring. She is a pleasure to see and I believe she is truly looking out for my welfare.
As for the rest of the staff, they are friendly too.
Really important is that they are mostly on time as well.|I have been using Colorado Pain Care for several years now, my Doctor Ms Hortens has provided exceptional care. her expertise, attentiveness, and genuine concern for my well-being have made a significant positive impact, her ability to communicate effectively, listen attentively, and address my health concerns demonstrates a high level of professionalism, her commitment is truly commendable, creating a trusting and supportive relationship.

Every person I have interactions with from the front desk to the nurses and my Doctor has been absolutely amazing.  They saved my life. Dr Sharma is one of the kindest most understanding people I've ever met. This soul Illuminates every room he walks into and touches the hearts of those lucky enough to know him.|Possibly the worst pain clinic in Colorad0.  I quit going because its a shot mill and they run you through like cattle.  they have no concern about outcomes, if they injure you during a procedure you are on your own.  One time a patient came in an ambulance screaming in pain and he was basically told to shut up. He was in a gurney, unable to walk, and I knew that was my future if I kept going to UCHealth.  I simply quit going as it was very far to drive for zero care.  Edit:  I would never go back after my experience at UC. I don't use any of your offices at all now.  I never had a good experience. I was also misdiagnosed eventually, abused, and ignored as a patient.  My friend was called a drug seeker, and sent home and almost died, because they misdiagnosed her. You're a disgrace.|Was a pt of Dr. V... I complained of severed neck pain all I got was 1 shot of lidocaine and some xrays... didn't do anything to help. I received no follow up. When I messaged him a nurse messaged back gaslighting me saying it wasn't severe enough to come in... fast forward to now I have been seen at different clinic with new x-rays and even mris.. I havs 4 herniated discs in my neck that could have possibly gone away with some earlier intervention (like I tried desperately to get) now it requires fusion surgery. Don't go here,they're obviously too busy to give proper preventative care or truly listen to their pts... please go anywhere else!!|I have to say I have been living with a very painful condition for 14 years, I am rather use to the medical gaslighting but this clinic took it to another level, first appointment was video, no it was not COVID yet, Dr had good ideas, until I was booked for some tests. Then its the"" well let do shots"" he heard nothing of what I said and obviously knew nothing of my condition or he would not have suggested shots, Ok the "" Spinal cord Simulator""  Dude I just met you,on video????Really... Well OK I am going send over a formula for compounding, Yea OK OH $45 for a 2 week supply, do I look like I have that kind of money. So I wont/cant do any of theses things and they drop me, then has the God Damn nerve to tell my Primary that I am uncooperative, that includes all the doctors at this clinic that I saw. Gaslighting, no help at all just left me with sever depression and not a thing I can do about it. Edit: to the response, PATIENT REP IS JUST AS BAD AS THIS ORGANIZATION, THERE IS LITERATELY NO REASON TO CONTACT THEM THEM DO NOTHING.|First injection in tailbone was wonderful but lasted only 30 days. Follow-up injection caused severe pain that has lasted now for a month with little relief.  Dr. V did prescribe prednisone, but sent to wrong pharmacy. Communication with UCHealth in general has deteriorated drastically and prevents any real-time conversations.  Dr. V said he had no idea why the second injection went so horribly wrong and recommended a third injection which I refused.  Other than the prednisone which was finally sent to the correct pharmacy but did little good, there has been no follow-up, no helpful recommendations, no interest in my well-being. Very disappointing.|I have gotten pain from my migraines under control after many years of struggling and three brain surgeries (only worsened migraines) to stop my seizures. I also started receiving treatment in order to help my TMJ, and I am hopeful.|I've been diagnosed with CRPS and as a result I'm in pain 24/7 and cannot walk. I've had one injection so far and zero follow up. No treatment  plan other than physical therapy which I've had to wait for 6 weeks. With crps time is crucial as it progresses and spreads. They only offer injections and antidepressants. Not a lot of hope given and if you ask a doctor a question different nurses respond. I feel absolutely abandoned. I don't think they specialize in RSD or CRPS at all. I'm so frustrated. Expect a 4 day delay when asking questions.|My doctor ended up scheduling one type of procedure (three times) to work on finding a solution on managing my chronic pain issues. I was told that if that did not work for me, I would have a lot of other options to try. That changed during my last appointment, when I was told that my only option going forward right now is to do physical therapy (which I've already done twice) for MINIMAL pain relief that can take years. I was told great things about this facility and my high hopes have been crushed. I've been dealing with this pain for over six years, and when I finally thought I was getting somewhere, nothing.

My father had been complaining of severe lower back pain for two months, and nobody seemed to know how to help him. Everyone just continued to suggest physical therapy or acupuncture; mind you, my dad was 75 and had severe rheumatoid arthritis, so PT did more harm than good. When we arrived for his appointment here, we were greeted politely and only waited a few minutes before being taken to a room. Ms. Ariel was so sweet to my dad and really took the time to hear his concerns. She weighed the pros and cons of certain tests and imaging to see if we could get to the bottom of his pain. She saw something that others did not and referred him right away for imaging that showed my dad had tumors on his spine, eventually leading to more imaging where we discovered he had tumors throughout his entire body. The office went above and beyond to get us to the right people who could expedite his treatments. Dino took extra time to explain telehealth to my elderly dad and even helped us to know exactly what to say to other specialists when the medical conversations became quite confusing. This was an overwhelming time for my family. Unfortunately, my father passed away 3 months later; however, had we not discovered his cancer, we would not have had the time with him that we did. My family is forever grateful for Prism and their compassionate staff for helping us to navigate this unimaginable experience.|I've been a pain patient for over a decade, and have been to a couple of Pain Management clinics due to relocation and what not.  I'm also an healthcare provider, so ive been both recipient and provider of healthcare for most of my adult life.

Ariel is very professional.  She is always pleasant and provides compassionate care.  She is also highly knowledgeable about the condition she is treating.  I highly recommend her to anyone seeking treatment for any debilitating pain conditions.|This office and employees are aware of each individuals needs and by their actions and how they sync things into a plan for each of us patients, then all one must do is commit to their help!!!

But the reception is not they dont listen to paitients and what they are asking of. Ive had several issues with reception. In scheduling and trying to get prescription refills. And getting documents. There been times ive gone several days without prescriptions because of miss communication. One in particular is the older male receptionist there im not sure of his name. But he can be very rude. I think if it continues im just going to go to a different provider.|Dino, Dr. Shaffer and the whole team are amazing and very caring. They understand their patients and what they're going through.

CRNA Jeff Toups said he didn't treat my condition (which I didn't expect him to) but my condition causes severe chronic pain which is what I came to him for help with. Maybe he felt he couldn't help me because I already have a Rheumatologist and a primary care doctor who prescribed me pain medication. Primary doctor are limited on the amount of pain medication they can prescribe so I was hoping I could get help with a longer acting medication, I am horrible at speaking up and voicing my thoughts mostly because it's scary to be direct about what you need because you don't want to be labeled as a addict or drug seeker. I used to be on a long acting and short acting medication in the past before the government got involved in healthcare and my pain was well controlled. I've been on the same medication for over 10 years and have never ""lost or ran out of my medication early"" it's the only medication that works without side affects, again I've been on the same dose and medication for years so I do not get ""high"" what so ever.

I look forward to seeing them every visit because they treat me with kindness and respect.

Nurses -- I have the same review as the front staff, but you can tell they care and remember you, it's important to be remembered.

My Doctor -- Is just wonderful and it's hard to find a doctor that cares.... she cares and you can't put a price on that.|With most first encounters, your not sure what to expect and even after the first visit, I still wasn't sure. Now I am glad to have her as my provider and she understands me. Give her a shot and don't judge on your first visit. You're decision will be made up on the second and it will be positive.|I've been a patient here for about 2 years, maybe a little longer. I'm just really unhappy with my current care. I don't feel heard, valued, cared about. I feel like they are treating me like a textbook case, and I'm anything but. There is no textbook treatment for Scleroderma patients because there are NO 2 Scleroderma patients that are the same. I'm getting frustrated because when you call for a refill the 7 days or longer recommend in advance they still wait till the very last minute of the day it's due or the day before it's due to get sent in. It's also frustrating that they shut off the phone at 3 pm. Close at 330pm. And are closed on Fridays. There's also NO after-hours number or emergency number for hospitals, drs, pharmacists, surgeons, etc. For someone like me who has a terminal disease with no cure, it is very scary. I have random surgeries out of nowhere and constantly end up in the hospital for being super sick or flaring up. Having no immune system due to being on chemotherapy, i get super sick a lot, and hospital staff can hardly ever reach the providers. When I first started here, they were attentive, listened, and seemed to care. But it's been going downhill for months. Which is sad because I really did like it here. My conditions are ONLY going to get worse. They will never improve. I've been on pain meds since I was diagnosed at age 4. I'm now 39. I know my body better than anyone, and I know what works for me and what doesn't. I don't appreciate being treated like I don't know as much as them when it comes to my body and my diseases. 90% of primary care drs and ER Dr's have never even heard of my primary disease, Scleroderma. There are no experts in this disease. All you can do is just try to manage all the many, many different symptoms because there's no cure. I'm going to be a lifelong pain patient, so I just wish I was being treated better and with more respect and decency than I currently am. If you just need a short-term pain dr, then definitely consider this place. They aren't ""awful."" I just personally feel i could be doing better and be treated better.|Leah is the best pain management professional I have ever experienced! She is very knowledgeable about everything that I need and manages my pain through her hard work and dedication! Her team at Metamorphosis Pain Management is AMAZING!

Her office communication leaves a lot to be desired. When they get the refill line problems solved, it will be the perfect clinic. This is no reflection on Leah.|Literally the worst clinic in the Springs. After Apex abruptly closing and leaving its patients in the dark it is quite a feat to still do worse than them.

I received my reminder call on 11.20.24.

I was completely out of my pain medication on 11.22.24.
These clinics should not be allowed to pick and choose which patience they want to see, in which ones they don't want to see. If you are a pain management clinic that involves managing patience, pain, pill prescriptions, then you should not be allowed cancel anyone's appointments the day before they're appointment is scheduled.
They had my information from the referral for almost 3 weeks and decide to call me the day before my appointment with them and they knew I was going to be out of pain medication. The laws need to change that if any clinical pain management clinics schedule the patient an appointment. They cannot cancel the appointment for any reason. This would at least give patients who need their medication, not just want the medication, there's a difference.
I do not recommend going to them.You will get screwed too|I have been a patient of Brittany D'Orio for over four years.  She left the practice I was a client of and moved here.  The staff is superb!

Everyone there, including the front desk staff, treats me like family and I always look forward to my visits because they can actually be fun! They have been shoulders to cry on during tough times, and friends to laugh with during the good. I highly recommend this place and the doctors I listed above.|Dr's are all amazing.  Authorization department is a joke worst in the state. I had an appointment in January, I received approval from my insurance,  I sent it in the portal, left voice-mails, sent messages, went into the office. The Authorization expired.  I called my insurance,  I got an extension on the approval and to date still no communication and no willingness to schedule my procedures. I also need another injection,  went back in the office to the Dr 3 weeks ago and they have still not requested Authorization for the injection.  Good luck ever getting injection or procedures scheduled. I even asked for the office manager and was told no. This is unbelievable.|Dr. Pouliot has been my physician for years. He is the most caring, honest, and professional pain management physician I have ever had. I truly appreciate everything he has done for me and everything he continues to do for me. He focuses on reducing my pain without narcotics which I appreciate. Also, the staff is very welcoming and caring. Highly recommend him and this practice! They truly care about their patients!|Well the nurses were nice but doc was very short. The numbing meds didn't work. Bout a week after I started having an allergic reaction called in and staff really didn't seem to care the assistant didn't even pay attention to what I was saying when I explained what was going on. Then they still insisted I wait for the steroid to work. Well here I am 2 weeks post injection in worse pain than before sent an email. And go figure my follow up is still out a ways. Just over all frustrated with the whole process.|I have been seeing Dr. Poulliot for many many years now, and I will tell anybody that he is absolutely one of the most professional, friendliest, and smartest physicians I've ever had the pleasure of knowing or being a patient of. I have always felt like I have received the absolute best care in his practice,  I trust his judgment and that he always has my best interest in mind . His medical assistant Justina is one of the kindest people I've ever known; she is a true MVP here. I look forward to seeing her just as I would to visit a dear friend. She does her job incredibly well, she is always efficient and friendly. The front desk staff is also always very kind and professional as well. I know that I am in good hands here amongst the staff and the physician, and after working in the healthcare field for 20 years myself I've seen my fair share of ""not so good"". I would HIGHLY recommend Front Range Pain Medicine to anyone that is seeking professional, kind, and better than efficient care. I would say they are exceptional.!|I just got an epidural in my neck this morning and although I am not feeling the relief yet I wanted to say how professional all the employees were. They made me feel very comfortable and relaxed As this was the first time I was doing something like this. They also had a horrible Karen being incredibly rude and dramatic, which they handled the situation very well. Nurses and doctors need to get more credit for the stuff they have to deal with on a daily basis. Thank you all for an amazing experience and all you do for your patients. I'll see you again in six months.|I'd like to share my experience, I have had one fusion and two artificial disc replacements. I still continue to have severe neck and arm pain in both arms. Dr. Brown has done several injections and The other physicians assistant have been very helpful to treat my pain.

The front desk staff, is exceptional!
I called to get a claim number to contact my insurance, it only took a couple minutes. The front desk person immediately got what I was asking for!! very helpful!! Thank you!

I just seen all the other negative reviews, and I wanted to stand up for this amazing facility.
I highly recommend them. If you're looking for narcotics and not willing to try anything else, don't go there. Pills aren't always the answer.|Dr. Giradi is a brash, impolite doctor with no bedside manner. Guess he might have watched ""House MD"" and thought that's what compassion in medicine looks like.
I get that pain management has a lot of hazards I can't begin to understand, but to be without understanding of the patients pain or to assume they're just in there to get free dope is a bad way to approach medicine.",2024-08-14|2024-07-17|2023-08-02|2023-08-28|2023-04-28|2021-11-23|2020-11-10|2024-01-13,5|2|5|2|5|5|5|1,,,"2 p.m.|1 p.m.|3 p.m.",60.2|58.8|51,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ-7PtleWsbocRzDL9LJAu3xU,34

Jenny found out what meds I had to try first and Melissa helped get me through all of them. They kept submitting and appealing and, finally, it was approved. They stuck in there and advocated for me. I feel heard and believed and I know they have my best interests at heart. I'm grateful for their advocacy and I highly recommend their care. I'm very grateful. Not everyone in my care history has been as supportive, not even everyone in this practice. I've had some pretty negative experiences (none as bad as Blue Sky Neuro), but Jenny, Melissa and Dr. Krutsch are wonderful humans and excellent caregivers. If you don't get the response you're hoping for, see a different practitioner. Don't give up until you find someone who is willing to fight for you and listen to you. Even with in the same practice care can vary greatly.|My father (John Owen) is a patient at Colorado Pain and our family really appreciates everything that Dr. Krutsch and the other members of the medical staff do for him.

Everything was fine and dandy until they outsourced their billing and customer service this past year...
I have had a billing issues *since July of 2024* that no matter how I try to contact them, I cannot get help. No one returns my calls, not even the Office Manager for Lakewood. I have even walked in, crying my eyes out, begging Nicole and Lexi for help. Nothing.
***The amount of anxiety this situation has caused me is unreal.***
I have tried every month, multiple times a month to get them paid. I am waiting for them to send me to collections and start to ruin my credit.
Customer Service rep ""ROXANNE"" seems to be the main Gatekeeper and won't transfer my calls or let me leave voicemails for those involved that I need to contact. She ""sends an email"" that I NEVER get a reply from. Ever.

The staff here is absolutely amazing from Dr. Krutsch, Jamie Xiong, to my physical therapist Will, and the front staff. Everyone has been amazing helping me on my journey. Thank you for providing such optimum care. I would recommend Colorado Pain in Lakewood to anyone who is looking for prestige care.|I started coming here for Botox injections for migraines. I have had migraines most of my life, they were getting worse and I was getting almost every day. The first experience I had, I called and scheduled an appointment at the Lakewood office. I verified the location and address multiple times and made sure it was at the Lakewood office. I went in on the day and was told I scheduled it at the Denver location. When I said no I made sure it was the Lakewood location I was treated very rudely. So, I had to schedule another appointment weeks later. My first appointment was ok and Botox was ordered and I came back for the injections. Dr. Krutsch was great and the Botox worked wonders. For the first time in over 20 years I had no migraines. I was beyond excited and would rave about the office and the shots to everyone I knew!! However, that all changed! I had to change insurance and knowing the office would need the new insurance and specialty pharmacy information. I called my insurance and got everything they would need ahead of time. I called the office and gave all that information over the phone before my next appointment (1st time). When I got to the appointment I gave the girl at the front desk my new insurance information again and she made copies of the card for my file (note this is time 2). I went in to see Jamie Xiong and made sure to give her all of that information once again. I gave her the insurance information and all of the specialty pharmacy information so she could order the Botox (this is time 3). About a week after my appointment I got a message from the pharmacy that my prescription was not covered. So I reached out via the portal and left message after message trying to get someone to get back to me and got nothing. I called the office and left message after message asking someone to call me back and nothing. finally I get a call from the office manager weeks later and she tells me that the insurance they have is expired. I had to explain it all over again and once again gave my insurance information, specialty pharmacy information (time number 4). I did let her know that I have been calling and leaving message after message and get no call back, I told her how I have left message after message on the portal and nothing back. she assured me she would look into this and get it taken care of. Finally my prescription was sent to my pharmacy. But, it was the wrong pharmacy. I found out because I took the effort and called my pharmacy to find out what was going on and found out it was sent to the incorrect pharmacy. It was sent to the regular pharmacy and needed to go to the specialty pharmacy, which I knew and got that long before this. I once again called the office and gave them the information of where to send it to. I never got a call but they did finally send it to the right pharmacy. However they didn't send the correct information and it was denied. I had to reach out to the pharmacy to find out why. I then called the office back and told them why it was denied and what they needed to send for it to be covered. Finally they got it right and it was approve.  Through all of this I got no phone call back from anyone besides that one call from the office manager.
After fighting and making phone call after phone call I have the approval and I get it sent to the clinic. My Botox gets delivered to the office and I get the call letting me know that I can now schedule my appointment. I get the appointment scheduled and about an hour or so later I get a call back and she tells me that my insurance is not active. At this point I'm pretty upset. So I once again give her all the information for my insurance, this is now the 5th time I have given this to the office. When I express my frustration of having to give my information over and over and over again I'm met with rudeness. When I express my frustration about not getting one call back I'm met with rudeness. I understand there are patients being seen and helped during the day but a quick phone call during down time is not that hard.|Dr. Krutsch, Dr. Moghim and the entire team at CO Pain Care have gone above and beyond for me. My insurance didn't approve an RFA last year because it was too early. I desperately needed it because I had to dance with my son at his wedding! The entire team worked it out with my insurance so I had the RFA 2 days before we left. Dr. Krutsch also does Myobloc injections for my cervical dystonia, even though he wasn't familiar with the drug before I told him about it.

Negative stars given!!!!!!

Denver Diagnostic Pain seems to only care about money. I have tried to make an appointment for months now and left several messages. They never answer the phone, they never follow up.

This office charged over $1000 just to be seen for pain meds, and refused to take insurance on an open case with an attorney, even though we were trying to close the case.

It has been months of being in pain and that doesn't matter to them. When Dr. Rentz came in, it was all of five minutes he was there, with a very arrogant attitude and rushing through.

I do not recommend this office!|I'm still waiting to see if this was worth a visit.  So far I don't have a good impression.  The MA was far better than the doctor himself and I didn't appreciate the fact that I made an appointment with one doctor specifically and was switched to another without any warning.  I would have cancelled the appointment had I known.  I drove an hour for this appointment and it was mostly a waste of time.

Edit:  Reduced rating to one star a week after visit.  They were supposed to send a prescription to my pharmacy and an image request and no one at the office did anything as a follow-up to my appointment.  So I was rushed through my appointment and the appointment resulted in nothing, not even the office following up with what they said they were going to do.  Don't waste your time here, it's just a money drain for nothing.  The doctor made it downstairs before me after my appointment so I'm wondering if he never gave my chart to his team to follow-up on.|If I could give a negative # review, I would have. All about the Almighty $ and throw in disgusting customer service. Don't wait over a month to tell patient insurance denied, when waiting on a surgical procedure you were counting on in 2 weeks.  Never, ever again!|If you are looking for a five star experience you should visit Dr. Jack Rentz and his team. They are amazing! I can not say enough wonderful things about the care I received at this office. I have been in pain for some time and Dr. Rentz is the first doctor that could help me find answers. Dr. Rentz is extremely knowledgeable and kind. He showed me models so I could visualize what could be causing my pain. He listened and took time to fully understand my condition. He put me at ease about getting surgery. He has amazing surgical abilities and exudes confidence in his line of work. The office locations are extremely clean and up to date. The front office staff is always friendly, organized and on time. They are extremely helpful in helping me understand my insurance information for each procedure and making sure my procedures are covered under my insurance plan. Every provider I have seen at this office goes above and beyond. They truly care about their patients. If you are in pain and looking for answers you should book a consult with Dr. Rentz. Thank you Dr. Rentz and team!!!! You guys are truly fabulous!!!!!|I love Dr Rentz and his staff! He always takes his time and listens! He explains things thoroughly. He and his staff are great!! And Sarah, my PA is so amazing! She listens to everything and isn't rushed. I appreciate the great care I receive from Dr Rentz, Sarah and The wonderful receptionist who gets things done!! Thank y'all!|Mo the receptionist made me feel welcome and my being there was important.  The care coordinator was very attentive and genuinely seem to care about my situation and finding the right plan for my wellness and recovery.  I would recommend Denver Diagnostic Pain Clinic over any other.  Thank you,  -Aaron S.|I love this place! They actually listen to you, spend time with you, and actively help you.
I see both Dr Rentz and Sara, PA, and both are amazing and kind.

Most of the front desk is amazing, fun to chat with and so great to work with! If you can avoid dealing with Mo (Moe?), you'll have the best customer service ever.

Highly recommend!|I really like their physician assistant.  The issue I have with this practice is the billing and scheduling.  They are very busy so you have to book to hold a place on the list (not my complaint).  However the last two times I have scheduled procedures I have found out just the day before what my out of pocket will be.  For those of us with these huge deductible plans and changing companies annually it is hard to know what a cost will be through their particular facility.  So when you learn the day before that you will owe several thousand and decide against that financial drain and to just live with the pai , they still charge you a fee.  It is just unfortunate...plus you are still in pain.  You feel ripped off by your health insurance,  sad about your broken body, and frustrated having to pay a fee when you know your appointment slot was easily back filled from the long list of other people wanting or needing these injections and rhyzotomies.",2025-01-01|2024-09-25|2024-01-19|2020-09-02|2020-06-25|2021-12-16|2019-04-22|2022-03-20,1|1|1|5|5|5|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Does this office provide a D.O on staff?","I'm not sure.

I have never heard of a doctor taking that much interest in helping a patient. He and his fellow, Ricardo,  are both very kind and very knowledgeable. And they have a great sense of humor.

Dr. Meyer is spot-on good and has shown me that he cares about his patients. I have also observed the care he personally gave to other patients, some with special needs, and believe he is a truly capable, competent, and compassionate professional physician.|Dr  Meyers made great first impression. Then complete lack of care afterwards. My mother was experiencing incapacitating back spasms for 6 days and office did not respond to calls (actually pleas for help). I don't actually know if Dr Meyer ever received the messages we left.  Contacted office manager who made excuses and was condescending. ZERO compassion or care. My mom's very compassionate orthopedic surgeon & PCP are not equipped to manage her pain any longer. The ER tried and failed to help her. Feels like the priority at this practice is on doing procedures and not in helping an elderly patient in desperate pain.  We were so hopeful but let down. I suggest Dr Meyer and staff review his Philosophy of Care that is posted on their site.|I can't describe how wonderful it is to be seen and heard by your physician, especially a pain specialist. Dr Meyer and his PA David have always  taken their time with me and shown great compassion and care.
Dr Meyer is helpful in trying to find just what's right for my pain management needs.
I never mind having to wait a bit because I know he is giving the same great care to all his patients as he does me.
His office staff are friendly and kind and have done their best to get me in when needed. It's obvious they are happy working in this office and with their doctors.|Worst doctors office EVER, do not go here. You can't get a straight answer, your constantly trying to get answers and NO ONE responds. I was even willing to make and pay for a doctor appointment and was denied. Another note..... I WAS NOT LOOKING for opioids. I went in trying to find a doctor to implant a Spinal Cord Stimulator, Dr Meyer told me he did not implant them but had a doctor that does. Ok, that didn't bother me. He obviously lied, my procedure was approved by my insurance company in Oct. Well it's Dec and still no doctor. Don't waste your time. They don't care about you or your health issues. Fund someone who cares.|I'm not sure the pain injections are going to work based on my prognosis but I'm glad I'm trying it before going down the surgery road.  I disagree wholeheartedly about the reviewers that have issues with the staff.  My experience has been nothing but professional, friendly, willing to explain everything and compassion.  I've only been in twice but have been in phone conversations several times besides my appointments and again, everyone is very nice and respectful of my situation and truly want to help.  Dr. Meyer is amazing.  My first injection was under sedation but my second was not and he walked me through every step and was cracking jokes with his staff that made me laugh and be at ease.  Every time I felt pain he would say with sincerity ""i'm sorry"" and that made me feel better.  I highly recommend Dr. Meyer and his staff.|I have been a patient of Dr Meyers and David Faron, PA for many years , my mother was a patient of Dr Meyers as well. I can't even begin to express what an amazing experience I've had with these physicians and staff. They not only treat your pain, they care about you and what's going on all around you and have helped me physically as well as emotionally. They are the most compassionate and caring group I've ever encountered , and I've not only seen many physicians as a patient and worked with many in my career .

They are very understanding of the trauma my body has been through & include lots of encouragement to reach my goals Thank you Mountain View Pain Center 

Photo belongs to Elie Kerr|I absolutely love this place! I have had my pain go from everyday and debilitating to managed and under control with the help of physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, trigger point injections, massage, Botox for my migraines, steroid shots for my bulging disc's, and medication that actually worked for my fibromyalgia (naltrexone in a micro dose), and no narcotics pushed for any of my pain. They don't push pills. They actually offer practical treatment that is working to reduce my pain and give me a body I can use again and not leave me bedridden like I was before. I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone experiencing pain.
The front desk staff is also amazing, especially Megan, she remembers my name and I don't even need to do anything when I walk in for an appointment anymore, they just already have me checked in, they're so attentive! Along with all the doctors and other staff I've interacted with. I highly recommend this place.
Pictured is the acupuncture room, the physical therapy area, the chiropractor area and the lobby.|Fraud 
No doubt that this place is committing insurance fraud. They want follow up appointments just to bill you. The billing department is terrible. It took them 11 months to file the claim with my insurance then billed me for the remainder over a year after I saw care. Pls seek professional help somewhere else. What they offer is not worth the hassle. Even their staff look over worked and overwhelmed.|I have chronic pain and was referred to mountain view by my rheumatologist .
I made the appointment and was seen by a Physician assistant .
We went over my problems and in my opinion I was not heard by her at all but she came up with a treatment plan and I started to do acupuncture and it helped some I had asked for some pain management health in the initial visit and was told that we needed treatment first witch I understand due to drug seeking junkies.
I did the treatment and like I said it. Helped
We'll I go through the treatment and a month and a half later I have my appointment for The p.a. again to discuss my pain and treatment plan.
I have to shovel snow to get to my vehicle to get to my appointment on time and when I get there they are closed? Wtf I call and was told they called to cancel the appointment due to weather.so I look at the time they called it was 20 minutes before the appointment.w.t.f in good weather I still would have been driving to get there on time ? And then I listen to the message and it tells me to call and reschedule the appointment. W.t.f ? You cancel and I have to call to make the appointment?
Well I went back for my acupuncture appointment today and I have to admit the young lady that does my acupuncture is and has always been professional and of the best quality.i thank her and hope she will find a quality place to work when this shit hole closes because the lack of care for the serious people in pain.
This place gets a f from me and the only thing they have going for them is the young lady that helped me.
Oh I never got any muscle relaxers or pain management at all .
Good luck if you decide to get help to manage pain at this place|These people lied about several things, but worse, are trying to keep my $275 cash because I don't have enough $ to get several procedures they sprang on me as being mandatory to be seen by them. OBVIOUSLY none of this was told to me when making the appt, because this is their scam, w/those who do not have ins. they also wouldn't give me a receipt either, so yeah- I think it's obvious what they are running here. they didn't even have my name or date of birth down right. Absolutely incredible. Now I'm going to have to get my attorney involved&its making my pain worse so I'll be having to sue for compensation. STAY AWAY. He advised me to make this review asap, since he said this is what some do. They have their people working in turkey and all over too, so it's way more elaborate than we probably even know.

I've always been very pleased with how I am treated. Erin makes me feel heard when I've spoken to her about my pain and I never feel rushed with my appointments. She is extremely knowledgeable and genuinely cares about her patients well being and finding the best solution for pain management. I would definitely recommend Colorado Clinic, as well as Erin, to others.

~Lynnette|I am leaving one star because you have to in order to leave a review. I was a patient here for about ten years, never had an issue. When my provider left, I was assigned to Shavonne to continue my care until I could get set up another doctor. My one and only apointment with Shavonne at first seemed to go well even though she had not even looked at my chart until my Telehealth appointment,which in of itself negligent. Next she told me they would do my knee injections but another provider would need to do them because she was booked, ok, no problem until I went to Scheduale the knee injections and was told by Elizabeth (Liz) that they don't do knee injections and haven't for about two years, which was a lie because my doctor was doing them about once a year. This Elizabeth then proceeds to tell me that the referral to the new pain office had been sent over and that they could not see me, which is a lie, legally, a medical provider is suppose to give 30 days of continued care to find a new provider and be able to see that new doctor. Next issue is, Shavonne obviously did not listen to me at my apointment because she put incorrect information into my chart regarding physical therapy, stating I refused recommend care - can't refuse something you are already receiving and have been for some time-had she of done her job correctly, she would have known this. Now, my new pain provider and I have been trying to get my records sent over to continue care since about September and nothing. Called a couple weeks ago or so and again spoke to Liz, who, again was extremely disrespectful and said she sent my records to my new doctors office on January 26th. Well I just had my monthly apointment with my new doctors office and she still has not recieved my records from Colorado Clinic - legally, they are required to have it sent over within 30 days. I stopped by the office this morning and it was locked up with a sign saying they are closed and to call the main number and guess what, nothing, just a recording that says to leave a message and then the phoneline hangs up. So, Colorado Clinic, here is the thing, you get me my records ready for me to pick up, you place them in my happy little hand for me to take to my new doctor and we won't have this conversation in front of the medical board and a civil judge. I have you on negligence, falsifying medical records, patient abondanment, and refusal to release MY medical records. I will be reporting Colorado Clinic to the department of regulatory agency and calling Tom martino and I suggest everyone who is and have had the same problems.|Abbie^ is my daughter. My name is Christine. I love Colorado clinic, I have been a patient since 2016. I think over the years I have seen every dr. at the clinic. But now I have Erin Christiansen. I absolutely love her. She is so patient. I feel like she understands me and believes me. Being chronically in pain, it's so important that your doctor believes you. I would recommend her to anybody that is in pain.|Dr shavonne is amazing. She's very personable. She actually remembers details and cares about my life as a whole. She listens and will make changes to meds as needed. I've been seeing her for a few years and I couldn't be happier to have her in charge of my care. The only issue I've ever had was getting ahold of the office and having calls returned. Other than that I have no complaints the new office in Greeley is much further away but worth the trip to continue to get care from my dr. I won't go anywhere else if I can help it. Thank you shavonne for being amazing.|Very impressed with timely follow up for help with my joint pain with good results. Dr Sisson is very informative, took time to discuss other appropriate treatment options and with a caring approach. All other associates from phone calls, to phone visits to treatment were friendly and professional.|If I could give a negative review,  I would!  I really like the doctors and P.As however the administration there is the worst.  Messages don't get passed on and don't even bother leaving one by voicemail because in the many years that I've been there I have NEVER gotten a call back from leaving a voicemail.
The latest issue is that a purely medical issue came up that was urgent and the office manager took it but did my P.A. get it? No.  And so for a week I was left without 2 critical meds.
And this is not just this office's problem as I've been to 3 of the clinics and they are all just as bad.
Unless Colorado Clinic's owner gets his act together and hires (or pays better or trains better because their turnover rate is terrible) a better staff, things will continue and there will be other clinics willing to pick up the slack.|Colorado Clinic disappeared in the night. Their offices are empty, nobody answers the phones, no responses to emails or requests from their web page. They left hundreds of patients without much-needed medications and care. There are patients with severe pain issues and injuries, cancer patients, etc. Colorado Clinic just closed their doors one day without telling any of us! No notice, no referrals to another pain doctor, nothing. I shudder for how many patients also went into withdrawal and how many are suffering right now. I'll be reporting them to the State Board and speaking with an attorney for patient abandonment and encourage any patient who was affected to do the same. My PCP will also be notifying the Board as she also tried repeatedly to reach any doctor or NP with Colorado Clinic, to no avail. What they've done is NOT okay.|I cannot thank you enough Dr.Sisson you and Erin Christensen have been so helpful in assessing my pain needs.I am so thankful for all of you even the staff at the Colorado Clinic. I appreciate you all and again I cannot thank you enough for assessing my needs during all my office visits. You all have been wonderful .
Sincerely
Karen Crouch

They are compassionate, very knowledgeable, and make me feel valued as a person. Living with chronic pain can be incredibly difficult. It is so much worse when you feel as if no one is really on your side, or even cares about what you are going through. I always leave CPI feeling confident that someone has my best interest at heart and is willing to help me face these challenges with their medical expertise. As a person who tends to be nervous about medical interventions, I also love that they are very supportive and helpful in regards to recommending more conservative approaches to controlling chronic pain. In many cases, there are a lot of things we, as patients, can do for ourselves. When I discuss my personal ""tools"" with them, I can tell they honestly appreciate what I am trying to do. In regards to the business staff... I have to say that I have not been to a medical facility where they are so friendly since my family dentist when I was a teenager. I have received a polite and warm welcome every single time I have come to an appointment at CPI. Even the folks I have spoken to on the phone system were very nice. That is not all that common in the Medical Industry these days. I highly recommend CPI!|Your one of the worst pain management companies ever dealt with. Called several times about my medicine and they don't call it in or even say why they Are not doing it. They called to change my appointment, I ride silver key and they need two weeks notice to reschedule a ride, so I reset my appointment as your company said with a voicemail which I still have. Then they tell me that they didn't do that and my appointment was on the same day as before after I cancelled my silver key ride and had to reschedule it. I reschedule my appointment first as I was told to do by your doctors. Now they will not give me my medicine. I have a lot of pain and Federal law says that you can't leave any one in pain or leave them without their medication. You have done this to me and as I found out you have been playing this game with several other people. Trying to charge for two visits or something? It is bad enough you charge $800 for an office visit and more if I see the doctor just to get my refills. If it wasn't the law of this dumb state I would never go, the cruelty is over wellming.|I have had 2 appointments at Capital Pain Institute and both times I felt acknowledged. Both  Dr Meyers and Patience, his PA seemed knowledgeable and were kind. They are in their own one story building and disabled parking was right in front of the building.|I had a referral sent to Capitol Pain Institute and have been waiting for a week to get scheduled. The referral has already been approved through Tricare but I keep getting the runaround with the scheduling people. I asked to talk with someone so they could explain why I have been waiting and no one has called me back. Very poor communication with the scheduling department, I can't image what the office will be like. Highly disappointing, I do not recommend this office.|I have been a patient here for awhile. Things use to run smoothly until recently. I have had an approved tricare referral since December 6th. I have yet to talk to anyone about scheduling a procedure, getting around there call screening company is a total pain in the rear! I guess in 2025 you need to show up on person at the office to schedule an appointment.|Dr. Meyer and his team are second to none! I have tried a few Dr.'s with no relief! I researched him and wanted to get into his office for a consultation. He did my spinal injections and gave me my life back! I have now been a few times and my quality of life is still going strong! I highly recommend he and his team!|So for some context. I use the VA for my health insurance as everything is covered. The VA will only approve a referral for a business that will take it. Meaning there shouldn't be an issue whenever you call to schedule as long as the referral has reached them.

Onto the issue. I called on 9/11/2024 to schedule my new patient appointment. They told me that they had received my referral however the insurance wasn't approved yet. So I said "" ok we'll schedule me my appointment now so that way I can be on the books and not have to wait any longer and potentially have people get in front of me"". The representative said ""yes I understand but we can't not do that as the insurance hasn't been approved yet"". Thats the first time. I called again today 9/16/2024. The same issue arises with a different representative. I then ask to speak to a manager and the manager told me she approved it and they would call me back to schedule which they haven't yet.

My point is that the VA will not provide me with a referral unless that business has to accept it. Meaning the insurance will be good no matter what. So why can't I schedule an appointment and be on the books instead of wasting my time while I'm in serious pain. Also even if they didn't ""approve"" it then ok, cancel the appointment...

As far as their actual services go I can't speak on that. As I haven't even gotten past the scheduling yet.

So here we go over a week now with still no appointment. That could have easily been on the books last week. Thank you guys for that. Outstanding performance.

Update: I have been receiving treatment from them now for well over a couple of months and the treatment has been amazing. They work with me and listen to me. The staff there is all kind and courteous as well. I do recommend this place. My only complaint and concern is the call center in which you have to go through initially. If they fixed that problem then this would be a 5 star place. But of course it's a business and their operating cost needs to be managed so they outsource their customer service department which is an interesting area to save money but it is what it is.|I am writing this review here because there seems to be no other way to communicate with Capitol Pain Institute.  I've been seen by Dr. Sandell in Colorado Springs for a year and I'm very happy having him as my Pain Doc.  I would rate Dr. Sandell a 5 star, but I rate the admin/business side of Capitol Pain Institute a 1.  Very unsatisfactory.  I've had 4 injections over the period of a year but have never once received a statement of my account, nor has it been made available online. I was told by Dr. Sandell's front desk personnel that they had no access to billing info, that all accounting operations had been centralized and that I would need to call the Austin billing office. They gave me the Austin phone number so I called and left a message, which was returned by a person named Lindsay on 9/24. She told me I had a credit balance on my account and said she could refund it and I told her yes, please send me a check.  I then had a follow up apptmt with Dr. Sandell on 9/30 and, when the front desk staff member requested a co-pay, I asked her to take it from my credit balance. I then asked her how I could obtain copies of my billing statement and she said she would have to request them online from the Austin office, and that it would take about 10 min to come in. That was the only way I was able to see the billing activity on my account, as there is NO info made available to me on my Capitol Pain Institute Patient Portal. what is shown instead is this message:  'Statements have not been published'.  I waited for a refund check to come but it never did, so I again tried calling Lindsay in the Austin office. I called on Oct 1, 3, 5, 7 and left messages but never received a call back from her, or anyone else.  I then called Dr. Sandell's office and got the answering service, who transferred me - again - to the Austin billing office. I called once again on Oct 9, waited a week and then called a different number I found on Capitol Pain Institute's main website and reached yet another answering service, who transferred me to Leslie Garza's extension, where I left yet another message. So here it is over a month later, I have still not received my reimbursement of funds due and I am unable to get in touch with a live person about it. In summary, 1) a patient cannot get past the answering service,2) there is no main customer service number to call for help, 3) no online chat available, 4) no phone numbers available other than the ones I have already been given that aren't being answered, 5) no online access to billing info, 6) no statements available....in short, zero transparency. I have the right as a patient to see what has been billed and posted to my billing account, yet the administration is making it impossible for me to get access to it.  At this point I have no choice but to drive down to the doctor's office to try and talk to the admin there, because I am out of ideas and shouldn't have to work this hard to get access to info I am entitled to.  In closing I want to stress again that I love Dr. Sandell and want to remain his patient, but the constant problems I've had with the answering service regarding both this matter, as well as scheduling issues, are unacceptable and unprofessional.  I did not want to post this on a public forum but I noticed that corporate seems to read the reviews so maybe this will get someone's attention, and let the people in power know that these problems are pervasive throughout the administrative side of the practice.",2024-11-25|2025-01-24|2025-02-11|2025-01-15|2025-01-23|2024-09-16|2024-09-16|2024-10-24,5|1|5|1|1|5|3|3,,,"10 a.m.|12 p.m.|11 a.m.",59.2|59.2|57.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|accessible_wheelchair_parking|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJwZykMn9PE4cRqQB2xTCyNT8,47

They will do whatever it takes to make your life better but you have to be willing, honest, and by by the rules. Meaning if your asked to try something or do something than do it because beating pain takes the patients effort also to try, understand, want the ability to achieve, and by by the rules set fourth from this clinic because its not just up to the doctor. The entire staff is respectful, caring, and willing to help. This clinic offers many different pain management techniques, totally professional, and they are very organized. I recommend to everyone that wants to get their chronic pain under control, live the positive life they been seeking, and to have a doctor that cares and understands.|Update: 10-22-21.  This is insane.  The amazing and wonderful Dr. Nguyen, like all other quality providers that have come to this practice, has left, and we're back to the nightmare that was.  I was encouraged to give Sondra Early another shot, and to her credit she sounded compassionate and filled my prescription.  Here's the nightmare...I called to schedule another refill appointment and was told that Sondra was out of town until after I needed a refill and they would call me back with another provider who could take care of me.  Five days later I get a call that I'm behind on my urine screening and NO PROVIDERS WILL ALLOW ME TO EVEN SCHEDULE an appointment until after I've provided one.  Now, let's just be clear, I've been a patient here for over five years.  In that time I've NEVER had a questionable urine screen.  I'm a model patient.  Here's the problem, they won't even get the results from the screen back until the day I run out of meds at the earliest, and THEN they will schedule me?

Here's the point, isn't it medical malpractice to prescribe someone a medication and then force them to go off of it abruptly for no fault of their own?  I've reached out to the office manager twice with no calls returned.  The problem is that everyone is a pill seeking junkie to them.   I understand that they have to protect themselves legally, but at what cost to the patient? I've now had four providers there in 5 years.  All the good ones leave, and I guess I should too.|Had a medical needs person that couldn't walk that needed help and I had to stop in the front of the building with medical van so they could get out easier, I got told by a Hispanic man that I'm not allowed to park there which I was not parked at all I was trying to help my medical needs person out of the vehicle, there were no parking spots whatsoever in the front because they were filled, my person who couldn't walk needed the best help,  then the Hispanic man who appeared to work at the front desk abruptly told me that he didn't care that I needed to go find a spot in the parking lot if I was that desperate.   It appears that This place does not care about people in need, The only care about business and parking spots, It sadness me that a special needs person is treated so poorly and how rude someone could be when they haven't walked a mile and someone else's shoes. Extremely unprofessional by any means hopefully someday they'll clean up their act and treat others how they wish to be treated.|The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not more is for DR. Erin Christianson, not sure of spelling, but she's been a God send and she's really the only reason I continue with my appts, I've made a good professional relationship with her as her pt, however, the bad part is I've had my last FOUR procedure appts cancelled on me for some different reason each time and I've really needed that back procedure. After several months, I still have not had it done yet, yet I get charged a lot for missing 1 a while back but they can keep cancelling on me making me while in total pain. If it weren't for Dr. Erin, I probably would look for another clinic, but the staff are very friendly and helpful though, so it is hard to give that up too.|If I could rate then 0 stars I could. My husband had been coming here for a year and every time we come, we have to wait 30 minutes past our appointment time before we are taken back. We show up early, he gets taken back 30 minutes late. We show up on time, he sets taken back 30 minutes late. It didn't matter. Then when booking appointments we have to wait months between appointments or hope someone cancels. Every time they have a new excuse. Speaking with other patients I hear similar stories. The only reason this clinic is still in business is because their patients have no other options. Otherwise I know they would be losing patients left and right.|If you have a couple of hours to spend waiting this is the right  place for you. The staff are rude. When I first started going there was seeing a decent person each time and wasn't too bad. She was nice,had you in and out pretty quick. But a couple of times had late afternoon appointments and got calls saying something had came up and if I couldn't get there before 11 would have to reschedule. We live about 50 miles from the place and takes an hour to get there depending on traffic,weather conditions. One time I made an honest mistake and showed up the day after my actual appointment for my scheduled appointment. It was my fault,I wrote the wrong date down. What happened then was almost comical. They told me I could go home and call each morning to see if anyone canceled, Now I couldn't sit there to see if someone called it made an honest mistake like me and didn't show up, but could drive back home 50 miles and call to see if an opening comes up and call each day to see if there was one,this after driving 50 miles one way in a snow storm when the day before when my appointment was the weather was nice. They blame everything on people leaving. Not being able to keep employees should tell you all you need to know. If I had a 10 am appointment would be 30-40 minutes before even getting called to the back,then would sit there another 20 minutes waiting to be seen. The guy who did my last injections was new and horrible at it. He just pokes and prods you like you were livestock of some sort.I've been going to pain management for 11 years now and this is by far the worst place I've been too.|This has been the worst experience I've ever had. I have been going to this clinic for over a yr.
From the very beginning the front desk ladies ( London ) were extremely rude.
I was suppose to get my refill last week, I went in the day before and did my UA. The next day I was suppose get my meds and 20 mins past my phone appt, I got a call from the NP telling me I was dropped as a patient because I didn't get my endoscopy done. I've already had 3 endoscopy and 3 colonoscopies, with still no clue as towh at was wrong.  They did not care if I went through withdraw .|I was just informed that they are closing their doors, which is sad.

Morgan and Dr hsu are great - but their staff is not. Their medical assistant dropped the ball on a preauthorization that was never submitted or received by my insurance company. So I called my insurance company and they explained they didn't have anything on file. Not a preauthorization, not anything. Called the office back and the assistant continued to argue with me and say she submitted the request on Jan 22. I called my insurance again and ended up having my insurance leave a voicemail stating they do not have anything even pending.|I'm honestly very shocked at my experience here. I have stage 4 endometriosis and some other suspected issues that cause me severe chronic pain in my pelvis, hips, lower back, and abdomen. My OBGYN referred me here (will be contacting her office to not use this place anymore) and I was originally scheduled for yesterday. I have a TBI and have to put everything on my calendar or I don't remember. When I had made the appointment, the person on the phone confirmed with me that I would be coming in at 11am. I get there day of, they say my appointment was at 10am and I was almost an a hour late. I figured it was on me and my TBI brain, and was rescheduled for today. My appointment (confirmed verbally multiple times) was at 1:15pm. When I go my confirmations this time, I double checked, and it said 1pm. So I called and was told that it said 1pm even though I was scheduled for 1:15 pm because I needed to be 15 minutes early. I get there, check in, no problem. I ended up waiting for almost an hour. Checked in at 1pm, called back at 1:50pm. I had arrived with 2 other people who were in and out while I was still waiting. I get back to the room and it's 2 medical students, which normally I don't mind because I get they have to learn and observe. Whatever. These girls were acting like it was a mock class day or something with a pretend patient. They didn't seem to know what they were doing at all and were more interested in talking to each other than me, the patient, coming in for severe chronic pain and chronic illness. It was a little after 2pm when they left. About 5 minutes later, the physicians assistant came in like she was is in a massive rush and I was the inconvenience. She rushes through her questions and her tone was condescending and rude, which didn't match her fake kind words. She had me stand up to feel around the areas where my pain is and as I did so, she asked some questions about my cane (I have vertigo and pots and chronic pain, I can't be mobile without it) and looked at me like I had no reason to need it. She started pushing around my lower back to get an idea of what hurts and what doesn't. Normal right? Nope. She wasn't just feeling or poking she was digging what felt like her whole knuckle along my lower back and hip area which set off a fiery, burning, sharp pain. I flinched, gasped, and instinctively tried to move away but she didn't stop and just kept digging across multiple times. The only acknowledgement she gave was ""ya that hurts, ya okay"". When she stopped, I wanted to cry and was thankful she told me to sit on the patient table, but one of the students came back to get the assistant who promptly left, in the middle of my examination. I looked at the clock and it was only 2:10pm. She'd barely been examination me for 10 minutes. I waited until almost 2:20pm and then I just walked out. I can't drive currently so a family member always takes me to appointments and today luckily it was my no nonsense dad. I texted him to come in and meet me so I could have someone walking me out. This behavior to me is insanely unprofessional, rude, and honestly vile. I've never walked out in the middle of an appointment like that. While I know I missed my original appointment, I wish I had missed this one.|Dr Hsu and Morgan are amazing! I've been seeing Dr Hsu for about 11 years, and refuse to even think about going somewhere else no matter how far away I move. He has treated me for chronic pain with several different injection types and has been a literal lifesaver, helping me keep a quality of life after life changing injury. He listens to what I say and knows exactly how to treat my various issues and conditions. He explains thoroughly and makes sure I understand what is happening, potential risks.
Morgan has shown compassion for my current state as well as concern for future needs. She always listens and both agree and Dr Hsu give me the time I need to make sure I am a participant in my care.|Doctor Hsu is super dedicated to releaving pain in my back and knees. Love the staff for their understanding and professionalism.|The doctor was amazing and made me feel so much better made me feel so comfortable. I really appreciate the how kind everyone was. My back and neck feels so much better. Thank you so much|I've been very pleased with the results of the PRP treatment. The doctor and his staff are very helpful. I just wish I had done it sooner|This place is amazing!!! Dr. Hsu is articulate and was very good  communicating with me; even during my procedure, he talked me through it. His follow up is superb!
The office is professional and efficient at getting patients on schedule quickly. Very thorough, friendly and professional team!!
I'd recommend anyone with pain involving spine and rehab to contact Spine, Pain and Rehab!!!!|I have been seeing Dr Hsu for years. Dr Hsu and PA Morgan and all of their staff are always nice and make my experience easy and stress free. I have a 20 year old injury, and have a fusion in between my L5 and S1 and Dr Hsu treats the unfixed disc between the L4 and L5. Dr Hsu has been treating me with cortisone injections on this disc for years now and he does a phenomenal job! Every single time he has done this procedure it has been on point and went above and beyond my expectations of relief. So it's fair to say he is gifted at his job! It is the only thing that has made me completely feel like a normal person over the years. He is the only doctor to provide relief in my back and nerves down my right leg and foot. The only doctor in twenty years out of many until I found this office! This has been life changing to me, in order to feel absolute relief and normal in my daily activities. He is kind and supportive and I really want to thank him and PA Morgan (she is awesome too, easy to talk to, and very understanding) and all their staff- thanks for your kindness and patience- for helping me over the years. I don't trust anyone else with my spine and I look forward to getting the prp injection coming up as a more permanent long term solution. If you are having trouble finding a trustworthy doctor to go see, who cares and will actually help you, in what feels like hopeless situations when it comes to back and nerve pain, I highly recommend this doctor! He will help you. Thank you,  I look forward to my prp procedure.",2025-02-06|2025-02-13|2024-09-13|2025-01-09|2024-10-22|2024-10-24|2024-03-11|2024-04-25,1|1|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJU7PZuzF-bIcRQjVMvyjiatM,85

If I had my choice again I'd try somewhere else but at this point , they have my urine I feel like I'm locked in lol . This is a doctors office being run like a probation office.|Wouldn't recommend for a variety of reasons: staff, bedside manner and education level of practitioners, and abuse of insurance/treatment plans (they'd love for you to come in as frequently as possible to charge insurance for unnecessary and unwanted medical treatment). If you want your medical experience to feel like a McDonalds, this is your best bet. Look elsewhere for real care.|Having been a patient of Mountain View Pain Center (MVPC)  for a few years, my experiences with them have come full circle. When I first sought out MVPC for my Chronic Pain Management needs I was very pleased with those individuals that were directly involved with my care and the group as a whole. I saw them monthly for my pain management medication refills and medicine adjustments as needed. I also had physical therapy with them, initially 2x per week and then 1x per week as my condition slightly improved. After many weeks of physical therapy I began doing my own physical therapy at home due to the cost of doing it with MVPC. However, I did continue to see MVPC for my prescription pain management needs. After a few more months I personally saw an alarming turnover rate with the PAs that were treating me. Within a period of about 9 months I had been seen by 5 different PAs at different offices all around the Denver metropolitan area because the MVPCs PAs kept quitting for some unknown reason. I had to drive quite far to get to several different MVPC locations where they actually had PAs left that hadn't quite quit MVPC yet. It was at this point in my experience with MVPC that I became quite upset and depressed above and beyond my baseline depression. I couldn't obtain any consistency or build any relationship with MVPCs PAs  I was assigned to because after a couple of visits they kept resigning from MVPC.  I am also not able to work anymore due the severe chronic pain I have been dealing with for many years. A few months ago I was assigned my 5th PA with MVPC in the short amount of time I have been under their care. During my most recent prescription pain management appointment I was completely unexpectedly informed that MVPC would no longer be able to see me as a patient. MVPCs reasoning for rejecting me to receive care from them thereafter didn't seem anywhere close to reaching a reasonable threshold to stop caring for someone like me that deals with severe chronic pain, severe depression and not being able to work due to my medical condition. Additionally, you would think that a medical office who has so much turnover and who made me drive to multiple offices all over the Denver metro-area would want to show me that they actually care about their patients. Needless to say, because of MVPCs revolving door, ever resigning PAs, I felt that no one there was interested in forming a Doctor/Patient relationship with me. It seemed to me that MVPC only cared about the money. The owners and/or principals at MVPC who are Doctors took the Hypocratic Oath towards the end of their academic career. Apparently, given my experience with MVPC, they don't even care about the Oath they all swore to uphold. In closing, given my experience with MVPC and the fact that there are many pain management care professionals all over the Denver Metro-area, I strongly encourage you to seek out others and not MVPC.|I absolutely love the people in this office! They are all polite, warm, and caring! Coming here was one of the best decisions I've made.|they did great job

Unfortunately, after seeking help from numerous doctors and exploring various avenues for pain management, this was my final attempt at finding relief.

Dr. Jan Gillespie-Wagner and Darci Rossitier were Dismissive and Uncaring.  During my appointment, the doctors I encountered displayed a hostile and aggressive demeanor.  They failed to consider the impact of my chronic pain on my daily life.  Furthermore, they seemed quick to dismiss my concerns and stereotype me as a patient, rather than listening to my specific experiences.

They were apathetic towards atypical pain. The most concerning aspect was their lack of understanding or apparent disregard for my non-typical pain condition. Instead of offering help, they were dismissive and pushed me away as a patient.

A Broken System: It's disheartening to realize how many people suffer at the hands of these medical professionals who are supposed to help.  This experience is just one more example of how the current system fails patients with non-standard conditions. DO NOT GO HERE|I love Dr. G and her office! I've been going here 3 years now and I'm so happy to have found them. Been dealing with lower back pain from arthritis and sciatica for many years now. Dr. G and her staff always listen to me and treat me with care and respect. At one point I moved farther away from her clinic and tried a different pain doctor. It was horrible!!! I was so happy to go back to Dr. G! I know a good doctor when I see one and she is one of the good ones! I'm so thankful for her and her wonderful office!|Colorado Pain Management has been very effective at treating me. The people at CPM are compassionate and caring. They take the time to get to know you and to understand your situation. They are equipped with many options to help manage chronic discomfort. I've had nothing but a pleasant and professional experience with everyone at
CPM.|I have been waiting since December for a call to schedule after they got authorization.  My Physician from UCHealth has placed my referral twice now!
When she followed up with them where I am in the process of being scheduled, they told her they tried calling me and my phone number was out of order! Which is a lie! No one called.  I have now called office several times to follow up and schedule, and rudely told someone would call me back! This place is unreal, and if your in pain, I believe they just don't care. I don't want pain pills! I just want some relief from severe lumbar pain before I proceed with surgery in the fall. Someone not doing their job, and definitely don't care!!!  Obviously, just a warm body filling a chair at that office!!! I have reported this to my physician, hoping they will not refer others there. Just terrible!|Dr. Gillespie and her team have saved my life. Before finding her I had almost given up hope. I have a condition known as CRPS. I had become a shell of who I was before my injury that led to my condition. Dr. Gillespie started treating me with Stellate Ganglion Nerve Blocks and Ketamine infusions which have been game changers. For the first time in years I am planning for my future again. I would give them more than 5 stars if I could.

Edit: after reading other reviews I just want to add that they have always gotten me in for a treatment one way or the other. Dr. Gillespie has treated me instead of taking a lunch break. Her staff have always been kind and compassionate. It's a bummer reading reviews from reviewers who never got in to see her. I can't speak to the tedious bureaucracy that is insurance but I can speak to her abilities. After years of struggling to find a Dr. who would actually listen to me and help me I am so grateful I finally did. I know there are so many people struggling with chronic pain and I know that most people won't ever find a great Dr. Who really cares. I am blessed I did.|By far the best doctors and staff in health care. I have been in a great deal of pain for almost 9 months. My mother goes here as well. She told them how much pain I was in. They stayed open later just to get me in to help give me pain relief while I wait for my procedures to be done at the hospital. Every single staff member was so kind and understood that I was in pain. Today I had a video teleheath appointment, and met even more staff. They all were so kind and wanted to truly help me. They listened to my concerns and I felt I was heard. I highly recommend them to anyone that is needing to get their pain under control.|Brought my wife in for a specific knee procedure. My wife has had 8 knee surgeries and a complete knee replacement. Our appointment was set for 2:45 PM we arrived at 2:15 PM as she was a new patient. We did not see the doctor until 5:00 PM, in that span we were moved to 2 different rooms, seen by three different people (who were not the doctor and asked some pretty ridiculous questions). We had nurses? come in and ask if we had seen other nurses because they could not locate them. I stuck my head out of the room at 4:45 to ask when we would see the doctor and was told she had an emergency and that was the delay. If I had not stuck my head out who knows when we would have been told this! So after three hours and two people manipulating my wife's  knee we were ready to throw in the towel. We scheduled the procedure and went home. The next day my wife called the office to ask if they could provide her with some pain medication until the procedure (about 6 days). I will not detail the ineptitude and hostility we encountered/endured but suffice it to say that my wife was treated as if she was an addict shopping for pain meds! Given the total lack of professionalism and organization by the front office we canceled the procedure. I am amazed that this office is still in business as I would not recommend them to anyone. I only wish I had read the reviews here before putting my wife through this experience.|I started the referral process a couple of months ago. Once this office said they finally received the referral, they said the doctor would review my referral to see if she would accept me as a patient. This person also told me she was confused because they do not treat CF. This was NOT the reason for the referral (but included as background health information as it relates to the issue at hand). I heard nothing for several weeks, all the while enduring significant pain flares related to arthritis. I called yesterday and was told that the doctor denied the referral. I asked for the date of the denial and reason. I was told there was no date, and that the doctor does not write reasons for the denial. HERE IS MY COMPLAINT: 1) the doctor doesn't give a reason, and never even spoke with me about why I was there. If the first person believed I was there to be treated for CF, I could have told her that was ridiculous, as I see some of the best CF doctors at National Jewish. 2) I was never called to say they denied me and I should move on and seek help elsewhere. I would still be waiting had I not called. I believe this is MEDICAL NEGLECT. If you CANNOT provide care to someone who is in desperate need of help, you should SAY SO.

I now have to go back to square one and find someone who can help with pain flares related to arthritis.

I could write a few pages on how awful my experience was with Elena.

No compassion combined with militant mismanagement is the best way to describe the experience with the personality of a rattlesnake..

Had to keep track of my pain management  dosage and numbers were consistently wrong.|I have been suffering from chronic pain from spinal injuries and Fibromyalgia for over a decade. I have been gaslit & humiliated & treated like a ""med seeker"" by dozens of doctors including other pain management docs before but I have never been treated like that here.
Dr. Elena is an incredibly well informed & thorough. She spent a long time gathering my history & records and she did a thorough hands-on physical evaluation (which is weirdly rare now) and she came up with a treatment plan that even considered my concerns about becoming medication dependent.
Yes, sometimes the office can have a lengthy wait at times, but that is due to the high quality care the providers are giving every single patient and all of the legal requirements laid out by the state.
The office staff are angels. They go well above & beyond to ensure you're taken care of and are always pleasant to see.

I never thought I'd ""enjoy"" going to a doctor but I always leave feeling better about my care & often in less pain than I walked in with.

I have received trigger point & nerve block injections and her well researched management protocols are light-years ahead of other local providers. I can't recommend her highly enough.

(Office is also clean, well organized, stays on top of insurance & pharmacy issues- and they accept medicaid!)|Dr Elena is the best doctor I've ever had. She's in a category of her own. Never before has a doctor spent so much time with me, shown so much care and displayed such breadth and depth of knowledge. She goes above and beyond and, frankly, puts the average doctor to shame.

For years I looked for the right doctor to help me with significant back issues. After being referred to Dr Elena, my symptoms have radically improved and my quality of life has skyrocketed. I'm deeply grateful to her and her staff.

Disregard negative reviews about this office. The staff is fantastic and very helpful, and the location is easily accessible and comfortable.|I can honestly say that I don't know what I would be like now had I not have started care with Elena 5 months ago. I drive almost 3 hours one way just to see her. Not only is she compassionate, but she knows what she is talking about. I have a rather rare condition that not many medical professionals are knowledgeable on. In fact most doctors in my area either do not know of it or are not comfortable treating me due to lack of knowledge on it. When I first explained my situation she knew exactly what my diagnosis was and acknowledged me and everything I was feeling. I've always felt heard and cared for by not only her, but her ENTIRE staff. From the reviews I read before my first visit there was complaints about the wait to see her. The way I see it is this, she takes whatever time necessary to make sure you are well cared for, and heard. I couldn't ask for a better provider, and I will continue to make the drive to see her! Thank you for being such a wonderful addition to my medical care team.|I've been going to Colorado Pain Relief for a few months and could not be more pleased. Elena has done a terrific job working with me on referrals and medication. She's a compassionate and caring provider who spends the amount of time she needs to spend on each visit. Lori at reception is a real standout in a very friendly and warm crew.|Helena has been an amazing doctor. She listened to me and showed that she cares and has been instrumental in my success at work. I have been able to manage my career and my home life and been a much happier person because of her thoroughness and understanding and she cares! She has been an amazing doctor and I couldn't have become the person I am today without her!|This office is the best and Dr.Elana and her staff are the most accommodating.  The office is always clean and welcoming. Dr. Elena's knowledge with pain and managing pain are exceptional . Every doctor office should be this welcoming and helpful.  It's always nice when you're doctor and the staff, genuinely care about the patients.  I recommend Colorado Pain Releif for anyone!!!|Just like everyone else who's had Dr. Elena as their pain provider I had a horrific experience. My last pain specialist dropped me due to missing too many appointments because I moved and life was hectic. My first appointment with Doctor Elena she immediately bad mouthed Mathews Vu pain management, when I had a great experience with them. It was unprofessional. On top of my first appointment the practice manager Tameshia Campbell was so unprofessional. She made an unsolicited statement about taking to my doctor about a hysterectomy (Not a cure) and when I said that she said well maybe you wouldn't be in pain. It was so unethical. Just like everyone else's negative experience. Dr. Elena wouldn't even look at me.  I'd wait around for almost 2 hours and not once did she look up from her computer. She always interrupted me and when I went to tell her I didn't have time for other PT I wanted UC health PT, she shooed me out of the room, I didn't even know our session was ending. She's quick to assume that because tramadol (schedule 4) worked for me that I was drug seeking and my first appointment they tried to push Gabapentin (schedule 5) on me.  I reached out and asked for a small presc of tramadol and 800mg of Motrin for pain. I was turned down and had enough. After asking to be self- discharged due to the mistreatment and medical gaslighting Ms. Campbell made my letter sound like I just wanted drugs.

WORST system I have EVER encountered in 11 years of chronic pain! I was referred to Dr Wright and NEVER saw him in 3 visits! I saw his PA Shannon, who was absolutely awesome. Yes, probably the only one in the office who was pleasant. They were so booked that it was hard to get follow up appointments... I thought, ""Wow, they must be really popular!"" NOPE. The office was CLOSING and nobody bothered to tell me this as I scheduled my two follow up appointments. In fact, they rescheduled my second follow up because the office was going to be closed before then. They then proceeded to reveal that Dr Wright had undergone surgery himself and ran into complications which is why I had never seen him. They promised they were holding meeting with other physicians to possibly find one to sponsor the clinic and be the stand-in Dr. while he recovered. They told me to call back. So I called back every day and it was the same story until one day, no one answered. I received a hefty bill in the mail for a service which had previously been covered and that I had been promised I would not be billed for. And trust me, my insurance covers nearly everything in the book 100% with a small copay. I battled and battled and the billing company and other managers sent me round and round with multiple phone numbers without any resolution. Now I am being forced to pay this stupid bill without any explanation as to why it I will be sent to a collection agency. If you ever see anyone associated with these people, RUN.|I am convinced that there is no better doctor than Dr. Rob Wright.  I have seen hundreds of doctors, due to the fact that I had kidney cancer and many other serious health issues, and have endured over 30 surgeries.  I know a great doctor when I see one.  Not only is Dr. Wright the very best surgeon I have ever been blessed to be his patient ~ but his staff is second to none!!  Every single nurse and PA, from Ashton, Jaime, Alex, Susie, Bonnie, and countless others, have the utmost of compassion, caring words and perfect bed~side manner that I would highly reccommend anyone in need of a surgeon to get into see Dr. Wright and his amazing staff ASAP.
This is by far the best practice I have witnessed.  I am so grateful !!  May God continue to bless each and every single person in the practice.|Dr Natkin and Crystal are cutting edge when it comes to giving the best current modern treatments available, and always searching for sustainable outcomes. He is relentless in the pursuit of finding the best methods to help completely rehabilitate, or at the least bring better comfort to those that may be a on a long road to recovery. Dr. Natkin always carries a charisma and a comfort with him every visit that helps ease frustration and gets you focused on next steps to recovery. If you looking for a pill pusher this isn't your practice, but if you're looking for results my experience has bee second to none!!!|This is the worst place to do business with. DO NOT EVER GO HERE. Had a procedure done in March for pain in my neck.  Woke up and ended up with pneumonia.  Called numerous times on the after hours emergency line since they don't answer during the day - Ended up in the emergency room twice to be treated.  This doctor put me on Lithium as pain management (NOT ONE DOCTOR I SPOKE WITH SAID IT'S USED FOR THIS TREATMENT).  Never weaned me on or off and still couldn't return my after hour calls for the excessive pain I was still encountering.  They couldn't bill their invoices correctly and still can't figure out why they haven't been paid properly. I filed complaint with BCBS and am filing complaint against him with NORA.  Office Assistant is rude and unprofessional.  Don't waste your time with this place.  It's a joke!!|First, I was greeted by Jason Montgomery for an ""evaluation"".  He is NOT an anesthesiologist nor a physician at all.  He was an hour late with no apology.  He was rude and hostile to me from the moment he walked in for no apparent reason.  He chided me for being on even the greatly reduced meds I was taking stating that they, meaning the real doctors, couldn't do the procedures when a person was taking meds because they wouldn't be able to ascertain whether the procedures worked.  I stated that since my pain was at a level of 8-9, I could detect any lessening of that pain and that Dr Little from another pain group had performed an ill-fated epidural which exacerbated and widened the areas of my pain. He became more belligerent and I left never to return.  It was a horrible, frustrating and frankly demeaning experience.  I've had several back surgeries over the past 15 months and have been in constant pain like many of you.  Do we deserve this kind of treatment?|Rachel is awesome. I've been going here for years now, unfortunately.  I seem to have issues that aren't in your face on an xtay like yup that's broken. Leave it to me to get stuck with something that's hard to see in diagnose yet excruciating everyday pain, unfortunately.  After seeing so many doctors that look at you like nothing is wrong with you and brush you of the same. It was such a great feeling to finally have someone listen and care enough to not stop thinking outside the box. Because of her, I finally have a name to what causes my pain . Honestly, I'm sure anyone who knows her knows what I'm talking about is just an awesome person and perfect for the job. She's so energetic and literally makes me laugh. Every time she is full of energy, she fills the entire building up with good vibes.  And I'm a super quiet person and definitely not social, but she makes it easy to talk to her.  Unfortunately, the secret is out cause she's always booked now lol but she's great, and it's definitely appreciated.|Dr. Wright is hands down the best doctor I have ever worked with. I was in a hit and run MVA in April 2012 and have been an 8 or 9/10 in pain since then. Dr. Wright spends as much time as necessary to answer all my questions, and after 7 doctors and 19 different procedure: Trigger point injections, medial branch blocks, SIJ injections, 6 epidurals, 2 discograms, etc I can say without a doubt he is  the most knowledgeable, confident, friendly, and all around awesome doc I have seen. I trust him to do anything on my back, and that speaks for itself.. Highly recommend this office.|The receptionist is  very pleasant!   And knows what she is doing!!She always asks me how i am feeling, if i have any new concerns i need to address to the dr.  Dr. Natkins is the best Dr. Ive ever had!!He takes out the time to go over any issue i have.he has always been concerned about any medical condition that I have, and he offers me different types of treatment.

He is kind, listens to your concerns, and his office is extremely efficient.  I drive an hour and 20 minutes to see him.

Dr. Wernick and his office go way out of their way to make your experience positive.  Once the facility where injections are done miscoded the procedure and instead of having me reschedule until they could figure it out they made a ton of calls during their lunch to make sure I got the injection that day.

I definitely recommend Dr. Wernick.|I hope you never need a pain doctor but if you do call Dr. Wernick. The entire staff at Dimensions are very thoughtful and caring. Thank you!|Dr. Wernick is patient, knowledgeable and listens. He gathers relevant information before making recommendations. I highly recommend him.|Dr Wernick was lovely....very concerned and warm...and really took the time to explain everything.|Very pleasant experience.Dr Wernik was amazing.He explained the procedure. Staff was helpful & friendly.|Dr. Wernick, not only settled any worries or concerns.  He's made my life of mobility, hope for the future and glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel.  He corrected my last doctor's mistakes. And I couldn't ask for a better doctor. A kind man told me about him in the waiting area and I couldn't agree more that he's worth the drive to see, and the best at what he does.

Extremely grateful|This was my first time seeing this doctor. My CRPS flared up after being in remission for many years. Dr. Wernick took time to listen to me and explain some things. He appeared to genuinely care about my pain. The only thing I didn't like was that he would not prescribe me even 5 pain pills to have in case the CRPS goes full blown. I do however understand because abusers of drugs have ruined it for people who really need something and I would have liked it if the doctor looked into my drug use to verify I don't abuse drugs and was not doctor shopping. I feel some type of pain pill even in a very small amount should not have been an issue. There is no way I will be able to drive to this office to get a nerve block if I'm in severe pain and I won't have anyone who can take me.take me. It will be dangerous if not impossible for me to drive if CRPS is full blown . I do understand his position but it just doesn't help me if I'm in excruciating pain. He did say he could more than likely get me in for a nerve block within a short time though. That will probably be expensive however.
He presented as a very compassionate doctor who is willing to explain things and I believe he is very knowledgeable about CRPS. Not all doctors are familiar with CRPS so I basically feel like he has taken time to learn about this illness! I appreciate him taking me as a new patient too! I just pray this doesn't go full blown because unless you have CRPS, you Will not understand how painful it truly is. I'm hopeful he will be able to help me if needed but am terrified of what will happen if my condition worsens. The only reason for 4 stars is because I have nothing to help me when pain is unbearable.|Dr. Wernick goes above and beyond  for his patients. If the insurance provider denies authorization for a necessary procedure, he will schedule a peer to peer review with the physician for the insurance to discuss medical necessity to advocate on behalf of his patient.

They offer a variety of treatments. I get a weekly vitamin IV drip, and I always leave feeling amazing! I highly recommend them! They are always very fun and professional! Stop by and tell them Pierre sent you!|I absolutely love Mile High. The doctors,  nurses and IV specialists are amazing. The vitamin IVs have helped with my energy. I love the exosome therapy as well for energy. I'm a type I diabetic and they help with my diabetes as well. I highly recommend Mile High.|Dr. Hettick is wonderful, he is very kind and welcoming. He actually listens to all of your problems and concerns and addresses them. Would highly recommend coming to this clinic. Staff is also very nice, can't say enough good things!|I can't say enough great things about Dr. Hettick and his wonderful staff. I came into the office with severe lower back pain and mid-back stiffness, making it nearly impossible to enjoy playing with my kids. Thanks to Dr. Hettick's expertise, I was back on my feet quickly--with lasting results. The level of care and excellence in this office is truly exceptional and hard to find elsewhere.|I came to Mike High Spine and Pain Center after getting into a car accident and it has always been a 5 star experience for me every time I go in. Dr. Hettick and his staff are amazing and always listen to what's going on and how to fix it as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is such an amazing chiropractic and I always look forward to my appointments and getting to see the staff!|Dr. Hettick and his staff are wonderful and really care about their patients and their families.  Dr Hettick treated my husband for years before he passed.  I have also been a patient for several years and my 15 year old granddaughter started getting adjusted too.
Dr. Hettick is very knowledgeable and if you ask him a question he does not know the answer he will research it for you.  I get adjusted every week and always feel better after.  I have been getting the Meier's cocktail (medicare covered) for 6 months and feel amazing.  It really helps with fatigue and boosts my immune system to help fight off colds and flu like symptoms.
I would highly recommend Mile High Spine and Dr. Hettick.|I was hesitant on seeing a chiropractor but here I was made comfortable and educated on my needs and not just myself for my baby and spouse.

I didn't feel pressured to get injections or take medication. He seemed pleased and encouraging that I want to take a conservative physical therapy approach.

We are so vulnerable, especially when the condition is pain. I have more than one issue, pain-wise. Dr C Huser is serious about conservative treatment, and efficacy, which is how a patient benefits/or not, from a treatment. I am relieved to find that his treatments work well for me. I seriously couldn't walk straight any more. my entire being was failing, spineless, headaches. I can read again, walk, garden, type. Miraculous. The staff, I am grateful to say, has been kind to me. best wishes to all.|Dr. Huser:  Your a great Doctor, wanted to send you a few jokes... Do you know why its great to be a guy?  1) phone conversations last 30 seconds...2) A 5 day vacation requires only one suitcase... 3) Bathroom lines are 80% shorter... 4) you can open all your own jars... My knee is coming along well... see you in about 90 days...|Dr Huser is one of the best doctors I have ever seen.  He was patient, understanding and empathy.  He got me into a good place with realistic expectations.  I would recommend him without hesitation.|The biggest problem with Dr Huser is his support staff and clinc management. Although the quality of his care did degrade as time went on. His MAs Ruby and Victoria are unprofessional and mean. They talk badly about patients and this is clearly seen in my medical record as inter office communications. (do they even know we can read them?) They are young and immature in positions of powed as noted by the words chosen in the office communications as well their flippant tone. I have never been treated so disrespectively before and we as patient consumers need to speak up and not allow this to become the norm in our health care. When I walked into the office the get missing medical records I finally got the attention of the clinic manager, Dava (whom I had left multiple messages for over the last 2 months and never got a call back) and she asked me to shared my concerns with her. She would not see my perspective in any way and only defended her staff. She didn't even have the management skills to feed me lip service, pretend to care, and go about her way promoting poor patient care at this practice. As for Dr. Huser, I'd say he's hit or miss at this point. And if he chooses to surround himself with support staff like this, then what does that tell you?|The best experience I've ever had with a medical office to date! Dr. Huser was very thorough and compassionate. He really listened to me and I feel completely confident in his care as my Doctor. His office always responds promptly and seems to be one step ahead, making my experience pleasant and stress free which helps immensely as a patient with MS who has to deal with medical offices on a regular basis. Highly recommend!
* I also see the P.A. Carissa and she has been absolutely wonderful!|The days of opioid abuse have never been worse and people that truly need and benefit from pain medication suffer because of it. I have spinal fusion from my 1st S1 to L1. Have had multiple back surgeries. As I'm getting older its getting hard to do everyday chores. At urgent cares or ER rooms they treat me like I'm a just wanting pills so I never asked. I was referred to MD pain. I saw Dr. Huser. He was very sympathetic and helped me come up with a plan that has started to give me my life back. Everyone there has been amazing. Ladies at the front treated me like family after 5 min of being there. I was showing pics of my new puppy. Wish I'd gone there years ago. Thank you all.|Dr Huser is a very caring physician. I have been a patient of his for almost 10 years. He does the injections on my spine. His staff is great. I moved out of state and I continue to return to Colorado so that I can continue my care with Dr. Huser. I  have not been able to find a Doctor with his level of expertise or compassion in Tennessee. Thank you everyone at MD Pain!|Had my first appointment with MD Pain about a week ago. The staff was very professional and kind.

I had the MILD procedure a week and a half ago, and was pretty nervous going into it, but all has worked out well.

Forget ever speaking with Dr Brooks, he doesn't allow office visits or phone calls.  You will only see him at the time of your procedure and be thankful if he has read your chart at all.
The office personnel stinks!   Every time I came in the office staff were just standing around whispering and when they had to assist you could tell they weren't pleased.
Even the medical staff were rude and unpleasant.  It was a nightmare.  Im sure I'll be attacked as others who have left honest experiences on here were.  They are very good at twisting the facts to benefit themselves.
Look at all the negative comments on here and ask yourself if all these could be made up.
While Dr Brooks always comes off as being pleasant and friendly, I have to question his ethics to allow all these things to take place while under his name. Seems like he doesn't want to hear any complaints but just wants to do the procedures and collect his paycheck. I know he was let go from another pain specialists before opening this current office so it makes me question his caring for his patients.
Stay away and save yourself a lot of stress and frustration.|Use to give a 5 star glowing review, but changed it. Don't be honest with anything you tell them about life or how you feel.. just always be perfect and lie   I'm sure he will blame me since that seems to be the vibe by the responses bad reviews get. I was never rude to anyone there and over the course of like 6 years had 2 incidents that I was honest about and one issue I had zero idea how it happened. I offered to do whatever was needed to fix that one issue but was told it was no big deal and sometimes it happens. Yea I shouldn't have been honest about anything since I was rewarded with being dropped. Yet they saw no issue with me continuously taking 10,000mg or more a day of Tylenol because I was still in pain, I was only ever lectured that I shouldn't take so much because I was damaging my liver. It's a roll of the dice what kind of care you seem to receive here, it was amazing when I was perfect and just smiled saying yea im good.

Also adding that they seem to think just because you have chronic pain you shouldnt do things to embrace life, instead I guess you're expected to sit on a couch all day. Some of us fight through the pain so we can lead a fulfilling life, it was a blessing to be discharged so that I can find someone who would rather help then hinder.|I went to Doctor Brooks for many years, I was under the immpression he actually cared. I am here on my own and required sedition. I would have to change my appointment dates due to a ride. Their requirements, I always kept in touch with his office staff. They were the best, If I had an issue thay told me ""Not a Problem""
My last appointment as I was waiting for my ride, I received a text reminder telling me about appointment details, I said to myself PERFECT I will be early as I always did. I arrived around 40 min. early. I went to check in and much to my surprise they said I was late. I showed them the text, They said I shoud have known to be 1 hour early. I dont read minds. I was told to go home and the office will re-schedule me. I called and they said I am no longer a patient. For a doctor to change your ability to want to live due to all the pain I am in? I dont know how he can sleep at night I dont know!!!|Waited over a month to have my case reviewed and was then told I would not be taken on as a patient. 19 months ago I broke my neck in 2 places causing pinched nerves and c-spinal stenosis, then 15 months ago I was rear ended at an almost stopped position on 225 by a Jeep doing 70+mph. I have Epilepsy and with the increasing pain, I am now having a seizure a week, while prior to my pain increasing over the last few months, I was only having a seizure once every 2 months.

When I politely told the receptionist that the Dr. should re-evaluate how he decides which patients he accepts, she immediately got defensive and rude, then abruptly hung up on me.

Unprofessional, discourteous, rude, and no sense of urgency. Save yourself the stress and time, find a different doctor.|Like many others my PCP sent over a referral almost month ago. When I called to inquire about it the person on the phone was very rude in telling me that the Doctor is reviewing the referrals and said they would call when they call. In the meantime I'm out of medications. I have chronic pain due to a blood clot in my head. I'm the last 4 weeks or so I've lost 15 lbs because the pain in my head makes me nauseous with no appetite. I'm on a written warning at work because I've called in twice due to pain. But clearly these people don't care because it's not happening to them. I don't understand? If you can't get to a referral in a timely manner you could at least let people know so we can start the process over with a Doctor's office that might actually care. I don't understand why you people feel the need to be rude.

Edit- my PCP did fill my prescription for a partial amount while waiting on a response. Sorry for the 1 star review. That was for whoever you have answering your phones. Your office staff is very rude as it's already been mentioned many times.|** I had not met Dr Brooks or any of his associates prior to seeing them professionally. I only have a professional patient-doctor relationship with this office. **

I have been a patient of Dr Brooks/Co Springs Pain Consultants for almost 2 years.

My previous pain consultant had retired so I needed a new pain specialist. I have a very complicated and lengthy medical history consisting of numerous of rare illnesses that most MD's are unfamiliar with.

When I fist requested an appoitment I was able to get in quickly.

My initial appointment was with a PA,  but I have worked with Dr Brooks, as well as his other PA/NP's. All have been professional and concerned about my care plan.

On my fist appointment I expected the PA to be a bit overwhelmed with the amount of medical information I gave her, but she was calm and asked approprite questions about illnesses she was unfamiliar with. She wanted to make sure that my care plan was working and I wasn't minimizing my pain because I was used to it.

The team at Dr Brooks' office looks at each patient as an individual , not just a diagnosis. They take into consideration how each diagnostic code is affecting my body (even if it wasn't causing me physical pain) and are genuinely concerned with how I am feeling overall, not just with my pain managment.

The entire team, from the front office to the PA/NP and Dr Brooks, are always caring, kind and attentive.

I meet with either Dr Brooks or one of his  professionals monthly. Due to being severely immunocompromised my appointments are typically Telehealth Visits, which I greately appreciate. They always contact me on time, having read the notes from my chart.

I do go into the office a few times a year. The wait time is minimal (typically I'm called back before I get my phone out !), and there are few patients in the waiting room. Once I'm in the exam room I've never waited more than 5 minutes for my provider.

The office building was easy to find, they have elevator access, and a good amount of Handicap Accessible parking.

The office staff is always cheerful and kind.  When I've needed to reach them in between appointments they typically answer the phone. If it's at a busy time they always respond to voicemail messages on the same day.

The office itself is clean and comfortable. The restroom is spotless. Inner offices are appropriately appointed, clean and comfortable.When I leave messages they are responded to within hours.

I have been very pleased with Dr Brooks and his Associates. I recommend them without hesitation.|About 10 yrs ago Dr Brooks decided I would not be a good candidate for his office as my other absolute WONDERFUL Dr moved so after reading the reviews I think someone was watching out for me. Thank you Dr Brooks. I have since seen an amazing Dr who has a very caring staff!!! And the staff really does make a difference. Maybe you should look for someone who is actually kind and treat the way they like to be treated. I'm pretty sure I learned that in kindergarten!!!!|I had a referral put in from my doctor over a month ago and called them a week after the referral was place.  The receptionist was unpleasant to speak with on the phone and gave zero information other than ""Dr. Brooks is reviewing the referral and will let us know whether your a good fit for us or not.""  Since it'd been a month and I still hadn't heard anything, I called them again today.  The receptionist was speaking so quietly at the beginning I could barely hear her.  I never caught her name because she didn't feel like she needed to share that apparently.  When I asked about my referral and if I could schedule an appointment, she gave me THE SAME ANSWER as a month back, ""Dr. Brooks is reviewing your referral and will let us know.""

When I asked what the timeframe was she responded ""We don't have a time frame.""

I pointed out that she's giving absolutely no useful information she goes ""that's all we are saying to patients.""

Talk about rude staff...and how can it take a month to review 1 file?

Hoping my primary care provider can find a better facility because this one seems awful and I haven't even been fully onboarded to them yet!",2025-01-17|2019-09-18|2024-12-27|2024-09-30|2024-11-22|2024-05-31|2024-05-03|2024-05-02,1|1|5|1|1|5|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",52|49.6|44.8,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Phone disconnected no more info available?","I called, got the office VM.",emergency_appointments|wheelchair_accessible_facility|accessible_wheelchair_parking|telemedicine_available|short_wait_times|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|convenient_clinic_location|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ744SkAdME4cR21CLb6-rugc,96

Ok, so they refunded to an expired FSA year which means they now don't have the money and I will never see the money. Not helpful, definitely lost money out of my pocket for services not rendered. I'm looking into what I can legally do here.

Welp, I deleted my review because the office account manager, Nikki assured me she would be taking care of it, it's been a month and there is no follow through or ""taking care of"" anything. I had previously been a patient that came to Mountain View Pain Center because my chiropractor moved to the location. He has since moved on from this facility. The new doctor, who has never looked at a radiograph of my neck or spine adjusted me on 9/19 leaving me in pain and unable to use my left arm for several days. He yanked on my neck, which wouldn't adjust because....my neck doesn't manually adjust due to my C4 being completely out of place, which this place would know if they took the time to ask. I purchased a punch pass for $250 for 5 visits, even though it turns out my insurance would be only $35 a visit so that's already a $75 overpayment. Nikki said she wasn't going to charge me for the 9/19 visit and agreed to refund me for the what would be $200 since I no longer want to use this facility for chiropractic. I had to pay another person to fix what this office did to my body, was never refunded, was overcharged to begin with and overall had a poor experience. I highly recommend not using this office.|Mountain View Pain Center has been really great in treating my husband after his accident. They have been flexible with our schedule and giving helpful tips to help him in his recuperation. Thank you Mountain View for being there.|What a complete disappointment. My husband has been in excruciating pain for the past decade and the physician wouldn't even give my ARMY COMBAT VETERAN (3x Purple Heart recipient) the time of day to meet with us. What a disgrace this place is and other than the receptionist, they spoke with undertones of racism in their eyes and words. Their website brags they're a comprehensive office, which was far from the case. If this is how you treat our veterans, maybe you should leave the state bc COLORADOANS LOVE THEIR VETS but this place clearly could care less about the patients and all about the money. Understand I am a 4th generation COLORADO NATIVE!! Pathetic excuses for a medical office and I pray they lose their licenses over turning an HONORABLY DISCHARGED COMBAT VETERAN away and wouldn't even give my vet their time.

- it took a week and a half of calling them daily and being told one thing or another to get a scheduled appointment. That included me going through the entire ""provide me your information"" process twice. That should have been my red flag to walk away but clearly my pain had me thinking wrong.
- I waited an hour in the office for my first appointment in which when I met the doctor he was wearing cargo shorts, a V neck T-shirt (with his chest hair hanging out) and a blazer. First class professional right there. Then he wrote a script to send over for X-rays.
- when I got to the imaging center, I got to hear an earful about how the script was written so poorly  that she couldn't even tell what she was supposed to do. Who would have thought we only got about half of the images that we're requested...
- went in for another appointment and the plan of action was to now do an MRI. I was told they would send the script to a new imaging center and I would get a call to schedule in 3-4 days once the pre authorization was completed.
- I sit here today.. two weeks later... on appointment day with no communication. So I reach out to cancel and explain there are no images to review. I'm told I could call the imaging center to schedule and they would re-fax the script... so I called... this is the real joke... they sent over my old xray requests to the old imaging center and still can't seem to figure out where the MRI script went AND the office staff tried to gaslight me into thinking it was my fault because I didn't speak up when she TEXT me about resending the script to the wrong place....

Dr. Verhey is an exceptional doctor who truly cares about his patients. During my visit, he took the time to thoroughly assess my condition and suggested a better approach to my treatment. Instead of continuing with ablations, he recommended switching to a caudal procedure, which turned out to be a much more effective and appropriate solution for me.

What stood out the most was how well he listened to my concerns and explained everything in detail. His expertise and genuine care made me feel confident and understood throughout the process.

The staff at his office are equally wonderful--kind, professional, and always ready to assist with a smile. The entire team creates such a welcoming and supportive environment.

I'm grateful for Dr. Verhey's dedication to patient care and would highly recommend him to anyone seeking compassionate and knowledgeable medical care. Thank you, Dr. Verhey, and your amazing team!|Dr. Verhey showed up. That's the only reason he got one star. His nonchalant attitude and bragging about his home in Scottsdale occupied most of the conversation during pre-op meetings. The whole spine care system didn't seem to communicate well. On the day  of the surgery an issue that was thoroughly discussed 10 days before hand, became an issue with the OTHER anesthesiologist. Surgery had to be cancelled. If the good Dr. and staff had glanced at my files before I had my IV inserted they would seen the problem before I was ready to be wheeled into OR. Bunch of crack pots trying to act like a university hospital in my opinion. 15 years of dealing with my back problems and this was absolutely the worst. Had the surgery done with CommonSpirit and it was done seamlessly. I will never step foot in a U of CO health facility again.|Perhaps due to the plethora of procedures he has done, Dr. Verhey appears to lack patience when people question a specific procedure's risks vs. benefits. A wee bit desensitized perhaps?

I firmly believe that on the morning of 7/16/19 I would have felt ok about my decision to leave the outpatient clinic had we parted ways on the previous note he uttered: ""It seems like you're not ready for this, therefore take some time to think about it and come back and see us when you are"" (not verbatim but that was the gist of it).

Instead, because I probably tried his patience by asking about the risks of particulate vs. non-particulate corticosteroid epidural steroid injections and wanted to know which one he uses (particulate it turns out), his demeanor went from general bonhomie to pettiness. He literally told me that spondylolisthesis is caused by weak core muscles. [I have spondylolisthesis L5/S1, stenosis probably caused by the pars fracture that occurred at some point in my life, and osteoarthritis of the spine (spondylosis).] At that point my mood flipped to one of complete outrage.

Anyone with a modicum of knowledge of this condition would know that it can be congenital and MANY athletes are afflicted with it. Do not tell me they have poor core strength, ok? That's absurd! I am still a lithe, 6ft / 147 lb, 53 y/o woman who can STILL touch her palms to the floor despite the pain (on a good day only)! I was an athlete and did all manner of sports to include squash, dressage, show-jumping, swimming, athletics,... My last stint was in 2017 whereby exercising just increased the pain levels instead of improving them despite incorporating strength training! I could do abs better than many of the members my age and even younger! I have good core strength. That was insulting to me! Made me see red actually. I guess he wanted to get me out of there, therefore resorted to a petty attack suggesting my predicament is MY fault!! PT, chiropractic, yoga, pilates ....I've done it all to no avail.

I lost all respect for him in that instant. So many doctors are arrogant. They don't know everything about every condition. Granted he is an expert on spinal anatomy, but not apparently about everything despite having had 2 transforaminal ESI procedures himself (so he said). What's wrong with your core then Dr.? The low blow was not appreciated. I won't be back.|Dr. Verhey is so warm and caring. I have had nothing but excellent care by him and his staff.|Dr Verhey and his staff are amazing!  Dr Verhey continues to explore options in pain management while battling insurance and Medicare.|Dr. Verhey and his staff we're amazing. Dr. Verhey  listened to me. He was amazing when I had the injection done. I couldn't believe how better I felt after 5 years of pain. I trust him.|Very professional,  Dr. Verhey has done a few of my steroid injections and I've never had a problem.  First time I had one I was very nervous but he calmed me down easily and now they're not so stressful.|Spent two weeks trying to schedule an appointment just to have the staff tell me that the service I need isn't provided by their clinic. You could have told me that when I initially called not after having me send the referral over twice, having the referring physical call and send over additional notes, and telling me that your office is busy so you will call me in a few days TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT AND WHEN YOU DID CALL BACK IS WHEN YOU SAID YOU DON'T PROVIDE THE SERVICE I NEED! Total waste of my time and now I get to live with this terrible pain even longer. Dr Verhey, your staff should be more organized and professional if you expect your patients to have confidence in you and your practice.",2024-12-18|2024-11-26|2019-07-17|2024-08-14|2023-11-09|2022-07-21|2018-03-07|2017-08-14,5|1|3|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJIfcEAq1PE4cROWuAB11qmnE,14

Dr. Fuller was very thorough.  The injections were well thought out and really helped!!!|I went here for a procedure in 2022 and though my procedure was fully covered by insurance (this was confirmed by both the front desk staff AND my insurance company), I'm still getting bills in the mail for it. On top of that, Dr. Fuller was very rude and dismissive to me and made me feel very uncomfortable both during the consultation and injection, but I believed the injection was my only option so I went through with it anyway. The extra star is because the injection did technically kind of work (offered some pain relief but wasn't perfect) and the front desk staff was very nice and friendly- I don't think the billing issue is their fault at all.|I have had back pain from sports injuries for almost 10 years. I was feeling hopeless and out of options. Then I found Mount Pain and Spine. Everyone in the office is so kind and helpful. They are always able to schedule in a timely manner. Dr Fuller is very helpful and always listens. I recommend anyone with back pain to come here!|I had a very disappointing experience with Mountain Spine and Pain in Highlands Ranch. I was scheduled for an appointment at one location but was not informed about a change in venue. When I called to let them know I would be 10 minutes late due to this mix-up, they assured me it was okay. However, upon my arrival, I was informed that I would need to reschedule because I was 2 minutes late.

While they admitted it was their mistake regarding the location change, their lack of concern for my time and situation was shocking. The service was incredibly unprofessional, and it felt like they truly didn't care about their patients. I expected more understanding and support, especially when mistakes are made on their end.

I do not recommend this place at all. If you're looking for a practice that values your time and well-being, I suggest looking elsewhere.|Dr. Fuller is one of the best doctors I've ever been to. He really helped me with my back pain, something I've struggle with for many years. I swear, he's a miracle worker. His staff is amazing, they are super friendly and professional.|I took my wife in to get checked out. Brian Fuller seemed like he had better things to do. He wouldnt even bother looking at the xrays we brought in. The visit was about 5min and maybe 2 with him. Nothing was done other than telling us to get more mri. Not even a recomendation on how to stop the pain. Then just left and pushed us out. Very  unprofessional and just didnt care.|I want to share how absolutely grateful I am for being referred to Dr Fuller! First of all you get an amazing group of compassionate and professional staff. The moment you walk through the door you are greeted by Baxter a super therapeutic amazing fur baby. I can't say enough about the experience you have at this office. I came in so messed up with arthritis, bulging disks to the point my life for the last four years have been in excruciating pain. I thought at one point I may need to have to always use assistive devices to walk. WhenI first met with the Dr. I had so many issues he took a very proactive systematic approach to working with me. It has taken several visits to get me back to a version of myself I could recognize again. I am walking without assistive devices any longer. Although not all of my pain is gone I am in better space than I have been for years. I even danced for the first time in years. I am so, so grateful for the help I have received. The staff works overtime dealing with insurance and get it done and approved. Please I want to let others know this is not just any other Doctors office. They can help you and you are heard. What are you waiting for. Get on the phone now and call them!!! Thank you Dr. Fuller and staff at Mountain Spine!!!|Dr Fuller is the best! He's always very courteous and professional.

You all tried to fix the issues by addressing my first review. Face the facts. You have no experience when it comes to autistic Black men and that's fine. But maybe you should get to know people outside of your small world, MVPC. You'll treat your patients like humans, instead of wild animals.

Was ""discharged"" AFTER I left the practice last week because for the second time, I was sent into a panic attack by one of the staffers. I did yell at the staffer to ""stop talking"" when I was having an autonomic reaction ( I have nerve damage). That is why I'm being discharged.

I would never recommend this place to someone in pain.

Try Joint Effort. They will get you moving again!|I was with you guys around 2 years. I went from  Giving 5 stars to 1 and this is my third time altering my review. I don't want to give a bad review. Staff is really great here. Physical therapist Joscelyn Kelly was amazing, I'll miss her and her help.  Staff was always really respectful and pleasant. Will and Celeste at the front desk, even Natasha,  clinic manager.  Even when I left the bad review the first time because I was in so much pain, I was angry. But I feel my chronic pain was often dismissed in the last 6 months,  Dr. Paull was helpful and felt he listened to me, my last,  final visit. However, When I asked for a small amount of pain pills for emergency pain, like 10, or emergency suppositories. He advised me to talk to my primary physician about that. While I try my best to be understanding. It Kind of defeats the purpose of having a pain specialist if I'm in pain and i'm not being helped. When I first arrived at this clinic I was given tramadol For emergency pain because I said it worked for me in the past.  I was given quite a lot and I even told my physician Who had left the practice that I didn't need that much. I took under my prescribed dose, I drive a lot for my job. And I work with children and the elderly. I also pass medication. I have to be on
My feet, Thinking clearly, And implementing behavioral programming.   Walking up to 12k steps, including lifting and being a single parent household my 2 conditions can cause me Severe debilitating pain due to physical exertion. I would be crying, Collapsing to my knees at work, In front of clients and staff and it's humiliating. This often happened at my last job. Even with a large amount of tramodol it still occurred. I could depend on that medication for when I was In agony take a break wait for the pill to kick in and then be able to go back to work and do my job and be a mom to my son.
I do know that staff didn't suspect me of abusing meds  Because I was taken off that medication cold turkey, With no side effects and I didn't even ask for more for months. I think this clinic should know that I have been bawling my eyes out several times a week from the amount of pain i've been in. I was sent home from one of my jobs because I was crying too much And I couldn't walk or even stand. I'm in a probationary period for another job and I think i'm about to get fired because of my pain. Driving is also dangerous.  I think the main reason i'm upset is because i've been scaring the hell out of my 8 year old son. He knows what endo pain is, And the amount of times I've had to ask a family member to come Get him because my crying and pain would not cease. Then my son would cry because he didn't know what to do when he couldn't help me. I know this is really long but i'm trying to make a point. While cyclobenzaprine,  Naproxen, Tylenol,  heating pads,  and lidocaine patches mildly help-
Any woman who Has ever had uterine contractions and electric lightning in their pelvis knows that those medications don't do Jack. Tonight,  I sat in a scolding bath for an hour crying.  800 Naproxen,  1000 Tylenol,  60 mg cyclobenzaprine 3 times a day,  which is WAY TOO much, but F**k my liver, I'm in pain.
And I just decorated myself in half a box of lidocaine patches.  And ate a 50mg edible.
Cannabis is very helpful but i'm not supposed to use it any of my jobs, Despite medicinal needs. If I get hurt
On the job and drug tested I lose that job.
I cannot use it or be on it While at work, Or driving which is mainly when I need pain management.   I'm not entirely sure what policies may have changed with this company in the past year but it feels so much more different than when I started.
I Just think it's important for the clinician management staff, And perhaps people reading the reviews know that I think this company has always been great,  but perhaps doesn't take endometriosis and Adenomyosis very seriously.|Don't listen to you. I almost lost my leg cuz they didn't believe I was in so much pain. And when I told them what works they argued that the knew better then someone who's living with the pain. They don't want to help people. They act like your trying get drugs cuz you ask for what will work for you. I had to go to different doctor who gave me emergency spine surgery after looking at my mri for 5 minutes and they were trying give me injections instead.

Not only do they care about making sure you are okay physically but they also stop to make the hard times easier.|Dr. Paul Castellini and Allie have literally given me my life back!

Dr. Paul is amazingly helpful and kind, he takes the time to listen and adapt a pain management approach for my individual issues.  Allie does all of the insurance stuff that I don't even understand behind the scenes so meds are approved and never delayed. And she answers or deals with every message I have left. This is by far the best practice I have been to. If you are needing help dealing with chronic pain, I highly recommend calling these folks and making an appointment with Dr Castellini! They have given me back my quality of life back and made me think anything is possible! Best team ever!!!

My insurance company advised me, per their agreement with the provider, I don't owe money as I wasn't told it was not covered (quite the opposite). They are still trying to collect, even though their agreement says otherwise.

I have woken up the past 2 mornings pain free! And I'm sure it is because Stasia has listened to me, worked with me to carefully unlock postural misalignments. The exercises are so simple and clear, it's easy to do them every day. I think those daily corrections are doing their magic. So grateful to feel like myself again!!!|Stasia has been incredibly helpful to me! Thanks to her, I can now sit cross-legged, something I haven't been able to do in years, much less comfortably! The Egoscue method has eliminated my plantar fasciitis and knee pain! If you perform the exercises consistently, you'll be pain free too.|I take the sitting Functional Motion class at Vita that is instructed by Stasia.  For the last two mornings when I got out of bed I felt like the top of my body wasn't attached to the lower part of my body.   I took her class this morning and feel whole.  It's an amazing class.  Thank you Stasia|I have been taking Functional Body Movement with Stasia for a little over a month, after at least 10 years of doing no exercise. This is the best fitness class I have ever taken!  Stasia is a wonderful teacher, she adapts every exercise for the varying needs of everyone in my class. I realized I had  more flexibility and range of motion by the third class. I have also started strength training and I realize that I'm better able to maintain safe form because of the FBM class. For the first time in my life, I'm aware of where my body is in space and how to align my body so it works better. I highly recommend Stasia!|I have recently experienced lower back pain and shoulder pain. Stasia was able to show me how my pain is a result of my hips not being in proper alignment. After just a few days of the stretches and exercises given to me, the pain had decreased significantly. I am now making these exercises part of my daily routine, feeling stronger and having more motion without the pain!|Stasia's Foundation Training class has really helped me.  I usually go to the chiropractor every two weeks.  I no longer have to go as often while regularly doing the exercises.  The other day I cleaned my carpets using one of the big cleaners you rent at the grocery store.  I am a few months shy of 70 and have had knee surgery in the past year.  I was certain I would be extremely sore the next day.  I did 30 minutes of Foundation Training after the cleaning project.  The next day,  I felt fine.  I highly recommend Stasia and The Foundation Training program.|I started going to Stasia about 10 months ago when I had constant neck/shoulder pain. Within a month or two it was much better and within 6 months I was pain free. I also regained the inch and a half in height I thought I'd lost dues to osteoporosis but obviously it was alignment and posture. When I pulled a muscle in my back this summer in tennis, I was able to exercise through it and it was gone in less than 3 weeks. The exercises take dedication but it is well worth the time in return for no pain and better appearance. Stasia is so great to work with, she makes you feel very comfortable.|While I didn't have any specific pain issues I went to Stasia primarily for a review/check up.  I had never visited her clinic before so wasn't sure what to expect.  Well, I was amazed at the results.  A week after my visit I went on a demanding hike (heavy backpack, steep and demanding terrain etc) and I truly had much more mobility in my hips (I'm 62) than I'd felt in prior outings.  Again, truly amazed at the improved mobility.

They made lots of money from my chronic pain with countless procedure and even prescribed a Fentanyl patch knowing the highly addictive nature of the pain medicine. Lied about how easy it was to get off the medicine. ""When you want to stop, all you have to do is come in once, take an oral medication and lay on the couch for a half hour."" That's a lie. I was addicted for years.
Finally I refused to simply show up and be experimented on. They would tell me that my procedures were approved by insurance, have me come in and do the procedure to only find out after the fact that the procedures weren't approved by insurance. So they decided to surprise bill me for and attempt to make me  pay out of pocket.
They then had me come in and attempt to have me sign an authorization for that I would agree to pay out of pocket for my procedures if they were ""later denied by insurance"". I refused to sign and then they attempted to say I was a No-Show for an appointment while I was standing in their office!!!!
I said No, I came in because you said it was approved but I'm not agreeing to pay for something that isn't approved. And they've been attempting to damage my credit ever since. I've now filed a complaint with the State's Attorneys General Office as there is ZERO chance I'm paying for a NO-Show when I was there but refused to play their games!
Never would recommend them! Thieves and liars. Have the phone records to prove that I called my office to tell them about the situation while standing in there office. No-Show, sure!|Dr Drennan is a great practitioner. He wants you to feel better and understand how he can give you a better quality of life from chronic pain. Great beside manner and all the staff have always been kind, professional, and courteous. T|Stood in the open air lobby waiting to pickup a client and heard an incredible amount of patients information.  Aren't there laws protecting patient confidentiality medically and personally?  I know where several people live, their birthdays, what they were being treated for, and how long they're going to be there. I was only here for 30 minutes.  There must be a reporting agency for this kind of trust breach!|Dr. Drennan and his staff Mark, Johanna, Sara and Kiana  were all amazing  great customer service...I worked in health care for 27 years and they are all first class in customer service ! Dr. Drennan has excellent patient care skills. My husband and I  are both veterans and were very impressed with him....he is very social and has a helluva resume for care. My back and hips feel amazing . My husband soon will get his injections. He got us in a timely manner so we can hike those amazing trails! I absolutely recommend this provider!!!!!|The treatment team is amazing and caring...

However billing is starting to become problematic due to insurance issues. They called me 4 days before the end of the month to tell me that they had to cancel my upcoming appointment 3 weeks out since they would no longer be able to accept UnitedHealthcare going forward. I find this to be highly questionable behavior, especially for a pain management clinic. A doctor's office knows months in advance when they are being dropped by an insurance provider. I did receive a letter from the doctor's office saying that they were having issues with UnitedHealthcare but nothing about stopping taking the coverage for existing patients. I happen to be lucky to have dual coverage so I could change insurance providers outside of the annual enrollment period but the other patients may not be able to pivot like I did to a different insurance company. There needs to be a better way to handle these changes considering that all of the patients seen by this clinic would have massive issues changing doctors with the rules surrounding the care provided by this clinic.|I had an appointment with a doctor that was no longer working there and no one ever told me until I showed up at the appointment.  I agreed to see someone else because I was having a pain emergency and the person that I saw automatically assumed that I was medication seeking (even though I had already said that I didn't want pain meds and all I wanted was Meloxicam).  I walked out of the appointment in tears and never went back.  Two years later, I started receiving a bill from that visit because they were out of network for my insurance.  I paid that bill and then a week later I got a call from the billing lady who said that I additionally owed $150 from a procedure in 2022 that was not covered by my insurance (even though they had submitted the prior authorization and it was approved by my insurance company).  The billing lady was rude and inconsiderate and I ended up having to pay the additional $150 with the office manager because I just couldn't deal with talking to the billing lady again.  I was fine having to pay for the original bill, but then to come back and say that I have to pay an additional $150 is mind blowing........especially since they didn't do their job in the first place because they were too busy judging me.  I will NEVER go back there and would suggest that you don't as well unless you want to feel like a medication seeker.  The doctor and the billing lady should really be ashamed of themselves.|I started seeing Dr. Drennan a few months ago and had my first procedure done here today. It was so easy! It was done so fast and proficiently and with a lot of humor. The attitudes and confidence were so helpful - absolutely wonderful and easy experience! Highly recommend going here if you have pain issues to address!|Dr. Drennan and the staff at this facility are the best I've ever come across. I've been in pain Management for more than 25 years.

Even when I've been in the lower mental states of this journey, the staff has made me feel heard and seen.|Avoid Mountainview Pain Center - Poor Service and Incompetent Staff

I had a deeply disappointing experience at Mountainview Pain Center, and I feel compelled to warn others. Their customer service is shockingly poor, and the staff is woefully untrained when it comes to pain management. It's clear they have no expertise in treating anything beyond superficial discomfort.

The so-called ""pain management"" services amount to nothing more than a halfhearted, light massage. The staff, though polite enough, are very young and lack the skills or training to deliver a massage that truly addresses pain. It's as if they don't understand the difference between a generic relaxation massage and one designed to manage chronic pain or provide actual relief.

If you're looking for real pain management or a skilled therapeutic massage, save your time and money and look elsewhere. Mountainview Pain Center seems more interested in offering gimmicks than meaningful care. Not only was this a waste of time and money, but with more than 7 attempts to get someone to call me back, and even being told EVERYTIME that someone would call me back, I NEVER received a call back.  To add to this, the most recent time I called I was answered by someone who could only text message people in the office and could only read me the results of their text (chat) messages.   This was a waste of time and, worse, left me feeling more frustrated than when I walked in.|I have been coming to Mountain View Pain Center since March of 2023 for Pain Mgmt, Physical Therapy and Chiropractic treatment.  This is my second pain mgmt facility since moving here in 2022, I have not had any of the negative experiences that I endured at the first facility.
Every person that I have had to work with at Mountain View Pain Center have been more than helpful,  thoughtful, kind, and full of useful advice.
I am very grateful for all of the assistance, suggestions and support from everyone at Mountain View Pain Center from the big beautiful smiles of the kind receptionists, very friendly Medical assistants and extremely professional and courteous medical staff..|Dr. Melati Steven's is an amazing acupuncturist and has helped my pain recovery tremendously.

After getting 3 cervical vertebrae fused earlier this year I decided it was time to find a specialist to help me manage my pain. I tried another provider in Thornton first but when she kept canceling my appointment I decided to find someone else.
I found Mountain View Pain Management in the Northfield area and now I see Kelsey regularly. When I come in she takes the time to hear how things are going from my perspective and I feel comfortable telling her everything about my ongoing pain problems.
At my first appointment I shared that my bio parents were drug addicts and I wanted to do all I could to break this pattern
So I tried quite a few different pain meds and a lot of them I had never heard of.
Well now I'm at the crossroads of deciding how to handle stuff because none of the meds were helping.
So now we've come up with a plan to go on the lowest dose possible of a strong pain pills and we will be checking in frequently to make sure that everything is going ok.
I'm glad that I came here and I deeply value the input from Kelsey to help me continue living a mobile life in my 50s and above.

He truly cares how you're feeling as a patient, doesn't make you feel judged that you need pain meds, is focused on what will make you feel the best and truly listens to your concerns, he is constantly on the forefront of new techniques and new options (ie stem cells) he knows the chemistry behind the medications he provides - how they interact, the best way to take them, which meds are better because they are more pure and better for the body; his office staff works so hard to keep the office running smoothly and in case of emergency will do everything in their power to get you in (i.e. I needed an emergency procedure scheduled and his office got me in the morning before he left for vacation, he came in extra early because it was the only way to fit me in the schedule). Although he no longer takes my insurance, his office does their best to keep appointment costs and procedural costs low, fighting for coverage when possible. I will not go to a different pain mgmt doctor because of the terrible experiences I've had with many many doctors - not believing my pain, throwing cheap meds at me that I know don't work, not upping my doses when they need to be, etc.). I trust dr. Bennett and his office with my life and would fly in from out of state if I had to in order to continue seeing him.|Dr. Bennett is a God-send in my life.  I thought I was going to be in severe pain forever.  But Dr. Bennett and I put together an action plan involving surgery, a TENS unit, and some medication.  It keeps me out of pain most of the time.  I am eternally grateful!|I have been seen in Dr Bennetts office since 1998. Same office for 23 yrs ,and for tr-germinal neuralgia (suicide desease). one of the hardest diseases to cope Without him I would not be alive today.I don't know what I would do if did have him. He is god sent.Thank u Dr Bennett. Rozanna|Everyone is caring and helpful. Dr. Bennett is very professional and cares about his patients. He has helped me so much with my pain and my back. I couldn't imagine seeing a different doctor.

Working with Kayla as my physical therapist has been great--she's incredibly supportive, and knowledgeable about all the issues I've been facing. My physical therapy plan was thoughtfully tailored to my specific needs and the level of pain I was experiencing. Highly recommended Kayla!!

I would definitely recommend this center to anyone who is considering!|The sad thing is, the people who work in the center I went to are great. The Billing people are incompetent clowns!

He definitely hires educated Physician Assistants. I know that walking into a 'pain management' office carries a stigma. ""Oh, you just want drugs"". Never did I feel that seeing his office. I'm in pain, can you help me? He isn't just handing out meds. He actually treats pain conservatively and uses in patient procedures. If you stick with the treatment plan you're going to get relief. The only reason I'm giving a 4 is because their phone system is a hot mess. He and his staff have a lot riding on the line. The people who use narcotics for fun ruin it for others who truly need meds to get through the day.|Technically, this a negative review. Even tho it requires you to select one star to leave a review.  Do not let Michael, the CEO, Dr.Gabriel, and David. Treat you.  I have Crohn's Disease, a Brain Tumor and a severally damaged low back l5 thru both si joints. I had previously come from the office that David worked at, that office when i asked to be placed on a lower dosage of pain medication, I was given something brand new. So that doctor took me from very heavy pain meds to something that was not even a pain medication. I was found unresponsive in a seizure and it took the ER to bring me out of it.
So, I found Dr Gabriel's office, the visits we're great as long as they had my insurance to keep running for injection treatments. Which last short term, week maybe two at most, then you have to wait till they say you can have the injections again.
In the mean time, David w Dr Gabriel's agreement decided to place me also back on pain medication, I did this for I believe only one month. THEN,  I decided I wanted to try to live w the pain, completely w out the pain meds. After consulting 7 doctors, I was told that in my condition (Crohn's that is severe and a brain tumor that is not controlled), that since I had been on the pain meds that I could not go straight off of them. The pain docs I called, the gp's and St.Ants and U.C. campus doctors advised I get a doctor to get a medication called Suboxone, (this medication is used two ways, for serious drug addicts on big illicit drugs and for normal people that live in Long term pain, but need to come off of the pain meds to let the body have a break) I am the second. I needed a break from the pain meds. So I think in September or October beginning of, I used the Suboxone and in 1 month was done w the negative side of taking your self off of pain medications(the withdrawal), three weeks ago, w my doctor's and family saying your in to much pain, go back on for a little while. So we drive an hour and 15 min to see David the P.A. he wasn't available for my appointment for some reason and my appt became w Michael the CEO.
So, we discuss that I need to go back on. And give a urine sample. All three knowing that I use CBD oils for the tumor and use one strip of the Suboxone one a month to settle the damaged receptors(it's like an electric uncomfortable feel, and yes was still getting that feeling after being off pain meds for over six months. Only reason I used it. So they have the urine. It only takes 48 to get the results, I am told after one week that it still was not back. Waited another two weeks for them to call me back, still nothing untill today. To which the CEO, mind you....calls my mother, I'm disabled so we live under the same roof, well anyway calls her not me. To try and explain that they no longer have any prescribers, and that David has been very Ill and they don't know if he will ever be back to work (their words). I listened to him try to explain why I couldn't come back in to be treated, short term on the pain meds. As I listened it became apparent that this was over them not getting to bill my insurance(Medicaid) for the big ticket items like my injections. They just don't make enough off of us on a Dr office visit and a script. I had all my doctor's/gp/GI, endocrinologists including the prescriber of the medication to come off of the pain meds my first time, tell me. Have your pain mgmt Dr call us. I asked that they do this, they refused.
This is yet another office that failed themselves and a patient. Please do your research, do not just trust that they are telling you the truth, or that they know exactly what meds to put you on, cause they don't, they shoot from the hip, guess...etc. If prescribed medication, research it. Research the doctor's. Watch what they are billing your insurance for sure. Understand that this is a business to make money from the pain your living with.
I can honestly say, I have never been so amazed at how horrible this office changed, and how they treat people. And document everything like I did.
, (r)|I couldn't ask for a better Dr. Office all the staff. From Dr Gabriel to David and all the nursing staff plus the wonderful ladies at the front desk are very helpful patient kind . and informative . everyone explains everything in detail . they are very on about what needs I need from my injection to medication they never push you to do anything you don't want to do they figure out what you need and what's best for you . and if something isn't working then they already have the next step ready for you .

They were professional, Polite, and did amazing work try them out!!|Absolutely love being here for accupuncture. Andrea is amazing doctor and has helped my life improve so much.|I spent about 3 months, two times a week at this facility for PT.  I had a very horrible experience and would not recommend this place to anyone that has any sort of long term chronic pain.  The entire experience felt disorganized, the different people I saw on a weekly basis where not on the same page or following the same treatment plans.  There were many days where I did my at home exercises and stretches, then went to my PT appointment and they had me redo the exact same stretches I had just done previously to driving there.  Many days it felt like a completely waste of time.  I saw no improvements throughout the three months I was there.  I had been told on multiple occasions about further treatment options, but then left in the dark for weeks about said options every-time I asked for information. After finally getting discouraged and saying something multiple visits in a row about how I'm not improving,  they did not listen nor did it feel like they really cared.  On the last visit I went to, I was balling my eyes out desperately asking for help, and I was told that the reason I'm not getting better is because I'm not taking my own recovery seriously and doing the work I need to be doing, which is completely false.  I broke down crying saying I didn't want to do this anymore, and they called the cops on me to try and baker act me.  Stay FAR FAR away from this place, it's absolutely horrible.  Months after the fact, here I am still in pain.

The worst part is my girlfriend worked here and was the person to recommend me pursuing this.  She explicitly asked permission to have me as a patient, nor did she have anything to do directly with my treatment.  After this situation happened, they used me as ammo to out right fire her even though she asked multiple times if it was ok.  Now I have to feel responsible for her losing her job.  This place is all about the money, and they want to keep you coming back weekly any way they can.  To give you an idea on how money corrupt this business is, they're currently outsourcing all of their behind the scenes office work to Turkey to save a buck.|My husband and I have been getting chiropractic adjustments here for some time. The entire staff are great! They listen to our needs, remember us by name and take great care of us. We recommend Mountain View Pain Center to everyone that we meet.|I needed a lot of work after an accident I had, my PCP referred me to Mountain View Pain Center because they can handle so much more than just traditional PT.  They have a specialist for everything, all in one location!  I see Atalia for my traditional PT, Larry and Alexis for Chiropractic (everyone needs to be adjusted, even if you don't think you do), and I have recently started seeing Dr. Andrea for acupuncture which is amazing!  She offers a private relaxing room w/ aromatherapy!  This location is large enough where everything is spread out, not cramped like typical PT offices.  There is a true sense of everyone there working together to get me the help I need for pain management.  There is no other place like it!  Highly Recommend.|I've come to the conclusion that this entire company is outstanding. I used to go to the Littleton location, but after that provider left the company, I had to see someone else. So now I see hunter at this location. And again, still amazing! They truly care about how you the patient are doing. Not how they believe you should be doing. I stoll recommend this company to anyone who needs all in one pain management.

Ps. I would have to bet that any of the ""bad reviews"" are from patients that either ONLY want pain meds, or violated the pain contract one too many times, so MVPC fired them as a patient. If you follow the rules set by the clinic, you will NEVER have an issue with anyone!|Good luck at reaching anyone at their facilities. You can't speak to anyone directly, ever. It's a circus. If you have an urgent question, need forms signed, need to reschedule or a prescription refilled it's a nightmare. They have a call center in Turkey that takes ALL calls. It's like trying to get through to NORAD. Terrible customer service management in my opinion. No real commitment to your patients. IF you're lucky, you can leave a message and they MIGHT call you back 3-4 days later. No joke. So, regardless of what response this review gets from MVPC, trust me. I'm being honest.

My referral to Dr. Hsu from an emergency room visit has been nothing short of a miracle!  My diagnosis was for a L4-L5 disc bulge and Sciatica of the left side.  I will be forever grateful to Dr. Hsu's knowledge of the pain I was experiencing and his thoughtful Plan of Attack as to how to get me back to living my life.  My initial Cortisone Injection helped take the excruciating pain down to a tolerable level.  I then received three rounds of PRP injections followed by several months of physical therapy.

My advice to anyone with my diagnosis is to visit Dr. Hsu and listen to his knowledgable ideas of how to make your life pain free, I'm happy I did!|Dr Hsu was so helpful, kind and fully explained what he was doing.

I've had pain for years! I'd Been to many facilities, none could help me. I heard raving reviews on Dr. Hsu and made an appointment. He listened to every detail of my pain report and asked questions with genuine concern. He made space for me to get in very quickly for specific diagnostic tests. Once he understood what was causing my pain, he spoke with his professional, friendly office team and they scheduled me within weeks. He explained every detail of my diagnosis and that he'd like to do an ablation. When in the O.R. , he talked me through each step and continued to ask me how I was doing.

He has always provided me with his excellent care and expertise. His nurses and staff  at Capital Pain Management are very kind and caring would highly recommend Dr. Finn And Capitol Pain Management thank you for your care always there for me|After being a loyal and no stress patient for 6 years Finn dropped me for having THC on my urinalysis AFTER he ok'ed it at my last appointment with him which my husband was a witness to and there with me. I use different products for Crohn's disease and he was fine with it if my gastroenterologist was which they are. Highly upsetting and extremely unprofessional. I'm assuming he never made a note in my chart that he himself said it was fine. They also never gave me any type of warning she just said the levels are supposed to have dropped on the urinalysis but why would they drop if I wasn't warned first!?!! All the lady on the phone kept saying it's in the paperwork you signed.. apparently he was standing there while she was talking to me and he said drop her...very unfair, unethical and it's Colorado for god sakes what does pot especially in medical form do that is so bad you can't mix it with opiates?! Ridiculous. Unbelievable treatment makes me not want to trust another dr. Save your time and go visit Mountain View Pain Management. Excellent ratings and very kind people! Willing to do more for me in my first visit than Dr. Finn has ever!! They couldn't even find my mri I had to track it down myself. He's also very arrogant and condescending.|'ve been seeing Dr. Finn for pain management, and I am incredibly disappointed.

Despite explaining multiple times that I am looking for natural, plant-based treatments like cannabis, the only thing Dr. Finn wants to prescribe are opioids. It's like they don't care about my personal health goals or my concerns with the risks of long-term opioid use or addiction...

I'm in pain and looking for a more holistic approach, but this doctor refuses to listen. It feels like he's just pushing pills without truly understanding or caring about what's best for me as a patient. I'm tired of not being heard. He will freely dispense opioids like a Pez dispensar and will get temperamental if you insist on him giving you a more natural prescription.

If you're looking for someone who will actually listen to your preferences and take a more natural approach to pain management, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. He gets paid to prescribe opioids.|In 16 months, I only got in once.  My script had to be renewed because the staff Never answered the phone or returned calls.
The scheduling rep who set me up over six months ago just wailed about how busy she was and how horrible it is to work there.
I just wanted an appointment.
When I met Dr. Finn, he was attentive and knowledgeable.
His office is truly the worst run office I have ever seen.|I have been in pain for over a year. In May I was in the Er. I couldn't walk for 9 days. I finally got a referral to see this so called spine clinic that Dr. Finn works at. I should have know better! Had to send this place 5xs the referral.  When you call you are sent to either TEXAS(customer service who can BARELY  speak English. They don't understand you) or Colorado.  Kaiser finally had to call them. Got in finally,  Dr. FINN maybe spent 10 minutes with me. His told me no drugs or injections just go see his friend who is a chiropractor. I have 2 bulging discs, 2 herniated discs,  and a disc that has moved forward. I have serve leg pain from L5. And now this stupid place says oh we don't take medicaid, so you owe us money.  This whole place is ran dirty. Now this place has kept me in pain extra for 5 more weeks. Health care sucks ! Shame on this place and the people who let this happen! Now I gotta drive to Denver from Colorado Springs and start over, yet again. Shame Shame Shame on you all!|I wanted to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for Dr. Finn and all the amazing providers at his office. The care and professionalism they provide is truly exceptional. Specifically, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Krykt, one of the nurses working with Dr. Finn. Krykt has been incredibly patient, always responding to my messages and ensuring that I receive the information I need. Her dedication to providing professional, compassionate care is truly evident, and I am grateful for the way she consistently demonstrates her concern for patients. The ease of communicating through messages on my cellphone and receiving prompt, expert responses from Krykt has been invaluable to me. As a veteran coping with numerous injuries and chronic pain, the supportive environment created by the entire team has meant so much to me. I am immensely thankful for the care and compassion provided, which has made a significant difference in my life.|I have on going back problems, and I have seen Dr. Finn for several years.  Dr. Finn impresses me as being compassionate and a good listener.   He has been a pain specialist for decades, and he is highly competent.  I also see Dr. Sonja Grifith, who is another doctor in his practice.  She is very friendly and highly competent as well.  Everyone in the office has worked there for a long time.  They all know exactly what they are doing, they can answer your questions in plain English, they do not give you the run around, and if they do not know the answer to a question, they will find out AND FOLLOW UP with the answer.   They too are friendly and helpful.  My experience with this entire medical group has been outstanding.|I was referred to this doctor through my network. Being new to the area I didn't know any better.

Kenneth was adamant that the only solution to my pain would be opioid treatment. When I asked him about a natural alternative for my pain such as a cannabis prescription he became snarky and short tempered.

My experience with this doctor is that he is rude and condescending.

I couldn't imagine a more caring and helpful doctor! He has given me all the time I needed each time we have visited. He has weighed in on some of my very difficult decisions with valuable insight. He has taken the time to read my MRI and X-Ray reports as well as viewing them with me, helping me to understand my condition. He has assisted me constantly in making appropriate adjustments to my medications. I'm just very grateful that I found him.|Dr.Smolenski has treated me for the better half 5 years. I was a mess. I have a list of injuries from my younger days that haunted me and had been on crutches almost 18 years.  I don't think I slept much of that time either.  Not only do I walk I can jump rope. I can say there are days I forget I was so bad.  He stuck with me got me moving then on to an exercise program.  i cannot thank Dr. Smolenski and his staff enough for the life I now have. I honestly thought at 52 I'd never walk or drive again.  I'm 58 and can take my granddaughter fishing!  Everyone there is Awesome.|I wish I had read the one star reviews (and there are many) before choosing this practice.
This medical office is broken and patients like me are paying the price! No response to calls, never answer the phone, no pain relief no diagnosis! A lot of promises!! They clearly care  more about the money made from useless injections I had already had than anything else. Kelli is rude and couldn't care less about people. Dr. Smolenski is nice but clearly too overwhelmed to run an office or dig deep into difficult cases. I've wasted my time, my money, insurance money and for what?
LOOK ELSEWHERE!|Dr McLaughlin-Abrams is wonderful.  She is kind and friendly and very knowledgeable.  She takes time to explain things.  She keeps an eye on my prescriptions (I have a few different doctors). I always have a pleasant experience.|No one EVER answers phones here, even when they give you their ""direct line."" It took over 2 months to make an appt date bc they may or may not return calls. If you can't answer their call, if they happen to call you back, get ready for a game of phone tag that takes weeks to complete (if at all). I can't even get anyone to answer phone calls to pay my bill!|Dr. Mclaughlin is AMAZING!  She is very kind and caring. She takes the time to listen to her patients and goes above and beyond to give her patients the best care. She is the best pain management doctor I have ever had. She has helped me so much with my lower back and neck. Kellie her Medical Assistant is amazing as well! She is always there for her patients. Kellie has helped me so much while being a patient here. I couldn't have asked for a better team to care for me. I am so thankful that I found Dr. McLaughlin. Thank you both for everything you have done and continue to do for me.|Don't base it just on your experience with the doctor. Unfortunately the entire office does not return phone calls after prescribing something that didn't react well they provided zero support.  Also, when we were at the office we provided the insurance and have continued getting bills that did not go through insurance.  When you call the billing number and leave a voicemail, no one calls you back. I have left 5 messages in just under 3 weeks with no calls back and no reprocessing of the bill through insurance.  I have even left a message with the appointment line trying to get someone to call back and no call back. Avoid this office they don't just don't manage phone calls or patient relations well at all.|Dr McLaughlin-Abrams is extremely pleasant! She clearly explained the whole procedure to me prior to the injection. During the injection she told me what she was doing and frequently asked how I was doing.
Kellie G, the MA, was also extremely nice and genuinely concerned on how I was doing.

My experience has been nothing short of amazing. Dr. Merkow listens and has offered me solutions to manage my chronic pain.

I would definitely recommend Dr. Merkow and anyone on his team.|Cant say enough wonderful things about Dr. Merkow and his compassionate assistant.
Perhaps one of the most impactful things we can do on life, is ease the pain and suffering of another. That is what Dr. Merkow has done for me (and i know for many others). His knowledge and kindness has helped me to have more joy in life, to be able to spend more time with family and friends, and participate in activities that were once a far off wish to do. If anyone is suffering, there is hope. When someone helps us alleviate our physical pain, we are grateful, but when someone aids in diminishing emotional and mental pain in additon......perhaps that is where some of the best relief resides.

I've been going here for the past 2 years, and still love going here. The only negative thing i would have to say is that the office is always extremely busy ...

Katie, the director of behavior health, could tell I was somewhat in crisis.  She went out of her way to help me deal with it, and I am doing a lot better now.  It became evident repeatedly that the people at Mountain Medical are more focused on serving people than they are in making a profit (although both are good).  Thank you Katie and everyone else at Mountain Medical.|I don't know what all the negative reviews are for. These were all the nicest people I have ever come across in a doctor's office, as a collective. Dr. Ellie wants to help. What more can you ask for. Very happy with my first visit and looking forward to more.|There's few doctors who know the true meaning of pain. There are few doctors I have found who will listen to you as a human without the god complex. I feel treated with compassion, warmth and guidance from my Dr. At mountain medical.
I have trusted only 3 doctors after over 11 spine surgurys that all failed. Other pain doctors rushed to implant or inject until I almost couldn't walk, one tied me down while injecting a needle into my tail bone while I had a no support between two vertebrae, he left me awake after telling me he wouldn't torture me knowing I had been through too much already. He lied to my face and could not keep injecting bone where hardware was in the way. I don't trust easily.
I have obviously been around pain management doctors in the state, One of the three doctor I trust is in Europe, leaving two state side doctors whom I've trusted completely in a 16 year journey... That should speak measures about my Dr at mountain medical.
I trust my doctor at mountain medical. She's a gift to not only her patients but to the world. I beleive if I ever feel addiction I'm free to discuss without fear. I don't fear her in any situation. I trust completely.
The staff of nurses are all friendly, kind and extremely helpful. Natasha does an excellent job, often doing jobs of others.
If I could obtain a proper coded billing receipt I would have the full package.
All in all, I'd rather have a amazing doctor and nurse than worry over the billing an sometimes not professional front desk. I know how rare these Dr's are.|It's been a Wonderful, personable and healthy, caring experience...they care about their patients!

It has been a vast key to recovery in a general. I appreciate their honesty for my recovery plan set in play. It's important when you are a patient.

Thank you to the staff and Dr.s for true and honest advice to healing and going about my recovery, A plan to exceed to my best potential. They over exceedingly go out of their way to make my goals what's BEST for me. A personal touch. I most certainly recommend making this office a trusted and safe place for making yourself,  family member or friend comfortable with your health in their hands. It's important to them and yourself. Whether the care you need is simplistic or heavier health concerns. It makes me feel comfortable to know I can walk in the office and know what care I do receive, is THE BEST quality care I could request anywhere.

The recommendations of care have been Right on to what I've personally needed to be able to follow through with my progress in healing appropriately in a timely manner. The healing process is up and down... but in the end, it's the best choice for me and recommended to anyone in pain for various health conditions and concerns. They do indeed CARE about you as a person. And take care of your needs with a personable touch...as such. God bless them all. I will furthermore extend my patient status under their care until I've achieved my therapeutic goals. Baby steps, And will continue to follow through with their advice and guidance as directed. And To remain healthy and, if any more bumps along the way... I know they will continue to be there to guide my progress with any new developments. I'm flexible to the type of care recommended. I couldn't recommend a higher level of standard anywhere else I have received care.
That's what real Dr.'s do... CARE! Feeling comfortable and having an open line of communication and being honest is key to the proper care for any individual, any age or ailment...being able to actually have that, is a high above blessing!

They said Ihad to do a bucal swab I was fine with it because I knew it would be clean. I was still really upset the next day because that's a serious accusation so I went in n asked to see the computer and where it showed methamphetamine. Magically it didn't. So now my insurance just paid for a bucal swab I didn't need in the first place.The Dr I saw that day introduced me to CBD for pain n I could buy some from him but it had to be cash n I paid it to him not the Drs office. I don't even think it was noted in my chart. The next month I go back n this Dr doesn't even use CBD so I'm confused & apparently so are that because there's no treatment plan in place.

My first appointment i was pretty much called a liar... After bringing in my documents showing that i had back problems she then believed me. Since then, and after a complaint was made, she moved on to another company. The doctors that i saw after her were great and the staff was great. A year, or so, went by and when i went back in one of the doctors weren't there any longer. This was odd as that doctor, and staff, were great. After dealing with another new doctor we went over everything again and that's when i finally got some treatments. I ended up having a nerve burned so that i could live without pain, for at least awhile until the nerve grew back. This was all discussed, which was great! Unfortunately, the staff that was in the room with the doctor to do the procedure was another disappointment! I heard them cussing up a storm and were saying things that made me uncomfortable. After the procedure was completed and i got to see the people, that did the follow up with, they told me everything i needed to know and were passionate about what they did and making sure that i was ok. A year, or so has now went by and the nerve has grown back causing me pain again... So, i called to get a new appointment (2023) and was told that i needed a referral due rules being changed. I didn't understand that as i had been going there for, i believe, around 3 years now. I never had a referral any of the times i went in, not even the first time. Looking at their website i don't see the doctor there that did my procedure. They seem to change staff more than i change socks. I loved that they were helping, but i am 100% confused as to why i need a referral now, when i have been going there for years, aka an established patient, and need to be seen again to address the same issue i was dealing with. Due to all of this, i can't see myself going back, unless something changes to where walk-in patients are allowed again. This is 100% disheartening!|I do NOT recommend them. While PA Christie Troyer has been great, there is a huge disconnect between her and the admin staff. I have waited 3+ weeks EVERY time she has referred me for anything. (Edit to update that I've been waiting for several months now with no contact.)
Then I attempt to call and obtain the referrals and get either a voicemail box with no response after leaving a message, or someone saying they will call me back. Yet they never do. This has happened 3 times so far and has been a huge hindrance to getting better after a car accident. Here I am now three (6) months later, and nothing has changed for me because I have been unable to get the care I require. Stay far far away from this place!!!|Miguel is the only reason they have a one star instead of a zero. Miguel is the only that would call or say he was to forward messages. Messages were left with the medical assistant and she didn't call back either. When my husband first started going there, they seemed great. After the procedure 29 days ago, my husband has been in constant misery and pain. It is the worst headache he has ever had and said his eyes feel like they are being pushed out of his skull.  After calling several times and getting no response, even after his follow up telemedicine appointment, they said the best they could do was get him in in mid July. They would not make an appointment at that and said someone would call. My husband couldn't take it anymore and went the VA Emergency Room 70 miles away. Dr. Latch or any of the staff would not speak to the emergency room, so the emergency could treat my husband, because they didn't know the specifics of the procedure that was done 29 days ago.  Would not recommend to anyone! If you have a choice do not go there. I have watched my husband suffer for almost a month.|DONT GO HERE!!! I have a personal injury case and have been trying to schedule an apt for 3 weeks. This past Tuesday I had a consultation over the phone and at the end of that conversation I assumed we could schedule the apt for the following week because that's what I was told the week  before consultation was scheduled. After the consultation the lady over the phone says no your not aloud to schedule it yourself have your attorney call and we can set a date up. 1. How would my attorney know what dates work best around my work schedule or what I personally prefer? 2. My lawyer could t even get them to answer the phone and had to leave 3 different voicemails and still hasn't heard back. It's Thursday today and the people on the phone kept running me around saying we'll call you back we're looking into it. I then had to drive 30 mins to schedule an apt in person because I thought maybe that would work. It did not the staff in both suites where very condescending and I'm willing to work with me. I was running around the office with no idea of where to go. The guy I was speaking with over the phone all morning then told me in the office that the office I needed had been closed all day. IF YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD HAVE WAITED FOR THEM TO OPEN THE NEXT DAY!! Nothing about this place made me feel secure and I will not be scheduling my back treatment here!!! No one should!! They're closed at 11am on a Thursday?? Doesn't specify online and if you call they won't tell you. Very very very inconsiderate to someone in as much pain as I.|The staff are absolutely amazing!! Krykt is wonderful she always makes sure I'm good before during and after my appointments her Dr Massey and Dr latch make my visits so comfortable and memorable, I always get nervous because I don't like needles they relax me everytime!! I would recommend EVERYONE to that clinic I wish there were more stars I can give place is truly one of a kind with patient experience!!!|Great people, very nice and knowledgeable, I was impressed and I have spent my entire life getting banged up and recovering from damage.
So far so good, I'll know in  a week or so but it was a lot easier than I expected.
Thanks to staff and surgeons.
Looking back with a clear head now, they are terrific, I definitely recommend this great clinic.|Awesome experience!! the staff is excellent from Dr latch to Susan to Heather they're just very nice very professional!! they definitely know what they're doing! the clinic isn't here to give just medications they offer better remedies along with the injections ,they've hooked me up with a stimulator machine!! the stimulator machine has helped me out tremendously!!! I've been using it for just a week and it's the best thing  that they have prescribed so far !! they are a great great place to go get work done  for your back and whatever else ails you I highly recommend them!!|They really need someone else answering the phones. Every time you call you have to leave a message and get a call back from the same person, once he calls back you can barely understand him and then he doesn't know what he is doing. I've asked to speak to someone else for a week now, and never get a call back or transfer. When I called to ask about my referral getting to them his response was ""ya we got it but we just do it tomorrow not now"" (this was around 3 pm so still enough time left in the day) I was told 2 weeks ago that they take my insurance, then all of a sudden today that's not the case. I would highly recommend getting a new person to run the phones.",2020-10-06|2023-11-16|2023-06-29|2023-09-28|2023-04-14|2023-02-20|2021-03-11|2023-06-22,1|1|1|1|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,telemedicine_available|long_wait_times|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJwbbB9vNFE4cRbKFbvxA40_s,83

They never answer the phone they don't call people back the staff there are so incompetent.

Let's get them shut down|I'm very happy with the clinic where I go for trigger point injections and medication to treat degenerative disc disease in my neck. Shannon is a caring and competent provider. I'm seen within 5 to 10 minutes of arrival.|Edit: gone from two star to a one star review now. And here's why.:
I don't really appreciate how the ""owner""has responded to everybody else's negative review, but not mine. This is what happens when pain clinic start to make a lot of money and they realize that they don't really have to give a crap about their patients quality of care anymore. 

I was about to give 5 stars before my appointment this week.
I've been going here for about 5 months, and it was great at first. But when I walked in there yesterday, something was amiss.
First, the guy who usually checks me in wasn't there. The lady filling in had her back to me checking out another patient, and I wasn't even greeted when I came to the counter. She turns around and is just like ""are you checking in""?  No ""hello, how are you today?""
The warmth and friendliness that was once here is now gone.
So, anyway....I've always liked my provider....until today when I asked for a med increase (a whole 2.5 mg mind you ) she basically insinuated that all I was doing was popping pills for pain and not taking any Epsom baths or doing exercise or anything else that might help me.

She didn't ask me what else I do for my pain, she just assumed and instead, she begins talking about how she has ""patients who won't do anything but pop pills and won't even take a Tylenol if they don't have their opioids, blah blah blah..."" as if I'm one of those people. 
This was very much unappreciated, and frankly, it pissed me off, because I've never ever abused my opioids, which I have been off and on for the past 30 years, and I do many other things for my pain besides just pop pills.
Instead of asking me ""Hey, China Cat, what else are you doing for your pain besides popping the pills and using the film I give you?"" But no. Instead, I just got a lecture on how her patients ""misbehave"" with their pain meds.
In the waiting room, there is an absolute overabundance of aromatherapy in the air.
This is something new I've never smelled before, and I hate it. I am fragrance sensitive and it gives me headaches.
Fragrances and aromatherapy don't belong in doctor's offices!
The country music blasting in there is not cool. I don't wanna hear country music when I go to my doctor, not everybody likes country music.
The new ""Late Policy Change"" is kind of  nasty, too. ""ZERO TOLERANCE""? Like, don't punish your entire patient base because SOME PEOPLE can't be on time.

I read this while I was waiting to be checked out. Lady had her back turned to me again. I stood there forever. I walked into the room where they do the UAs and asked the two workers back there if I needed to test, said I'd been standing at checkout and wasn't being helped. They acted all pissy, no smiles on their faces, rude...like I was BOTHERING THEM.
I don't like the general attitude here anymore. I'll be seeking out a new provider now.|Worst practice ever  horrible staff very rude they don't care about their patients   I emailed the manager and looks to me he's no good either  I mean shows what kind of practice your running if people keep complaining  about Melissa rockhold and how rude and uneducated she is in the field and he still keeps her  there might be something going on there.  if you experienced  bad service here contact Medicaid and the medical board|I love Vicki and Shannon.! They are very intelligent and knowledgeable about what they do! I would highly recommend them to anyone that is in need of the best  care!! The other Doctors are great as well! The staff here has always been so professional and has always answered any questions that i may have. When you walk into Open Arms the waiting room it is very clean and comfortable  and i love the way it is decorated!! Very welcoming! Highly Recommend!!|Open Arms Pain Clinic is by far the best Pain Clinic I have worked with. Shannon is so knowledgeable and thorough. Without Shannon I wouldn't be starting to finally get my life back. Thank you so much for what you do! I highly recommend this Clinic and especially Shannon!|They are horrible and inhospitable, they charge you for things they know your insurance doesn't pay for. I A male supposed to be office manager walk into the room with me and the doctor knocked and just walked in. My pants could have been down no respect at all. I will be reporting them to Medicaid.

Spoke with Medicaid, if ANYONE has a complaint with this pain management please contact Medicaid. Let's get a better practice in place|We do not understand why Jennifer was let go.  She was compassionate and kind with referrals to excellent physicians for diagnostics and outside care.  She was great with injections.  If you did not help yourself, she was quick to let you know in a stern but encouraging way.

Her greatest quality was allowing you to cut back on medications when you were doing well, because you knew you could increase them if and when you flared up.  That little bit of control, in a situation where patients have no control over pain, gives the patient mental freedom to feel progress without the fear that it might backfire if and when they might need an increase.  This positivity can actually reduce pain both physically and psychologically both by the joy of hitting a milestone and reducing medications on your own as well as by removing the tension and the stress of wondering ""what if I have a flare on this lower dose.""  Without this relationship, if you are struggling at home and desperately need additional help, and waiting for an appointment knowing that if you ask for help you could be ""let go as a patient"" or not taken seriously, then not only are you dealing with horrible pain, but the tension and stress make it even worse.

Jennifer had a talent for reading patients.  She could tell from swelling, knots, heat, upcoming operations, and high BP when someone was in trouble.

I respect in this drug-seeking world that physicians have to be responsible, both for themselves and their patients, but some situations are clear-cut.  Some patients are honest and put everything on the table.  When a patient who is full of pride has to beg for a temporary small increase for a week or two, just for a few hours of relief so that they can get moving and start to improve, and yet they are denied, it is embarrassing and humiliating and they start to feel less than human.  I miss that trust that I had with Jennifer.  She just seemed to know that not everything is textbook. and by giving me that respect of having some flexibility in reducing my own meds or (rarely) asking for a small increase to get through a bad flare, I was able to stay even-keeled while I am going through the process of having operations.",2025-01-16|2025-01-20|2025-01-20|2025-01-20|2024-03-28|2024-10-22|2024-10-25|2024-08-08,1|5|1|1|5|5|1|2,,,"10 a.m.|2 p.m.|11 a.m.",74.4|74.2|73,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","is cannabis ok?","Yes as long as it's from a dispensary",short_wait_times|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJce2vlLxPE4cR-RjRUggeW0I,93

I wanted to warn others about my experience with this particular practice. Unfortunately, after seeking help from numerous doctors and exploring various avenues for pain management, this was my final attempt at finding relief.

Dr. Jan Gillespie-Wagner and Darci Rossitier were Dismissive and Uncaring. During my appointment, the doctors I encountered displayed a hostile and aggressive demeanor. They failed to consider the impact of my chronic pain on my daily life. Furthermore, they seemed quick to dismiss my concerns and stereotype me as a patient, rather than listening to my specific experiences.

They were apathetic towards atypical pain. The most concerning aspect was their lack of understanding or apparent disregard for my non-typical pain condition. Instead of offering help, they were dismissive and pushed me away as a patient.

A Broken System: It's disheartening to realize how many people suffer at the hands of these medical professionals who are supposed to help. This experience is just one more example of how the current system fails patients with non-standard conditions. DO NOT GO HERE. They will stereotype you from the start and then don't listen to your situation.|I would like to thank Dr. GILLESPIE AND HER TEAM. You are all an exceptional example of what it means to care for those of us who are suffering daily. Thank you for making my life more full.Your kindness, understanding and empathy are greatly appreciated!|My physician referred me to this doctor and sent in a referral. When I called to make an appointment the receptionist was very rude and asked if my doctor had followed the procedure for referral. Like I should magically know this. Then she didn't explain the process or how long it would take to make an appointment. I called back over a week later and they said that my case might be reviewed next week. I asked how long it would take and she said 2-3 weeks. The second receptionist was somewhat friendlier but getting information on their process was like pulling teeth. I don't know that I'll go there is I finally get accepted as it's just intolerable to deal with type of treatment particularly when you are in chronic daily pain. I suggest that their receptionist tell folks what the process is upfront in a kind and respectful way. It would save folks a lot of time. Including them.|Dr. Gillespie, and her staff have been the answer to all of my pain management needs!

Dr. Gillespie is a no nonsense, punctual, thorough doctor!
Dr. Gillespie and her staff are highly qualified, and make sure all your NEEDS are met, with dignity, and discipline! You must be ready to be proactive in your pain management journey, by doing medical procedures, along with medicine!

Thank you, Dr. Gillespie, and staff you have all been absolutely perfect for me, and my NEEDS!|It  took me nearly 30 years and three states to find a pain doctor who could help me.
Dr. Jan Gillespie in Greeley, CO.  is worth the years it took to find her.

Chronic pain is so unique to every individual and requires a wide array of alternative pain treatment options.

Kent Bath|My wife and I both had appointments at Spine One, and we were both treated with the utmost respect. The entire office was a pleasure to work with from the front desk to the X-ray tech. We couldn't be any happier with this provider.|I had a horrible experience and most certainly won't be back. First, my appointment was at 7:30am but everyone was in a staff meeting until 8am, so I waited for a half hour to be seen. I had to explain my injury to three different people: the check-in nurse, the student, then the doctor. All separately. Across those three people, I was asked straight away if I'd like to be prescribed pain medicine four times (two times by the doctor). Then at checkout, they said I owed around $800. I told the checkout person I had already hit my annual out of pocket with my insurance and I shouldn't owe anything. She insisted I did, I verified with my insurance and offered to show her my policy but she declined to look. Then she said that she ""refreshed"" her page and verified I was correct. As if I'd hit my out of pocket max somehow seconds earlier (it was actually months earlier). I was already sketched out when the insurance coordinator called a few weeks later, the day before the surgery and said that I would owe around $800 for the surgery! I went through the whole out of pocket max thing again, and asked her to call my insurance to verify. She said ""we don't do that"". I told her to cancel the surgery and all future appointments!|Now that I've experienced nearly every department of SpineOne I feel confident in my rating.

He is professional, caring and compassionate. He spent 90 minutes with me on my first visit. He asked me a lot of questions about my health history and my habits. He spends quality time with me at every visit. For this, I am very grateful to him.
Dr. Reish has done more for me to provide relief for my migraine headaches than any other Doctor I have ever seen. He will not stop until he finds the right medication for you. He has been a blessing for me, and he will be for you as well.  It makes a huge difference to have someone who really cares and listens.
Gloria O. Arvada, CO|I had my first visit with Dr. Reish and it was unlike any experience I've had with a doctor to date. To be able to sit and talk with someone about my migraine experiences for an hour was so incredibly helpful. I felt like he was really interested in helping me more than anything else. I didn't feel rushed out the door after five minutes like so many other doctors. I felt like he really wanted to help me understand what was going on and how to work through it. What an incredible luxury to have so much time with a doctor fully focused on you. I know it costs him a lot to be able to spend so much time with patients; even if he were to cut his session time in half, I'd still feel way more taken care of than my experience with most other doctors.|I've been seeing Dr Reish for over two years for issues that he always helps me with, including migraine and hand and wrist pain.  He never seems to be rushed when seeing his patients and gives all the time needed to each person.  Besides the comfortable atmosphere and care, Dr. Reish is a most excellent and brilliant Physician and Osteopath.  He sees each patient holistically and so treats them with a wide variety of modalities.  I wholeheartedly recommend him for all medical and pain issues.|Dr. Reish is an extraordinarily caring and empathetic doctor. He listens to all of my concerns, and spends time in each session adjusting the places where I'm not in alignment. He has set me up with services that help my pain (icold therapy, compression stockings, SI belt) that I would never have thought would be covered by Medicaid. I've consistently been impressed with the level of time and care in our sessions. I've recommended him to my friends, and would recommend his practice to anyone with chronic pain issues.|Dr. Reish is the 9th headache specialist/neurologist I have seen.  My migraine headaches, about 4x/year started in college sixty years ago.  They persisted until April, 2013, when a far worse, debilitating headache began.  These start each day about 8:00 a.m. and last all day.  I have been prescribed more than 90 different medications and numerous devices and ""treatments.""  None of these have been effective except opiates, which are successful for only a short time - until my system builds intolerance to them.
In April, 2023 I was referred to Dr. Reish by a physiatrist at UCHealth because he determined he couldn't help.  Dr. Reish really ""hit the ground running,"" with a thorough initial exam, followed by Botox injections.  The injections were not very effective so Dr. Reish prescribed a medication usually used to treat opiate dependence, Buprenorphine.  For the first time in 10+ years my headache pain is blocked and one dose usually lasts all day.
Dr. Reish is.a very dedicated, thorough, caring physician who listens and evaluates carefully, then prescribes the treatment he feels is best.  If that doesn't solve the problem, he doesn't hesitate to try another treatment.  I highly recommend Dr. Reish.|I have been a patient of Dr Reish for several years now and I am very grateful for the care I have received. He is always very accommodating when I am in need of immediate care to manage my migraines. He has also developed a very solid medical plan that manages my pain and migraines day to day. He has truly changed my life allowing me to function in a way I was unable to for many years.|Dr. Reish is a caring physician who listens to you and actually cares.  He has a great bedside manner and has no agenda other than improving your health.  He took a thorough medical history and truly listened to me, unlike some other docs who don't spend enough time with you and just give you medicine.  I totally trust him and would recommend him to others.|I have been going to Dr. Reish for over five months and could not be happier with my experience. He is truly one of the best physicians I have gone to see. He listens and treats every symptom and takes the time to look into current research to help find the best possible answer. I have never had a physician who works so hard and diligently, always explaining what he is doing and why he is doing it. He presents information and treatments in an unbiased way, letting me ultimately decide what I want to do for my body. His staff and office provides a warm and inviting atmosphere, I have never felt uncomfortable. I could not recommend Dr. Reish more highly as a doctor.",2023-08-31|2023-02-01|2018-12-20|2019-01-03|2023-08-23|2020-01-11|2019-01-29|2019-01-02,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ4XDD_njta4cRKn-0bNzgF4k,27

They addressed the root causes and provided RELEIF and PEACE OF MIND!  I didn't need surgery or a lifetime of pills after all!  So many aspects of my life have improved thanks to the Pain Cure Clinic.

This course was definately money well spent.  Just what I save on co-pays alone makes it worth it.  :)|Many years ago my wife turned around when I started to read the books of John Sarno and my lower back pain which at the time was really a problem went away.

Now that other chronic pain has returned  I am getting a lot of help from the pain cure clinic
They take the work of Dr John Sarno and improve on it in many practical ways.|BEWARE  of joining this.  You WON'T  get your money back if you still have pain in 3 months as they advertise.  They aren't qualified to be making TMS  pain decisions for people.  Just two people who read all of Sarno books and say they were cured of pain.  I reported that I still had same headaches after 105 days and business owner denied me a refund because  ""I went past the 90 days"".  Shyster business.  But do read John Sarno's books.  That's all you need to do.|I used to be a dancer in college but I had suffered a horrible injury in one of my classes that has caused me chronic back for the past four years. I've seen so many specialists and massage therapists and nothing I've tried has had lasting results. I thought I would never be able to dance again and my back pain has subsequently lead to crippling anxiety and depression as a result of being in too much pain to dance or even work out. When I found Pain Cure Clinic last December, I was skeptical at first, but willing to try anything to get my life back! But with the help of John and Laura's amazing coaching techniques, I am now pain free. It is such a relief to be able to dance again without pain, and I am so grateful to John and Laura for their help. I would highly recommend Pain Cure Clinic to anyone searching for relief, whether you're suffering from back pain, fibromyalgia, or any other chronic pain disorder.|For years I've suffered with anxiety and multiple chronic pain, I've seen multiple doctors, an all seemed to be showing me no results on the caused and how to prevent this from happening daily. I asked my doctor's about Dr.Sarnos books and they told me that it was not what I needed to these problems. Howevebi had felt like it was worth the try these books lead me to an online search where I found Pain Cure Clinic, I decided to try out this practice and see if there way of handling things was going to work for me and I'm so happy that I did not listen and went and check them out for myself the people who worked here were great and very helpful. I was there for two days learned so much more then I had in years dealing with these problems and I can honestly say the Pain Cure Clinic is the BEST thing that's ever happened to me. I can now say I'm in apsolutely No Pain and that had a positive effect on my anxiety and the things I was shown here help me stay this way months later HURRAY is all I can think. I highly recommend this office.|I did not receive value from this program.  I was impatient and eager to get started on my TMS, and this seemed like a great way to accelerate my progress, but instead it set me back.  I wish I had waited.  There are so many great resources out there - books, videos, blogs, FB support groups, etc, and I am doing well because of those.   This program is very expensive, and I did not feel that they provided anything unique or any information that is not available elsewhere.  They are very clear that they are not trained medical or mental health professionals, and I don't feel that what they do justifies such a premium price.  I highly recommend you spend a $100 - $200 on books, watch relevant videos, etc and give yourself some time to do the work before you consider investing such a large dollar amount (plus travel) for this program.   You can improve on your own!  April 12, 2019 - I feel I need to update my review based on the clinic's response.  What business replies to a negative review by trying to discredit a client who paid them a LOT of money?  It's upsetting to me and my family that they would be willing to say things that are completely not true or were taken way out of context.  It's also extremely unprofessional to bring up personal information about a client in such a public forum.  I know the actions I am taking, the dedication I have to working through my TMS, and the improvement I have made so far - they don't.  Even though this program was not a fit for me, I am so happy to be on this path to recovery!|Suffered with Fibromyalgia for years with no help from medical doctors. But the two days spent at the Pain Cure Clinic really helped with pain levels.|I actually worked with Dr. Sarno before he retired.

The staff here is very courteous and Dr. Malinky has been very helpful. They answer any questions I ask them and help put my mind at ease about procedures that need to be done. Good care is hard to find but luckily I found it here. Make sure you are early for your appointments because they are usually booked a few weeks in advance. Late is late, no excuse can change that, and no they cannot just ""squeeze you in"" because that would be disrespectful to all of the other patients they need to see. Being polite and common courtesy usually goes a long way anywhere you go. Anyways, I like Dr. Malinky, he seems to genuinely care. Same with the nurses and staff, I really appreciate everything you've done for me so far!|I went to this man after my spinal fusion surgery when I was in my early 20's and he was extremely harsh and rude right from the start and I was a very good patient, compliant, helpful, didn't take meds too early, and he never became any nicer. He was just a nightmare and straight up disrespectful. I am putting this out here to warn everyone thinking of going to him. I think his stars already speak for themselves.

Thank you.|I had a procedure and the IV site became infected. They said they it would be tight, but they could fit me in 2 hours later. I told the girl if it's a problem I could go to Urgent Care. She said, no come on in. Well my husband got in an accident just before this phone call and luckily the car worked, he just had to put the donut on. Well we tried our best to get there on time, but we didn't realize just how bad the traffic was going to be, with very icy roads, driving on a donut. I ended up being 12 minutes late. The girl at the front desk told me the doctor just took his last patient and since I was late, he would not see me. I explained about the accident, driving on the icy roads on a donut, and the traffic being slower than usual because of the roads and she said oh well, you'll have to go to the ER. I explained to her that I told the girl on the phone that if it was so much of a tight squeeze to get me in, I had no problem going to Urgent care. She just shrugged her shoulders. Things happen that are out of our control sometimes and would it hurt to be kind, considerate, and sympathetic? I missed work to get there as soon as I could. Their nurse caused this infection in my vein when she gave me the IV. I suffered enough, they could have been courteous and saw me. Especially, the day before Christmas eve when getting into a doctor was near impossible and the infection getting worse as each moment passed. It would have only taken a couple minutes to see me.|Dr. Malinky is incredibly caring and a brilliant doctor.  He has a very calm demeanor, which I suppose other reviewers have mistaken as uncaring, but they are wrong.  He is very passionate about helping people, and is a great diagnostician. I drive an hour and a half from home to see him even though there are many pain docs much closer. He is the best of the best!|I saw Dr Malinky for maybe 3 minutes.  I paid a $60 copay for 3 minutes.  I was then told to get an MRI.  That was it.  Now to get the MRI I have to pay another $600.  Dr. Malinky didn't discuss anything else with me and didn't offer anything else like a steroid treatment or an anti-inflammatory treatment, nothing.  What a waist of $60.  I have already had x-rays.  I don't need an MRI.  I need to get the inflammation down.  I just got off the phone with them and they say it is standard practice to order an MRI.  Well, if that it true why don't they just order one before you have to pay the $60 just get introduced to the doctor.  What a rip off!  For anyone looking to go there make sure they order the MRI up front so you aren't out the first $60 and then have to pay it again when the doctor sees the results.  This is why medical cost are out of site!  Doctors that just don't care about the cost to people.|I have been going to Dr. Laub for the past 6 months. He has been really helpful explaining to me my condition and what options I have in long term treatment. I work in construction and have a demanding job that my condition has made really difficult living with. If it wasn't for Dr. Laub's caring attitude and can do personality, life would be so much more challenging and unbearable. I will be seeing him for many more years and would highly recommend him to friends and family.|Absolutely the best and most caring pain specialist I have dealt with.

I started with this clinic around 4 years ago and it was the best place you could go.  Dr. Siegel was an extremely compassionate and caring physician who never left out the human factor.  Then Amy was an absolutely amazing person who truly cared about your well being.  Combine all that with Stace Toye, a physicians assistant and it was as good as it got.  A while back it was taken over by UC Health, and both Amy and Dr. Siegel had left.  The entire nursing staff was new, and the entire place had a corporate feel.  Not a good feeling when it comes to your well being.  They brought in Dr. Gebauer and it immediately went from Caring and Compassionate to Corporate and Corrupt.  As soon as a Pain Physician loses the Compassion you should start looking elsewhere, even if it is a 2 hour drive each way as your well being is too important.  The new case manager who replaced Amy is Maria, and it feels as though she is just a Minion of Dr. Gebauer who can't stand her job.  This place has gone from top notch, to run like hell who not only treats you poorly, but also practices Unsafe and Unhealthy methods, and an ethics committee should revoke her right to practice any medicine.  I hate having to do this, but the unsafe practice needs to be known.|Can't get appointments correct.|",2024-09-09|2022-01-09|2023-04-28|2024-12-11,1|1|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointments recommended",,,injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|pain_management_services|extended_hours|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|board_certified_physicians|multiple_locations|friendly_staff|rude_staff|good_doctors|experienced_doctors|insurance_accepted|flexible_payment_options|cash_credit_payments_accepted|comfortable_waiting_area|short_wait_times|medication_management|surgery_services|wheelchair_accessible_facility|free_parking,,,,,,,,,,ChIJIdtuWa1uQocR6kjXno81MjY,4

They lied to me when they said they were in network with my insurance I asked them multiple times to confirm I was in network when making the appointment and the day of the appointment. I spent 3 months to get the bill reduced then they disregarded the the arrangement and turned it over to collections. Now they just scream at me over the phone when I call. I did not get the procedure I went in for and if I would have I guess I would be on the hook for thousands. I have spent untold hours dealing with this one Dr. appointment and received absolutely no benefit from them.  They got my deductible when I checked in. In my opinion they should reimburse it to me much less coming after me for more.|My daughter & I have been seeing DR Ross for 2 years now. We have never had an issues with him or his staff. His staff is top notch especially all the nurses! He explains everything in detail. Not sure why some had bad experiences but we need to keep in mind that he is a human being not GOD or a miracle worker. He does what he is skilled to do nothing more. If the procedure works then great, if it doesn't well it just doesn't. That should not get him a bad rating! Moving locations yes there was a huge delay in getting back to me, but that was because of the new building and new phone line. Just keep calling until you do reach them not the end of the world. My 1st RF worked wonders for 9 months the 2nd did nothing. The nerves do grow back & can even become worst. This is out of his control. My daughter is a competitive gymnast who has Bastrop Syndrome. He praises her for doing it for so many years and dealing with that pain. He unlike most doctors said to her "" I cannot tell you to give up the sport you love however that will the best way to fully be pain free"" he genuinely told her I will do everything in my power to make you have a successful season and he has! She says he is her angel! She tumbles now with no issues. Is it a permanent fix? absolutely not. But then again, there is no procedure that is 100% Shantusha is absolutely great, she is always on point with getting our authorizations & quickly schedules us. My daughter went in for her procedure & one week later was all smiles at practice, not a single back pain. She wanted me to tell him that her 1st meet went beautifully & that she came in 3rd place all around. She's ready to rock & roll. We won't see another Doctor here in the springs that's for sure|I had a procedure with Dr. Ross on April 19, 2021. This procedure was to see if the injection would work. The procedure however did not work it made the pain worse and now I have numbness in my feet. reached out to the doctors office About the numbness in my feet and the excruciating pain that im having in my L-5 and S-1i was transferred to his nurse she left him a message because he was on his way to a meeting that was on April 21, 2021 still hadn't received a call from the doctor so I  reached  back out to their office to learn the doctor left the nurse  a email to tell me to go to the ER. This doctor is definitely not connected to his patients I have switched doctors through my TRICARE. . I explain to the nurse that the doctors job is to check on his patients not send you an email and because of that result I am switching doctors and I have done so please stay away from this doctors office because he doesn't care about the patients he only cares about the money. I feel as though since the other procedure that he wouldn't be doing since the first procedure didn't work he's not gonna be getting as much money so why connect with the patient I'm just a number not a patient this now explains why he's at a 2.3  in reviews|Doctor relationship with myself was apparently not that of a good one. I recieved a letter to separate services from me due to receiving pain meds from another doctor which was my primary care for other issues and at said time Scott wasn't giving me appointments but every 3 months. I would never recommend him to anyone.
He wanted to keep giving me infections when doctors in Texas had said i needed surgery and had been through all injections needed to prove this.
This is his 2nd time doing this, they are very unprofessional and wait time with scheduled appointment is always longer. So they get a 1 from me. If you want to give your money away do so but i warned you. This is my personal experience Ann's i approve this message|I had a procedure on Monday morning and was told to call that afternoon with a pain rating! I tried to call at 4:10, got no answer! This is now Thursday afternoon and I have called several of the extensions to try to talk to someone, approximately 14 calls, and not one return call! I was under the  impression there was to be another procedure in a week! I don't have any way to confirm this! All I know to try now is to drive 40 miles to the office and walk into the waiting room to try to talk to someone! This is not acceptable care in my view, and I can not recommend this clinic for anyone!!|Dr. Ross is a very meticulous, caring, professional of the highest caliber. He's taken care of my issues with attention to detail, and has been able to cut my need for medication by 50% through radio frequency ablation. I recommend him without reservation.

She hasn't seen the dr. yet, but the office personnel has been absolutely amazing.|Very heartless cold group . Don't care about you personally you are just another body to control .

Dr Knopp is very knowledgeable and patient. I never feel rushed and he answers all my questions. I have felt very comfortable and confident with any injections he has given me. And Erica Falger has been such a tremendous help to me. She remembers her patients, is very personable and relatable. She cares about the patient as a whole, physically and emotionally. Pain can be very exhausting and depressing so it's nice to know someone is looking out for you. She also takes her time and makes sure she reviews everything with you and answer any questions. I have trusted her judgement/recommendations with different things she has tried to help my pain, podcasts and books she has recommended. You can tell she truly cares about her patients. The only downside is the wait time for appointments. It can sometimes take a couple of months but I don't mind the wait knowing the expertise and care they provide. Thankful I was referred to their office :)|I have been a patient since 2010. The place used to be good, but it has gone way downhill. Before COVID, it took two to three months to get a procedure such as an injection or to see a doctor. Patients are left to suffer in the meantime. After COVID, things really started to go into decline. Now, I understand that the doctor may have had financial difficulties because of COVID, but haven't we all? That shouldn't be taken out on his patients. Several good providers have left since due to internal BS. The staff is way overburdened. If you leave a request for a prescription refill, it can be up to four days before the staff addresses it. This just doesn't work if you have a medication that the pharmacy doesn't typically keep in stock, and there is no pharmacy in town that will order it ahead of time without a prescription. The office won't let you request your medication more that a week ahead of time. But, if they don't handle your request until days later and it's a Friday, then the pharmacy can't get your medication in until Tuesday, and you're screwed. The unfortunate thing is that this happens often, and the staff just doesn't care. I do understand that the problem lies somewhere in management, because the problems here persist no matter how much the staff changes over. But, it's even less of the patients' fault then it is that of the staff. There is no reason to be curt with the patient when he (or she) has a legitimate complaint. Once upon a time this place could say they were elite. But, no matter how elite the staff may be, there are so many deficiencies that it doesn't show.|The unprofessionalism and neglect from this establishment is disgusting. To be met with hostility when asking a simple question is uncalled for. Also, prescribing an epileptic patient a seizure increasing opioid is nothing but criminal. Someone will be held accountable.|Zero stars if possible. Severe pain for months and have been waiting on my spinal epidural for 4 months while in pain to have them cancel the appointment last week last minute and tell me they can't reschedule me until April. How is this ok? Im in pain.|The trigger point injection I was given made my pain worse so I had to go to an orthopedic surgeon who was very confused about the injection's location. Insurance didn't cover much of the visit or injection and I just received an additional bill six months later months after paying my balance.|Beware of this office.  It is not a part of Hartford Healthcare but a private office that is just affiliated with HHC.  It has all the signage and logos but it is really a private practice run as such.  I have been a patient through multiple back surgeries and found out this week that I need to find other pain management care because of a medical staff storage in this office.  They gave me pretty much a month to do this, which will be challenging because of the lack of pain management care in this area.  HHC has no pain management care in the Hartford area, which is a total surprise to me.  I got in touch with HHC and they also have no solution to this situation.  This is a disappointment to me because I was receiving quality care from this office.  I think Hartford Healthcare need to reassess its pain management care for its patient.|I am changing my review I wrote 5 years ago from a 5 to a 1, but I would give a zero if I could.

Here are a few of the many issues I had that caused me to leave:
-The clinical decision making stopped making sense. They would not refill a NON-controlled medication I had been on for over 5 years without me being seeing me in the office when I had just been seen 3 months prior.
-I had an adverse reaction to a medication, they denied that such a reaction was possible despite the medication having a black box warning. Also, I learned years later that the medication should not have been given to someone with my health condition, which I was not made aware of.
-Against my consent, one provider gave me an injection in a location I said not to touch. When I asked him to stop, he did not stop. I left the office sobbing and was truly traumatized to return to the office.
-Patient identification issues: During that same office visit, I had 3 different people coming into the room thinking I was a different patient.
-Provider consistently coming into work late, making me late to work even though I was first appointment. Happened at least 3 times.
-When I brought concerns to the office manager Sue Staples, I was berated. When I mentioned I did not appreciate the way she was speaking with me, she asked me where I work, which was threatening and inappropriate.
-The office is poorly managed, poor staff morale. High staff turnover. They can't keep providers there happy. I know it is a hard speciality, but I have been a patient at other pain clinics that are able to safely and appropriately deliver care without these issues.

I switched to a different clinic and am much happier. Would not recommend|The Pain Treatment Center was  a vital part of my plan of care.  The office can not handke the number of patients. Most times, you are waiting a considerable amount of time for your provider when scheduled for regular appointments . The management staff is absolutely rude and unprofessional and will support unprofessional conduct for their subordinates, including the aprn's. There is no need for me to bash this office. My review is from experience and is an accurate representation of care received but not by all the physicians or staff.  The problem is that there are not many pain treatment offices/doctors that give epidural injection under light anesthesia as a part of their care I've found locally. Dr. Kost really needs to do more and be present to witness the level of unprofessional being displayed by management and ""some""aprn's.  This has been my personal experience
and is my review of my experience.  Doctors leave the practice very frequently, and I now see why most don't stay.

I have been looking into other alternatives to manage my migraines (trying to add to my treatment) and fibromyalgia. I'm trying the intravenous vitamins infusion.

It just sounds too good to be true. Well.....was I wrong!  Not only my did Dr. Turok sit and listen to exactly where my pain was, he also set up a treatment plan with me to ensure that after the course of treatment I would only have to come back for maintenance semi annually.  I barely walked myself in with excruciating back pain and I left with tears of happiness in my eyes, standing up straight in disbelief without pain!.

He treats you with gentle hands. when I leave there my pain is already gone! He is an excellent physician.|I've been struggling with chronic headaches for about 15 years, trying everything from prescription medications to natural remedies with little success. After starting IV vitamin infusions with Dr. Turok, my experience has been nothing short of transformative.

The infusion treatments are tailored to my specific needs, and I've noticed a dramatic reduction in the frequency and intensity of my headaches. What I love most is how quickly I felt relief--often after just one session. However, I do them on a monthly basis to keep my headaches at bay and I do love that my immune system gets a boost every month. Dr. Turok is incredibly knowledgeable, taking the time to explain the benefits of each vitamin and how they can help address the root causes of my symptoms.

Since beginning these infusions, my quality of life has improved significantly. I no longer feel like my headaches are controlling my day-to-day activities, and I've gained back energy I didn't realize I had lost. If you're dealing with chronic headaches or just want to feel better overall, I highly recommend giving IV vitamin infusions a try with Dr. Turok. It has been a game changer for me!

Thank you Dr. Turok for transforming my life and allowing me to live headache-free!|I was a patient of Dr. Turoks' 3 or 4 years ago, in his Wallingford, CT. office. This time I saw him in his Ridgefield, CT office. Both are warm and comfortable with plenty of free parking.

Both my physical therapy (several months now) & medication regimen (same as the past 20 years) were set to continue to improve my quality of life since my spinal injury amongst others have completely ruined said quality, health & mobility.

I was planning on getting a brace as soon as the practice begins fitting them as I am in dire need of assisted posture correction, thus further preventing spikes in pain.

All of this progress gets thrown out the window as soon as at one appointment (whilst everyone else was busy/on vacation), I get stuck with the new guy who decides he wants to upend the set treatment plan & go with what ""he sees fit"".

After this appointment, I had an extremely foreboding feeling (also realizing I knew him from elsewhere with a similar condescending/unpleasant experience) & asked to NOT be scheduled to see him under any circumstances, insisted on only seeing my usual two doctors, David & Eli.

Appointment comes up on 7/31 (I had to book weeks past my normal once a month as only the new employee was available otherwise), I come in & against my wishes I am informed that I will instead be seeing exactly whom I do NOT want to see due to scheduling conflict.

I should have just rescheduled to see David/Eli upon hearing this but didn't think of it as all that was now on my mind is overwhelming dread, felt like vomiting as knowing I'd have to deal with this guy was that bad!

After an extremely uncomfortable extended wait (45-60mins), a nurse I've never met calls me back....nasty attitude & look as soon as I sit down, not what I'm used to coming here. Usually I'm greeted by the same couple friendly nurses.

Oh not this one, exact opposite of the norm. Stares at me as if I just insulted her when giving my height/weight, didn't even bother with vitals. Great, someone with an axe to grind & chip on the shoulder.

At this point I decided it would be a good idea to get my phone out & start recording as soon as the following interaction occured.....

She starts to grill me about why I'm there if I don't need a refill,  said ""It was filled yesterday, I'm just here for my required monthly follow-up"".

""Wait, wait, how'd you get this script?""
""As usual I tell the pharmacy I need a refill & they filled it, what's the problem?""

""NO, NO, NO...YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE!""

In strolls the new employee(the indian guy whose name isn't listed nor do I care to speak it), same condescending aura fills the room.

""You know you commited a felony, right?""
""What are you talking about?""
He's goes on driveling nonsense repeating ""You're lucky I don't have you arrested for this.""

Why all this nonsense? Riteaid had been sending refill requests to both my pc & their office, filling whichever came first. I explained  back in February this happens, no issue then. Only one was filled per month, nothing wrong there, never did ""anything illicit"" nor did I try filling both.

Regardless, he who shall not be named continued with the felon nonsense until I spoke up & said ""IF I DID ANYTHING ILLEGAL, CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW & HAVE ME ARRESTED!""

Nurse Ratchet says ""You have your script, go find a new dr before it needs to be refilled next month.""
It took MONTHS to even get the form 43/book an appointment here, clearly she either hasn't gone through this process (or more likely simply doesn't care) as you can't just magically go to a new provider in 28 days.

I again insist they call the police for the alleged crime. Once the door opened, both h.w.s.n.b.n & nursee change their tune to ""What are you talking about? Leave.""
I repeat the words on my way out, they play dumb.

Then the realization hits, new guy wanted me to look irrational for a reason to discharge. Knowing I'd raise a stink after being accused/told I'd be arrested, did just that then followed me out saying ""What are you talking about?""

Thankfully I have proof of the incident.|First off I would like to begin by saying. Dr Levy is heaven sent. He took the time to listen to my problems and discuss a treatment plan. I have been feeling and doing better since my treatments with Dr. Levy. Is part of a amazing team. From the first time you walk in the staff is outstanding. I've also had the pleasure of being seen by Betsy King! Her compassion gose beyond expectations. I have never had a doctor and staff take the time to relate to a patient. I will recommend this team to anyone suffering from chronic pain.|I want to thank Dr. Betsy for her kind and caring nature. She is always willing to listen and help in any way. She is a terrific Doctor.  I highly recommend her.|Even though the practice is new the team at the office had come from another company, and have been together forever. I was a patient of theirs as well, at the other office. I love these people! The receptionist Fatma is great. Dania is one one of the Medical assistant and my favorite. She has a great personality and is professional in her job.  The APRN'S and PA's, Beth, Betsy and Alison really have care about the patients and are great at what they do. I am so happy Dr. Levi went back into private practice, and brought his team with him!! I have been a patient of his for about 12 years. He is an amazing Dr. I would highly recommend him and his team for pain management!! They really know their doing!!|Excellent staff.  Very caring and they do their jobs in a very professional but compassionate manner.  Betsy King, APRN is an excellent provider and professional.  Everyone that I have dealt with in the Waterbury and Danbury offices are excellent.  Dr. Levi is wonderful and I would recommend him highly.|Dr Levi is a rare MD! He is not out to write a prescription for your pain, he wants to get to the root of the problem or find natural alternatives to manage first and if that does not work then he will move forward with meds or procedures. One of the biggest problems I see in medicine is MD's just want to write the prescription, he does not do that which I think is admirable and ethical. Great bedside manor and super knowledgeable! You won't be disappointed!
As for office staff, they were great as well, very friendly, had no issues with appointments or payment.|De Levi is fantastic . He and his staff are great . Dr Levi tries to get to the root is the issue . Not just write a script and leave . He sits and gets to know you, takes his time no rushing . .. I been going for 5 years , highly recommend this office!|I have been cared for by Dr. Levi and staff for many years.  I have always felt they collectively truly care about every patient.  it is evident in the way they interact with me and every patient there.  I highly recommend this practice for pain management!",2024-08-04|2020-12-15|2024-01-18|2020-12-23|2020-09-09|2020-08-27|2020-09-08|2020-08-27,1|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot",,,medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|pain_management_services|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|convenient_clinic_location,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ33x2ulPB54kRc5utnEx9NEk,38

Ms. Mary is compassionate, knowledgeable and dedicated to patients. The whole team at Total Pain Treatment are wonderful people. They chose health care and accurately as they all do care.
Highly recommend coming here.|I can't say enough great things about Total Pain , Dr. Mary and her wonderful staff! I think i am on the road to managing my pain well. They truly want to help you and I appreciate that so much. I look forward to seeing everyone monthly. Thanks so much, Dr Mary!|Mary Colburn APRN and her team are kind, compassionate and professional. They are exceptionally organized which makes the entire experience stress less.
Mary Colburn APRN is the paragon of providing holistic care. Her assessment is inclusive of your pain experience and the impact on your personhood. I cannot express enough how grateful I am to be her patient.|The reviews are accurate. From the moment I walked in I didn't feel uncomfortable or anxious. The front desk staff and the dr's and dr assistants are all honestly amazing. Being a pain patient you don't find many dr's that have empathy or compassion. This place is all of that. I was treated with respect and not made to feel bad at all. If you need a new pain mgt I suggest giving this place a try.|The moment you walk in the front staff is amazing! The MAs are so wonderful and the drs there take their time to understand you and your pain. The wait time isn't long at all and everything is very professional. I would highly recommend anyone to go here.|I've been seeing Dr Colburn for about a year now, and I can't say enough good things about both her and all of the staff at her office. They are in all seriousness the sweetest and most genuinely caring support staff I've ever encountered. They follow up on calls and emails promptly, call to remind you of your appointments, and are just generally pleasant to interact with.

I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen. I have never had an issue with my medications. I literally drive 45 minutes from where I live and still spend LESS time overall than at my previous pain clinic because I spent so much time waiting and trying to reach someone to straighten out problems with medications, often suffering medical withdrawal due to errors on the part of the clinic staff and doctors.

As for Dr Colburn: she's fantastic. She's no nonsense, and expects you to follow the clinics rules- and as long as you do, she will make sure you have what you need to live your life. She's clear, direct, organized and honest. She doesn't overbook patients, she knows your medical circumstances because she doesn't pawn you off on RN's, and is organized and just on top of things.

Overall I'm just really impressed with this office, and plan to stay until I no longer need pain management. They're so kind, so organized, so professional. And they have a clinic cat named Whiskers who I just....I love him.|So this is my husband's second visit here I said I would do an update and here it is The place is very clean , as soon as you walk in your greeted with beautiful smiles from the staff everyone is so welcoming and very friendly they are genuinely kind and very attentive to the patients. Mary is very informative on different things to help with all aspects of pain and treatment which I absolutely love, she is very friendly and respectful and works with her patients not against them. Melanie fixed so many issues we had with the pharmacy and went above and beyond and made sure to take her time so my husband didn't have to get frustrated and worry all weekend she made every step stress free and left us with our minds at ease that was definitely something new and appreciated. The entire staff is just so different then what we have ever seen from a pain management treatment center and I'm so grateful for this establishment and the kind of genuine love they have for their jobs|I have been struggling to find proper pain management for many, many years and I have finally found an entire practice of professional care givers who go above and beyond to help their patients achieve a far better quality life in a well rounded way of total care, meeting needs and being heard. They are up front, no judgement and more than happy to provide the much needed help communities everywhere are seriously lacking. This practice is setting the standard of care bar way above the rest and making a huge difference in the lives they gladly touch daily.

I can walk, stand, sit, and lay for longer periods of time and sometimes with no pain at all. She understood my pain and is helping it, unlike this other clinic in West Haven (no names) that treated me like a drug addict in my intake interview, though I was never on pain meds before in my life. I can now prolong my surgery as I desperately needed to. I'm grateful.|I am a health care provider and have been one for 2 decades. Unfortunately, I have DJD in my lower back, worsened from a fall. I was on gabapentin and flexeril, that's it, and I needed a provider to fill my scripts. I Like the NPs, they respected my request as I didn't want/nor can I take any opioids chronically. The ""owner"", a masoginistic jerk, ""Ben"", was dictating how often I needed to come back. They make you follow up at frequent intervals, and since my regimen is ""stable"", I graduated to a 2
Month follow up. There was an issue with my script because the refill allowance was ""0.87 refillsz"". I thought it was an error and the APRN approved a 2 month supply. I called ""Ben"" asking if my rx could be changed, he said ""no you have to be seen since it's a controlled."" I said, ""OK BEN! Check the quantity that was approved because 2 months was APPROVED!"" He refused to let me speak to the provider, moreover, you can't message them directly in the portal. This guys is such an ass hat-very misinformed about what ""controlled meds"" are. Flexeril is not controlled, in CT, gabapentin is NOT controlled. He is arguing because it's prescription, ""it's controlled"". Prescription means it is dispensed by a provider and dosage and monitoring is managed by the provider. To date, gabapentin is not assigned a schedule (check the CT DPH Consumer report from September 2020, ITS NOT CONTROLLED!! BEN!"" Moreover, when you do intake, HE looks at your previous records and decides if you would be treated. He's not a MA, LPN, RN, MD, PA or APRN. I don't know where he thinks he is qualified to render care. An owner doesn't extend you licensure.He looks at your insurance to see if it's cash cow-seeing how many unnecessary visits he can squeeze. Also look at the state attorney lawsuit from 2022. He was named in a fraudulent insurance scheme to overbilled patients' insurance for UNNECESSARY visits-the state mandated he pay $1 million dollars back for fraudulent billing.He holds ""your prescriptions hostage"" until you make another appointment. The chewing tobacco  habit is disgusting too, likely an OSHA violation. There are other pain centers out there, I will say the  NPs were helpful. Patient beware!|The male receptionist is plane out rude and disrespectful. The provider Sandra Charles don't listen to the patient. She gives stuff that affects someone's mental health. I honestly believe she's racist. I will be making a report to the state of Connecticut. I refuse to return to that practice. Trust me on this if I didn't have to press a star I wouldn't have. If you deal with chronic pain and have mental health issues stay far away from this pain center.|Each time I call, receptionist are rude and don't even answer with a greeting. Yall gotta remember you are the pint point person for patients, the company, etc. that goes for everyone who walks in that place too. Each time I speak to either the girl or the boy, they both throw me off and I haven't even gotten in to book an appointment. Smh I hope to see different energy in person. Yall hiring just anyone fr no value or compassion when talking to patients. And yall represent all those who suffer from chronic pain?? Clearly if we getting referred to this business, we have that bit of joy and excitement. You guys are just killing all energy and hopes that we're gonna actually support and REAL help from these physicians.|I've been coming here for about a year and I only have positive feedback. Because of them I can live a pretty normal life, I can spend time with my wife, kids, family, and not be in pain like I used to be. You hear people complain about certain people and in reality when any medical facility that deals with RX Pain meds they have to be strict as well as follow government guidelines and regulations. They care and they want to make sure that they help as many people as possible.|This place should be reported to the state. The man who runs the place is extremely rude and difficult to deal with. I waited 2 months to get an appointment there and as soon as they saw my file they said they couldn't help me. They had my records prior to my appointment.  They could have saved me a hour long ride,the pain of getting there and I'm turned away. I asked to at least talk to the doctor. The doctor,a woman,sta rted off being polite but then saw my file and told me she couldn't do anything for me. Total waste of time and a whole day of pain,someone took a day out of work to take me...the place also was dirty ,had dirty looking people in the waiting room. Everyone was complaining about the wait. It was a terrible experience and I left in tears,literally, running down my face when I left. I've had chronic pain from multiple surgeries on my back and they act like Im not crippled...I am disabled now and they did Nothing to help me.|By far, THE WORST pain management facility. Benjamin is a rude jetk and wouldn't even schedule an appointment for me to speak to a doctor.|Sooo. I called to get help. Whoever answered, answered like i was bothering them. I was referred to this place from my primary care physician because she understood that the ""pain"" medications I'm on are having severe side effects and that I need to be on proper pain medication. The moment I told this person one of the medications I was on, because it doesn't work for my pain issue and I'm weaning off of it, INSTANTANEOUSLY they said, ""we don't prescribe narcotics!"". I never asked them about narcotics so don't assume! I consider that very rude since this person was NOT a doctor. Now unfortunately, like way too many of us, we have to jump through hoops just to attempt to getting help. These doctors don't care if people don't get help with chronic pain management and get prescribed proper pain medication and that the un-aliving rate will just keep going up. What is the the point of a pain management place if after all other routes have been tried that an opioid will finally be put on board? This is why there are pain contracts. You mess up you're done. Simple as that. These doctors take a Hippocratic oath to DO NO HARM. Without being open to all choices you are doing a disservice to the patient and causing harm mentally and emotionally. I can only hope one day they take a long look at themselves and reflect and understand that statistically a small percent of people that they turn away without even being listening to have most likely been forced to the streets, in jail or u-alived themselves. Very sad indeed. We all know that if they were chronic pain patients they would be saying the same as us all and crying for help.",2024-11-13|2024-12-15|2024-11-01|2024-10-28|2024-08-03|2017-12-11|2024-09-25|2024-03-19,5|1|1|1|5|1|1|1,,,"11 a.m.|10 a.m.|12 p.m.",55.714285714285715|54.285714285714285|52.285714285714285,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","does this place do pain managment??","Yes, but make sure all your scans up to date",pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJIZn2uVXJ54kRa-Tjx-PWViI,113

He has quickly become one of my favorite physicians, and I've been so impressed with his care that I referred my son to him as well. Dr. Pervis has been just as amazing with him, providing the same level of attention and compassion.

In today's world, it's rare to find a doctor who truly listens and cares, but Dr. Pervis does exactly that. He takes the time to understand your concerns, works diligently to identify the root cause of any issues, and ensures they are treated properly. He is not only incredibly knowledgeable but also kind and thoughtful. My only complaint is that I wish there were more doctors like him!

His staff is equally incredible--friendly, professional, and attentive. It's the complete package! This office has created an environment of genuine care and dedication, making it a shining example of how healthcare should be. If we had more people like Dr. Pervis and his team, the world would be a much better place.

I can't say enough about this pain management office. They set the standard for excellence in care.

Unlike many others, Dr. Pervis has never been dismissive or made me feel unheard. Instead, he goes above and beyond to make sure his patients get the care they need.

Thank you, Dr. Pervis, and your amazing team, for your dedication and compassion--you are a rare gem, and your efforts are deeply appreciated.

Update: Dr. Pervis just resolved another issue I've been dealing with for over four months! He went above and beyond to do what other doctors were too lazy to address. His commitment to patient care is unmatched, and I genuinely don't know what I would do without him as my doctor.

Dr. Pervis and his team, thank you once again for everything you do. Your hard work, kindness, and professionalism don't go unnoticed, and I'm so grateful for you!|My experience was very formative and very well taken as far as the best process for my care continue to encourage.

He is extremely knowledgeable about pain and pain medications and always has my best interest in mind. He is empathetic, compassionate, and encouraging. My frequent visits with him keep me motivated to keep seeking out any all treatment options and to still have hope. He treats me like a human rather than a condition.

I'm one of many who go to her for chronic, nagging headaches.  She ALWAYS sits down with my husband and I to discuss my treatment and to make sure that my quality of life is comfortable.  The entire staff is extremely friendly and I find the environment in her office to be welcoming.  To be cheerful.  I've been going to her for years and have recommended Dr. Patel to others who suffer chronic pain.  They too have raved about her.  I'm enjoying watching her practice grow, as her dedication and commitment amazes me.|Dr. Patel is one of the kindest and most astute doctors I have ever seen. She has been so incredibly helpful to my healing by addressing issues I have struggled with for many many years. She is able to offer innovative solutions and treatments, and spends considerable time thinking through diagnoses and options. My pain and fatigue have been considerably reduced and I have been able to greatly reduce the amount of medication I was taking. My quality of life is so much better for having become her patient.|I have been a patient of Dr. Patels for around 20 years or so. I began seeing the doctor when her office was in Newington, where she helped greatly with my back issues. (Spondylosis, stenosis, herniated discs, etc.) She left practice to raise her family, and, in that period, I saw 4 other docs, none of whom helped much at all.  About 5 years or so ago, I was looking for a new M.D. and I saw online that Dr. Patel had returned to practice. I immediately made an appointment and have been much better ever since!! I can't thank her enough for all she has done. A couple of years ago my wife also went to see her. She had 3 back surgeries in the past but was still in pain. Dr. Patel has helped her as well, especially in minimizing that pain and maintaining a reasonably active life. The doctor is kind and caring, takes time to listen, and has a really good sense of humor. If you are having any issues with pain, you MUST see Dr Patel.|I completely 10,000% trust Dr Patel! She is caring, kind, thoughtful & a physician that actually listens to you. I will explain my amazing experience. I had a TFCC tear in my right wrist, which is my dominant wrist/hand. This tear was misdiagnosed by another doctor as a wrist sprain after x-rays did not show a fracture. He told me to get a brace from CVS & wear it for 12+ weeks. After 12 weeks it did not improve, in fact it felt worse than before. I tried this for several weeks after without any improvement. Time passed, nothing changed, no improvement in wrist pain. I had an MRI, scheduled an app with a hand wrist ""specialist"". He recommended cortisone, cortisone & more cortisone. He suggested if that doesn't work, surgery is my only option. I realized I need a doctor that is the right fit. Finally, I found my hero DR. PATEL, I wish I found her sooner. DR PATEL is AMAZING!! Her entire team is kind & understanding. She took the time to sit & listen to me. Everything about her is genuine & warm. I started to cry in her office. She gave me the hope that I no longer had, by the time I came to see her. We scheduled the PRP treatment date. Please, listen to her step-by-step instructions prior to the PRP treatment. What you do leading up to the treatment is just as important as the PRP treatment. Prior to the PRP treatment I had pain in my wrist from the moment I woke, it was relentless. I am at my 1-year mark after PRP, I feel great. I am so grateful for Dr Patel. I wish she could be my physician for everything. Other doctors should take notes from Dr Patel. She is spectacular!|I have been lucky to be an existing patient of Dr Patel's for years now. She is incredibly intelligent and extremely kind. She has helped me manage my pain so very well. Her office staff is all lovely. I highly recommend Dr. Patel|I cannot recommend Dr. Patel highly enough. I sought her help due to significant wrist pain after getting nowhere with an orthopaedist.

The ortho told me I was ""fine"" when, at age 42 and otherwise in good physical health, I suddenly could not lift a pan or twist open a door handle. The ortho prescribed physical therapy yet told me ""it probably won't help."" He basically told me whatever the issue is I will live with because he doesn't see anything wrong.

Dr. Patel took a different approach. She listened. She listened to me about my symptoms and reviewed the records from the orthopedic. Dr. Patel found what the ortho was not able to, diagnosed, and treated the injury with PRP therapy. I can say I am now 100% recovered thanks to Dr. Patel's medical care. That may sound like a corny line but it is the truth.

I have recommended family members and friends to Dr. Patel because she is a doctor who listens and thinks through issues instead of simply going by what the insurance/medical playbook says to do. She thinks holistically about the individual and the best way to treat the pain, not merely what insurance will pay for but what is best for the patient. Dr. Patel has my thanks and my support.|After a failed back surgery three years ago, I never thought I'd find relief for my lower back pain. Dr. Patel has changed my life! In a few short months, I have begun feeling relief after seeing her. No opioid treatment, which is exactly what I was looking for.

She was recommended to me and I have since recommended her to three others. She's the best! Thank you!|Dr. Patel is the BEST doctor I have ever met!! I am so Blessed to have met her and to have her support and care as I battle chronic pain for the past 20 years- I have worked with Dr. Patel for over a decade and each visit is new and her approach is planed and strategic. She doesn't just take you as a patient to treat your pain, she cares about your whole life and she goes above and beyond for us. I have never met a doctor that truly understands the impact that pain has on my life, she is thoughtful and she is puts so much consideration into every treatment procedure and/or recommendation she makes. She is not only the smartest and most skilled doctor that I have ever had, she is also very protective of our needs and ensures that every part of our treatment plan is implemented in a way that keeps the quality of our lives as the most important factor in our care. Her passion for the work she does is evident and I am very grateful to her...she has given me and my children a complete life that without her would not be possible.",2023-09-29|2023-09-21|2023-10-10|2024-01-21|2023-09-21|2023-10-02|2021-08-08|2021-04-08,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Identifies as women-owned, Language assistance, Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJIbhEbc6z54kRhvILnGbCnVI,55

He made my quality of life so much better then it would have been and for that I can put into words how grateful I am.|I've been a patient of Dr. Levi for almost 7 years. At times, I've had to wait a bit longer than expected, but I understood at those times, there's always been a reasonable explanation. Aside from the occasional emergencies (which is completely understandable), the other reason for the wait is due to Dr. Levi's caring and patience with his patients. I have NEVER felt rushed during my appointments. Dr. Levi has ALWAYS listened to my questions, and taken the time necessary for me to understand. He is professional, personable, and has a great sense of humor! Dr. Levi will remain my spine and pain specialist as long as I need his care and services. He is an A+ physician.|Great practice. Was referred to Dr. Levi by my spine surgeon several years ago and have been going ever since.  I see him and have gotten to know several other fantastic practitioners - Beth, Betsy, Donna - that have or do work for him. They are always attentive, professional, empathetic and responsive. Dr. Levi is very competent and up to date on latest procedures to help alleviate chronic pain issues, and all the practitioners listen and identify procedures that can help. From reception on, all staff members are really friendly and extremely efficient. You can tell that they pay very special attention to who they hire and that customer service and competence are top priorities for Dr. Levi. Having permanent and painful nerve damage due to pervasive arthritis, multiple joint surgeries, etc., they've actually given me my life back so I can function on a daily basis.|Highly personal and highly knowledgable service from the office staff to Dr. Levi himself. Although my treatment plan ended up with a surgical consult, after seeing Dr. Levi successfully for several years I felt 100% confident in his plan. His office helped to expedite the plan due to my pain. In addition the injections he gave me supplied significant pain relief which will help me to get through the next hurdles. I cannot recommend Dr. Levi and his team enough. The care is personal and of the highest quality!|Three months ago I had my initial visit with Dr. Levi who came highly recommended. I was happy with the appointment and liked Dr Levi. He sent me for further testing and after waiting a week for the testing facility to contact me to schedule the appointment I called them and they had not received the prescription for the testing. I called Dr. Levi's office, left multiple messages and after about a week, I finally heard back. The women I spoke to was very polite and very honest saying that it was buried on her desk, and she would sending it in. This was just before labor day so she told me to give it about (another) week. I appreciated her honesty and eventually was finally able to get the appointment scheduled - unfortunately they were very booked and scheduling 6 weeks out. When I finally had the testing done, I had to schedule an appointment  at Dr Levi's office to get the results (they do not give over the phone) since I was eager for the results and I wanted them sooner rather than later, I scheduled an appointment with the PA (Dr. Levi was scheduling weeks out). At my visit I thought I really liked the PA. She seemed to know her stuff and recommended a procedure that she said her and Dr. Levi consulted on. While explaining this procedure to me, I reminded her of an allergy I have (which was in my chart). She wasn't sure if I would still be able to have the recommended  procedure so she stepped out of the exam room to consult with Dr. Levi. When she came back into the exam room she explained that she could not speak to the Dr. because he was in a procedure. Rather than having me wait she said she would call me first thing the following morning to let me know if I should schedule the procedure or not. I did not hear from her the following day. Two days later I began leaving detailed messages almost daily and heard back from office staff 2 or 3 times. Each time the office staff would call and act as if I did not leave all the details as to my reason for calling on the voice message so each time they would take a message they were going to pass on. For some reason I was not able to get a call back from the PA or Dr. Levi. Finally, after a full week and a half they had me schedule a ""tele-health"" call (just a phone call - not even a zoom) in order to get Dr. Levi on the phone. I wanted to share my experience with him as it is his business (as a former business owner I thought it was the right thing to do - let him know about the administrative issues). The appointment was schedule on a Friday for the following Tuesday at 5:45 making (which made it 2 full weeks before I was going to be able to get any answers.  The appointment was for 5:45. At 7:00PM, as I was writing this, he finally called me. I explained all the above tp which he said ""I'm sorry"" (which came across as insincere) and said he didn't want to talk about that but my procedure which I was finally told I am unable to have due to this allergy. I have been living in pain for months - this unnecessarily added weeks to it when all someone had to do was call back and say ""I'm sorry no procedure"" so that I could have moved on to the next thing. Needless to say based on the administrative issues in this office and the fact that it is next to impossible to get an actual person on the phone I would NOT recommend Pain Partners LLC. Needless to say I am looking elsewhere for the next step.|I am so Happy to have Dr .levi and his staff back at the Danbury ,office.
Dr Levi  in my opinion , is one if not the top ! Pain specialist Dr 's I have ever had the privilege ,to met and to have as my Pain specialist. His knowlege and his expertise , is second to none.

From the medical assistants, APRN, and Dr Grahling. Very professional. Listened to my issues from other physicians who just threw me from doctor to doctor and didn't want to treat me. My second opinion which was a Rheumatologist referred me to pain management due to no concern for my health issues. I knew pain management was not the place I should be going due to the type of pain I have. Was referred to a Rheumatologist that will take the time to take care of my issues and not be dumped from doctor to doctor and was also referred to a Lyme specialist who will look further into my Lyme disease and why I'm having these terrible symptoms. Thank you Dr Grahling and staff. Very compassionate to my needs.|Was in a car accident and now have neck pain.  Been seeing chiropractor.  Went in due to still having pain even with chiropractic, stating I do not want pain meds or surgery.  Without laying a hand on me himself, and with no imaging at his fingertips to look at he told me I needed surgery.  He ordered X-rays.  Two days later told me to""continue with chiropractor and call if pain got worse"". I said ""that's why I called you in the first place! "". They then told me there was nothing they could do for me!    What a joke and a waste of a $40 co-pay!  Don't waste your time! Zero stars if I could!|Went to Dr. Eric Grahling office recently for an injection.  Last time was 2015.  This time went again and 1 day after injection,  I am sore where injection was done but normal.  But overall I feel 80% better than before. I have been dealing with chronic back pain for over 12 years.  Recently had surgery and did not help. But because of his extraordinary staff and his expertise,  he was able to lessen my pain so much. They are the best and recommends only going to them|I've been a patient of the practice for more than 5 years and every person in the office is professional & truly compassionate.  Dr. Grahling & his associates are extremely knowledgeable in identifying & treating pain.  Their explanation of procedures leaves nothing to question. I highly recommend the entire practice and can't thank, all of them, enough.  But most of all, the gratitude I have for Dr. Grahling and his knowledge of pain relieving procedures is so great.  Without him I would still have debilitating neck and low back pain.  He has given me a much better life!!! Thank you!|Dr. Eric Grahling is a wonderful doctor. He and his team have been very successful in managing my back pain without narcotics. His team is very friendly and helpful, and I feel very well cared for in their hands. I have had injections for back pain that have provided tremendous relief for me. He also is knowledgeable about the insurance process and getting diagnostic tests and procedures approved in a very timely manner!|My husband has been going to Dr. Grahling for about 1 year now.

He doesn't do any unnecessary procedures.  All former PM docs gave me cortisone shots no matter how many I had from previous docs.  Either thinking they would be better than other docs or just wanted easy money knowing they wouldn't work.  Not Dr. De Lara.  No more shots in my lumbar region for no reason.  PHEW!!

During all my years in pain, not one doctor addressed my neck issues but Dr. De Lara did.  He gave me what was, hands down , the best cortisone injection I have had.  Gave me a lot of numbing agent so I felt no burning or needle jabs in my disc.  He told me what to expect each and every step of the way and he was spot on in his description.  I feel awful for not remembering his assistant's name but she was awesome!!

Kelly Wilber, Dr. De Lara's PA, is AMAZING!!  She went over my cervical MRI report line by line explaining what was going on in layman's terms.  I have never had any doctor or surgeon do that for me.  During my last visit, she even looked at my knee that is swollen for some reason.  I only mentioned it due to being as active as I could be and she wanted to take a look at it.

The front office is FANTASTIC!!  They are always very nice to me even after dealing with very nasty patients.  I have seen them deal with a lot and they are always kind while they are getting yelled at.  Those women deserve some kind of medal for dealing with that day in and day out.

I have passed other employees in the halls and they have all had a smile on their face and say hi to me.

If you are looking for a PM doc and staff that will do right by you, look no further than Dr. De Lara and his team.|2023 Review: Dr. DeLara and his PA Kelly are just wonderful. They are both compassionate; never racing through our appointments or making me feel hurried or pressured. I always feel heard, supported, and understood. I truly appreciate the individualized care; especially from my recent visit with Kelly when she helped me navigate some complicated options. After a few minutes with her, I left the office more informed and ready to make my decision with confidence. I'm grateful to have their medical care and support.

2022 Review: Dr DeLara is the best pain specialist I have ever seen. I have autoimmune issues that have deteriorated my joints over the past 20 years to the point of no return. With multiple surgeries behind me, and more to come, it has been a horrible and defeating journey to say the least.

I make this review with the following in mind:
Knowledge - 5
Solution Mindset - 5
Office staff - 5
Variety of treatment options - 5
Bedside Manner - 5
Authentic connection to patients - 5|Dr Delara is fantastic! Due to several joint issues I've had to find a pain management practice. Dr. Delara is friendly, patient and listens well. Best of all he is an expert at injections! I've had to have several joint and spine injections in my life and my experience with this Dr is second to none. He is efficient and accurate all while distracting me so I'm not as nervous and focused on the procedure.|I love Dr. deLara's kind, thoughtful bedside manner- He is a true professional, and he wonderful at what he does. He has spent significant time with me, making sure I knew what was happening with my care plan, making sure I was comfortable with everything, and just truly showing how much he cares about his patients. This is extraordinarily welcomed, in a world where kindness is hard to come by, so it means more to me than I can put into words. Especially being in pain for so long, he took time out of his busy schedule to see me earlier, and his staff helped make that happen. I can't say enough good things about this office. Thank you!|This was my first visit with Dr DeLara, and it was GREAT! He was friendly, professional, attentive. He took great care to listen to my concerns, and addressed this in great detail. I felt quite at ease, and assured that I had made a good decision in picking Dr DeLara.
I have suffered with chronic pain for many years, and finally I feel a sense of hope!
The staff were pleasant, the office nice and clean. And the wait time was next to nothing!
I can not say enough good things about Dr DeLara, and my experience with him. I look forward to a long and successful relationship with him and his practice!|Dr Delara is hands down an amazing doctor he does everything he can to make you comfortable and listens to your every concern!!!! I have had injections in my lower back and RFA done both went so smooth and pain free!!! I wouldn't recommend anyone else! You will definitely leave happy!|My teen-age son and I have both been seeing Dr. Kristopher De Lara for nearly two years, and we both have been tremendously pleased with the care both the Dr. and the rest of staff have provided us with.

Between the two of us, we have had injections the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines, with zero negative side effects. I highly recommend Dr. De Lara and his team as an excellent pain management clinic for anyone suffering from spinal pain.|My first visit with Dr. Delaura gave me hope after 4 1/2 years of agony. He suggested injections in the piriformis muscle to alleviate pain in lower extremities. He said if that didn't work then seek out a different neurosurgeon for another opinion on lumbar and if they still wouldn't do surgery then the next step was a spinal cord stimulator. He won't stop until he finds the problem, unlike other Drs.,17 total.

No bedside manner, introduced himself after the consultation and treated me and my elderly mother like we were idiots. I have a medical background and I'd be ashamed if I treated my patients like he does. His PA seems empathetic but it's embarrassing that she world work for such a completely transparent misogynist. What a joke. Please, please stay away. You're nothing but cash to him; he has no humility, no empathy and doesn't listen or cares little for the  experiences of the women he's ""trying"" to treat.

His treatments have provided such relief that have enabled me to live my life almost pain free (moving my neck and feeling my hands) without heavy drugs. He is thorough in his explanations.. yes, quick, but will make sure I understand. Polite and professional. Dr Anand doesn't make empty promises about the success of treatment but what it might or might not do for you. Surgery isn't always the answer but there are many, many options. The treatments I have had have enabled me to have a life of almost no pain and I have Dr Anand's expertise to thank for that!

1.) HE LISTENS.
2.) HE PROVIDES PAIN RELIEF

Even during the pandemic the entire team bent over backwards to figure out how to keep everyone safe while attending to the patients individual needs. Dr. Ligham and all of the Physicians Assistances to the staff when you walk in to greet you are just amazing! These doctors are just shy  of a Miracle in my eyes. Pain is difficult on any level but when you have tools, procedures and medicine that actual help along with caring and dedicated doctors... that's a win win! Dr. Ligham is compassionate, caring, respected as well as highly intelligent that is experienced in the field of pain management. I trust him above and beyond any doctor!|Dr. Lingham was kind, considerate and is always working with the patient. I went with my spouse and it was my second appointment in 4 months. He listened and we talked about the specifics of how to move forward.  He didn't look at a computer once. It was more like a meeting to share information.  He is soft spoken, kind and sensitive. I am currently trying some different methods to deal with pain but I wanted to share where I am at. I may be back to him if I don't make progress. He ended by saying please come back if there is anything I can do. Just a nice guy,

Scot|I simply do not understand the negative reviews for Dr. Ligham and the staff at his clinic. The first day I went in he spent over an hour listening to me and really caring to make suggestions and take into account what I wanted. He met me with for an urgent consult to make sure that his office notes supported what my insurance needed to approve a therapy just because he believed it would help me. He has offered to manage my meds or allow my current doctor to do so and even recommended medical marijuana to improve my quality of life. He also has responded to my emails with questions very promptly. Additionally, Brittany his prior-authorization helper has gone out of her way to help me achieve a chance at the procedure I will try on Saturday. Really, be honest and open and he will listen and help you.|As a young person with chronic pain from a confluence of different causes, I've had a lot of bad experiences with doctors dismissing my pain or shunting me off to different specialists. My past experience made me incredibly nervous to see a pain specialist, but as soon as I met with Dr. Ligham for the first time I relaxed. He didn't judge me for having pain, didn't get frustrated with me when he couldn't easily parse out which of my conditions was the cause. Instead he carefully examined me, asked thoughtful questions, and took my pain seriously. Over the last two years in his care I have been treated so well by him and his staff. He has tried out multiple treatments, taken my desire for conservative management into consideration, but also pushed me to take my pain seriously when he felt I needed to do so. He is a thoughtful and intelligent doctor who I am lucky to have.|Prior to seeing Dr. Ligham, I had been on crutches for four years, and then on crutches or in a wheelchair for four months before some spinal shift happened that, overnight, left me unable to stand or walk.  I had been able to walk about a block on crutches, hold myself in standing with crutches, and walk up a couple steps, but because my mobility was already impaired, there wasn't much concern from my physicians when I lost what little I could do.

Dr. Ligham was the first doctor, among many excellent and compassionate practioners, to accurately recognize what was happening in my body.  He facilitated two urgent referrals, and helped me through the emotional process of preparing for a difficult surgery. 14 hours after surgery, I took my first steps on strong, steady legs, with feet that were relaxed and flat against the floor.  Eight days after surgery I transitioned from a walker to crutches and was able to walk up and down stairs.  It's looking like I'm going to be able to walk without assistance in a couple months.  I can't adequately describe the experience of having been moving through the world in so much pain, on unbalanced jelly legs, unable to hold myself upright, and going from that directly to being able to stand and walk with ease.

I will never be able to thank Dr. Ligham enough for his perception and care.  He will always be a hero to my friends and family and me.|Dr Ligham doesn't listen, he manages pills not pain. He makes his patients have an office visit every month with his PA who is not allowed to change meds even when they were giving me adverse reactions.  My choice was to keep taking them or be in pain. His PA wouldn't even call Dr ligham to tell him what was happening. So I realized the once a month visit was just so he could get paid for an office visit. Ligham is an apathetic man and really shouldn't be in pain management   He should just stick with being an anesthesiologist because he seems to have very little knowlege of patient care.|unfortunately due to being disabled,, I've been a patient at this office for over 15 yes. I started with Dr Levin and when he left for Baltimore I switched to Dr Robbins. I can't say enough good things about Dr Robbins and the staff at the office. Everyone Ive dealt with (too many for me to name everyone )has always been friendly and  helpful..  Dr Robbins is very thorough, always professional with a great bedside manner., ,he's always  trying new methods  lto help me get painfree.. He uses cutting edge treatments instead of meds to help me obtain better quality of life. I can't say enough good things about Doc Roc, I  highly recommend him !|This man was awful! I was there for almost 90 mins for an initial consultation. I tried to speak & he told me to stop, he'd read my records and ask questions if he had any. He trashed the head of Neurosurgery at Yale and told me he never should have done the 12 hr surgery on my thoracic & lumbar back! It left me with a 14in incision scar, 9 vertebra with pedicule screws & rods anchored into my pelvis. 18mths of PT, still ongoing. I can't step on my right foot without excruciating pain. I've lost 3/4 of an inch on my right hip & leg requiring a shoe lift. Can't stand or walk unaided. Can't stand for longer than 3 mins due to excruciating spine, leg, & foot pain, before needing to sit. Told me not to do the cervical correction still needing to be done. He'd give me the name of another surgeon that would agree with him. Told me that my chronic pain mgmt Dr of 6 yrs was incorrect for continuing my opioid pain meds, he couldn't justify it. After berating me for my lack of character for even thinking my pain might have risen to the level of someone really needing pain meds, he starts suggesting possible remedies. A 30 day inpatient drug treatment facility or a methadone regime. Then he hands me a literature package for an implanted glorified tens unit. So let me get this straight? He doesn't think further spinal correction surgery is a good idea but an $80k surgery to implant another medical device that has limited ongoing success, is? I wonder what the bonus he receives from the medical device manufacturer is? This man has a God-complex. How dare you ask him any questions. He is one of a handful of drs in the state of Connecticut still prescribing opioid medications and that power has gone to his head! The pendulum has swung so far to the other side, chronic pain patients such as myself that have a real need for opioid pain meds, are belittled and made to feel like drug addicts. And currently there is no place we can go for help! So what happens now? One thing is for sure, don't look to Dr. Ligham for support, compassion, or help. He's deaf on that subject!",2022-10-13|2023-02-15|2020-01-16|2019-07-25|2019-07-25|2018-09-12|2021-02-02|2019-05-13,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJATyypDjY54kRl5zg18NgqbM,16

I was searching on my computer and found The CT Centers fo Neuropathy and Chronic Pain.  I made the appointment and met with Michelle, the APRN.  That was the best decision I have ever made.  The Nurses who set up my treatment for the 30 treatments I went through, Pam, Caroline and Jen, were awesome.

I tried the Synexus therapy And didn't notice anything at first but after doing it for I believe a couple of weeks I started to see major improvements and currently I am about 90% pain-free. The staff was excellent very attentive and it was a very pleasurable experience I highly recommend it to anyone|Answering service for this office is a joke and they never relay the messages. The office itself is even worse. Everyone dabbles in the scheduling process creating a big mess.
When I complained about getting threatened that treatment would be terminated if I no showed again. ** remember I NEVER no showed** it was answering service's issue** the nurse APRN that runs the place sat with me and told me no problem and went into the computer and supposedly ""fixed it"".
So here we are on Friday 12/10/21 I have a family emergency and I can't go to my appointment I call and of course no one picks up and my call is sent to the answering service, knowing that I'm wasting my time I continue to leave a message. No call backs no nothing!!!  Come Monday 12/13/21 I show up for my appointment and the door is locked and only back room light is on. I waited 5 min and nothing. At this point I'm ticked off with all the unprofessional antics that have taken place but I decided to try one more time and I show up for my next appointment on 12/15/21 and the LPN  on duty stops me and says ""no no no your done you blew off your last appointment"". I ask her according to who? The nerve of her to blurt out ""everyone"" and continues on to tell me that I was well informed that treatment was terminated. lol of course I show up knowing I am no longer a patient.... What a joke !
Never mind that she isn't the friendliest person or that she talks about inappropriate topics with patients for everyone to here.
Needless to say I'm angry that I was treated so unfairly, that my treatment was terminated without explaining what my next steps are going  to be.

Dr Cherry is his partner that compliment's the practice. They are a busy office. I do recommend the practice if you experience pain.|Dr Kost is the best. I was going to a different doctor for pain injections and I always had to wait over an hour past my appointment time to see him and then he spent about 4 minutes with me, didn't answer questions and sped along to the next patient. Dr Kost is the opposite - he is on time with appointments and takes the time to talk to you about your pain and consider different ways to deal with it. You can tell that he really cares and the treatments are very effective.|All staff and docters are great!

Unfortunately the first shot for sciatica only lasted 2 weeks, and the 2nd a month later only lasted 3 weeks.|Dr. Kost was able to diagnose my husbands problem after several visits to other doctors. He took the time to listen and explore causes of his pain. His staff followed through on phone calls and answered problems that he had in a timely fashion. I don't see that much now a days in other offices. We would highly recommend Dr. Kost  to anyone who needs answers for their pain.|Dr. Kost has been wonderful to me over the years at Bristol Hospital and then Blue Back square.
He has the best ""bedside manner"" and ALWAYS shows compassion for his patients. After all we want to be validated when we are in pain not condescended to. He is so good that it became impossible to get an appointment with Dr Kost. His assistants are ok, but they are not HIM and he is who you want.
I needed radio frequency following a 4 level cervical fusion. I had chronic headaches on the left side (surgery side) My date got changed and I was dying, so, he ended up referring me to Dr Grahling,, at  CT.Comprehensive Pain Management, in Plainville, CT. He also is very good, but he is not as personable as Dr Kost is. Very stoic and not responsive when things go wrong. after the 2nd RF caused me to get ""spaghetti legs"",for many weeks and I ended up in the ER, he was angry at me. Not sure why, because the first RF worked great.

There is one nurse in Dr Kosts office who is the most rude thing out there.
Everyone says it not just me.
She is a snippy, rude, witch who has zero compassion for someone that works in a PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC.
Dr. Kost needs to get rid of her vibe, because it is not at all helpful, needed or wanted, I wish I could remember her name.
She has no business working around people.
Little wretch.

I read the other review about someone having a bad result from an ESI, and then kicked out for having marijuana in their urine test.
Dr. Kost sits on the DCP Medical Marijuana Board.
As long as a person has been issued a medical mj card, legally, there is no foundation,
to ""kick"" anyone out of any pain mgmt clinic. .
That is pretty hypocritical at best & Dr Kost should walk the walk.
Does Dr Kost recommend medical mj & prescribe narcotics, like he advocates?
I have it in writing from a 2015 DCP board meeting.

Those shots over time, just wear off. I got them for over 10 years and I am done.
I even tried the pain pump trial. Not a fan of those wires pulling out just for tying my shoe.
I am anti-injection now.
That is why I TRIED the medical mj program.
Nobody wants to prescribe actual pain medication any more.
Plus, who can afford those pricey urine screenings, every (3) months""?
My insurance will not pay for them that often claiming; ""not medically necessary"".
People in chronic pain, are looked down on, judged and dismissed.

January 2016 I ended up listening to Dr Kosts advice, (waiting for artificial discs) made an appointment to see Dr Aferzon, who ordered  a new MRI of my lumbar spine. In 10 days, WC approved a 360 degree lumbar fusion with 2 artificial discs to be implanted, where L-4&5 collapsed.

After an ablation at L4 given by Dr. Patel, I became disabled adult consume severe to excruciating pain for seven months I gave up hope and we went to Dr. Gutierrez to learn how to deal with the life that was going to be a continual suffering God bless Dr Gutierrez, he is cheerful, kind, and friendly manner was very refreshing as was his diagnostic instinct. I will never forget the first word she said to me after my examination. And I quote "" Mr. Dworkin something doesn't feel right would you please let me just do an x-ray of your pelvic region"" I agreed and five minutes later he came back smiling. He told me I was missed diagnosed, and that my primary problem was that I needed a total hip replacement, because there was no Cartlidge between my hip bone and my hip socket . He gave me some names of good surgeons he would recommend we took those and did our research and came up with a different doctor Dr. Mark Schachmann, who did an excellent job

But the most amazing thing. to figure out I had not been treated correctly, but rather was treated with by people without hearts and minds. He restored my faith in the medical profession.

His kindness and cheerfulness gave me hope. His diagnosis save me from a life of chronic pain. I would highly recommend this man with no reservations whatsoever. He gets top evaluation in every aspect.|My experience with Dr Gutierrez was very helpful. I'm sure I'll be seeing him again.
He's a very knowledgeable MD.|Unacceptable to put someone in a room and not check on them for two hours! I was in severe pain, and it seem like nobody cared.

His staff is friendly, but most importantly, Dr Kloth is the best, most knowledgeable, comforting doctor there is. When I was told there was nothing that could be done for my dislocated and very painful collarbone by several doctors, I was thankfully, referred to Dr Kloth. In 2 visits, I was pain free after a year of suffering. He is amazing and won't stop until he finds what will work for you. I'm so glad I found him. He is the very best there is!  Thank you, Dr Kloth.|David Kloth. He has been fantastic. Listening and taking care of my issue. I had back surgery and still on excessive pain finding out it's my sacroiliac joint.

I seem to be better. but from walking like an old man for a year, my back is curved badly trying to walk straight is very hard. But he's doing a great job helping I really appreciate him. David. Thank you, Gary Crisci.|At the time of writing this review I have been an established patient of Dr. David Kloth for 20 months. To write a review, an established patient's experience will be much more meaningful and compelling to one who may be seeking treatment.

After 6 years of complex medical conditions, no overall diagnosis and chronic pain as a result, I had the occasion to be referred to Dr. David Kloth for pain management. Dr. Kloth has excellent medical instincts, training, experience, and a high level of conscientiousness. From our first appointment to the present day, Dr. Kloth has been able to create a treatment plan which has included various modalities of pain management: long-acting steroid injections, medications, physical therapy, ablations, and trigger point injections. There is a logical process of addressing specific areas of pain as well as an overall strategy to reduce pain overall. The successful treatment of my pain with Dr. Kloth has been accomplished with collaborative discussion, reviewing medical records and imaging, answering questions, managing expectations, and educating me as the patient. Treatment is recommended, and based on the trust created in our relationship, I have the relief and assurance that I am achieving the best possible outcomes for pain management. This is evidenced in asking the correct questions, undergoing procedures which have resulted in a higher level of functioning and quality of life. It is a fluid process of addressing pain as medical conditions and functioning changes over time. The permutations of pain management with knowledge, techniques and recommendations are nearly inexhaustible. Dr. Kloth is a nationally renowned pain management specialist with the training and experience unequaled by any other physician in the area. His waiting room reflects his ability to collaborate with people of any age, gender, race, social background or presenting medical conditions in which a patient has found themselves in need of pain management services. His office staff abundantly supports his efforts in a busy medical environment. In the time I have been a patient, the office staff, assistants, and receptionists have been responsive in a timely manner. His treatment rooms, office spaces and waiting areas are immaculate and well organized.

Finally, inescapably, a patient who is seeking medical expertise that I have described in detail and experienced personally will find it in Dr. David Kloth's Ortho Pain Care practice. His office, including assistants, office people, receptionists and everyone who helps to keep that ""wheel turning"" are more than helpful, dedicated and compassionate to your needs as a patient. Everyone is to be commended for creating and maintaining a private medical practice of this caliber.

I am grateful for the few physicians who have helped me at an exceedingly challenging time of my life. After 7.5 years, I have just been finally diagnosed by a physician in a different specialty. Dr. Kloth is and remains one of those physicians who has made all the difference in management of this rare condition.

Susan Foster Hayo|I am thoroughly in disagreement with the negative comments.  I find Dr Kloth to be professional, knowledgeable and kind.  He has a very funny sense of humor.  And is concerned about my issues.  The staff is also professional, answered any questions I had.  I recommend him highly|I CAN NOT BELIVE HE is STILL IN PRACTICE!! I'm writing this years later after seeing many very similar situations... I went to see him with my young son and daughter still in a car seat... long story short I asked for him to show me on the skeleton model where I would be injected .. when I tell you this man became violent ... with my young children present...I was escorted out by the poor girl at the desk and I called the police ....it was that terrifying ... They took a report .. I filed complaint with the state and he got a slap on the wrist... I got booted from the practice... one that I had been with for several years... this was my first time ever seeing him tho...
Something needs to be done about him...|After sending in documents so the doctor could review them to understand my situation I get this response from his secretary,"" Dr.Kloth said he would see you for a consult for you chronic back pain and could take over management of your Hydrocodone and Methocarbamol but not the Ramelteon or Suvorexant.
Please let me know if you would like to move forward with scheduling a consult.
Now how is it when I ask about following up with what I thought was part of the treatment plan am I the one who is seeking drugs? No Doctor Kloth what I'm seeking is RELIEF and thought I wouldn't have to hear an excuse about losing your license to not continue the treatment that has been working.|Dr Kloth is certainly HONEST about what he thinks is going on and what will, or will not fix it.

Peg M, retired hospital RN|Interesting experience trying to make an appointment for a consultation with Dr. Patel. If I could give no stars I would. I never spoke with the doctor. I spoke with a member of her staff who told me I might not be a candidate for her services. Since he isn't a doctor, I'm not sure why he would tell me this. He advised me the cost of treatment would be out of pocket - which I knew. I asked the price of each PRP injection and he told me $2500. I've been given a cost for the same treatment of $800 per injection, so I asked what made Dr. Patel's treatment worth so much more. He told me the treatment was high quality, and if I was shopping around for other prices and cost was important to me, I should probably go elsewhere since he doubted they could help me. He made me feel cheap, unreasonable and disrespected. Very bad experience.  I've never before been told to go away because I was getting more than one quote for an out of pocket procedure. Awful experience that added a level of emotional distress to my already difficult level of pain.|Dr Patel has been my pain management doctor for over 15 years. She is a brilliant and compassionate physician. I highly recommended her.|I have been a patient of Dr. Patel's for over seven years and I trust her completely with my health and well-being. She is not only a competent, intelligent and knowledgeable physician but she is a compassionate human being with a wonderful sense of humor. She has amazing diagnostic skills and is persistent in finding the right treatment and care. As someone who battles chronic pain and autoimmune diseases, I honestly don't know where I would be without Dr. Patel.

Dr Paz and staff throughly explain everything and discomfort was very minimal. I would definitely recommend this practice !|Oh, Dr. Paz, you wizard of spines,
You've given my mom back her sunny shines.
She was in such pain, it's hard to explain,
Even Oxy couldn't dull that insane strain.

Two ibuprofen, two acetaminophen,
She tried it all, but the pain wouldn't soften.
She said, ""I can't live like this anymore!""
Then you walked in, her knight to restore.

With hands so steady, and skills so divine,
You fixed her spine--not once, but twice, so fine.
You made it look easy, like a walk in the park,
While we sat there amazed, mouths agape in the dark.

No recovery time? No lingering ache?
Doc, you're a legend, for heaven's sake!
You didn't just heal her, you gave her a restart,
You've got the magic touch, the healer's art.

Now Mom's back to life, no pain in her stride,
Thanks to you, she's got years by her side.
She's laughing, she's walking, she's living anew,
All because of the miracles you somehow do.

So here's to you, Dr. Paz, our hero in scrubs,
You've filled our hearts with gratitude and love.
You've given us more than words can convey,
Thank you for giving Mom her life back today!

Forever grateful, we sing your praise,
Dr. Paz, you've brightened our days.
A surgeon, a savior, a master, a star,
You're the reason Mom's pain is now afar!|Dr. Paz came highly recommended to me by a friend and patient of his.  So far, my experience is very positive.  I met Amanda initially before my procedure and was impressed by her professionalism.  Dr. Paz was very quick with the procedure.

From that point it only got better as the check in staff and the Aprn team were extremely professional.  I felt secure and knew that I was in the right place.

I received my treatment and I am secure in my decision on having Dr Paz plan and execute my treatment.   I highly recommend Dr Paz and his team.|He is a wonderful man with a very professional and caring staff I had a compressed L2 fracture. He just did this procedure cemented it back into place. I am so grateful for all they did for me.Thank you|I came back after a few years, needing an injection for an L5 nerve compression.  Dr Paz has such a soothing effect on me and this time I didn't have my normal ""pass out"" feeling I have gotten in the past.  A little Valium helped too. I recently lost my 26 year old son and I am very emotionally fragile so I wasn't sure how my nerves would stand up.  They may do these injections all the time.  But for me my back injuries are tied to physically caring for and keeping my son alive for 26 years.  Now I am trying to care for me.   And I appreciate the kind and funny personalities at this practice.  I am extremely grateful and I hope this sciatic pain will give me a break for awhile.  Thank you again!!

My neurologist recommended the group. He wanted me to see Dr Robbins unfortunately at the beginning He wasn't taking new patients and I had to see a different doctor who I didn't particularly care for But he did leave the practice. Although I loved seeing the PA's. When the doctor left the practice I was able to get in with Dr Robbins who is phenomenal! I love going to advance diagnostic pain treatment center. Dr Robbins is great. Along with the PA's Andy McDowell is my favorite I see him most of the time and then I see Dr Robbins maybe four times a year I try not to see him every month unless I have a major issue going on since I basically have issues that will not be cured. Is medical assistant Sue is The nicest person I've ever met. I have lots of doctors in Connecticut I've only been living here 7 yrs  believe me at lot of my other Dr's offices many of the employees are not pleasant. I wish everyone could be like Sue. I think some people just don't give advance diagnostics pain treatment center a shot. You have to follow the rules especially with everything going on nowadays with people abusing control substances. We might not be abusing them but people might be able to get into our stuff for steal them etc. So just do what you need to do and there won't be a problem. All prescriptions are sent electronically that's the law to have of prescriptions by any doctor even your family doctor to send an antibiotic everything must be sent electronically.|I've been a patient here at Advanced Diagnostic Pain Management    for about 7 or more years. I have constant chronic back, leg, and neck pain due to degenerative arthritis. I've had several surgeries.
Everyone on staff at this office is very welcoming and friendly.
Dr. Ligham is my physician and he is so helpful and understanding. The PA's and Doctors are very professional. I am very pleased with the care I receive!  Thank you all very much!

B.|Dr. Robbins is the 3rd pain management doctor I have seen prior to and after my spine surgeries. I had been in chronic debilating  pain for years until I found him. He is familiar with and practices  current technologies and treatments for pain, very calm, personable, explains everything thoroughly and an all around nice guy.  He literally gave me my life back. I can't praise him enough.|Dr. Ligham is top-notch and wonderfully kind with a great bedside manner. When they say on their website that they do things differently, they really do! He sat with me for over an hour and really got to know me, my pain, my goals, and we decided on a treatment plan that had both his and my input. I am so excited to work with him and improve my pain and quality of life. I can't say enough positive things about my visit and hopes for the next steps, which will start soon.|Ive been under Dr. Lighams care for 4 yrs now. He's the compassionate Doctor I've ever had he truly cares about his patients. Rare now a days. All of his staff is very helpful & also compassionate. Thanks Dr. Lighams Andy Patty & the rest of the Staff|I've Been fighting chronic pain since a terrible car accident that we survived, Total disc replacement, spinal fusion, as well as, a spinal cord stimulator are my surgeries. Crps as a result of one.... Life has been hell for the last 5 years. I've yet to meet a more compassionate medical team. Dr. Lingham, his PA'S, as well as, the medical assistants (Patty, Courtney and others) are incredibly professional and compassionate. Within just a couple of months they have already fast exceeded treatment options that my doctor for the last 4 years, didn't even seam to know about. I have hope with this practice and can't wait to see where I will be functionally in just a year.|Dr. Legum does not care about patient's injuries nor does his whole office . They never got to my injuries. and it took over three months before he got my medical records and took 10 minutes to  go over  my x-rays then send me home no medication  he never raise me high enough to relieve my pain he doesn't even deserve one star . I  was a patient for almost a year they charge me $5000 for two urinalysis  and then discharge me with no medication and I have been in severe pain for six months now can't find another pain management I just wish I never went there|Dr. Ligham is the worst dr I have ever been to. He is very rude and belittling I was discriminated by him. I can't even see a different dr at the practice because one they choose a dr for you you can't change dr. He is not clear about people who have been approved for medical canibus to have to stop or not. Finally Andy told me that it is one or the other. So I stoped and a month later I had a clean urine test. I risked having a sezuire and had night terrors because I was also on the medical canibus for ptsd. He told me he won't prescribe me medicine anyway! The office has no idea what to do. I showed up for my first appointment there and she said I needed a referral from my insurance.

discs that she could no longer sleep, sit or walk and had lost 31 pounds due to lack of appetite from extreme pain.

My Mother, in her 80's had advanced CLL (Leukemia) which made her a very difficult case because Dr Kloth had to approach her spine from an unusual angle being ultra careful not to hit any small capillaries or veins due to the CLL.. This made the procedure far more complicated and it's outcome/success far less sure. But what he did for her that day with one injection was nothing short of a miracle.

While Dr Kloth is a very serious man who can appear at first blush to be brusk, he is rather, a kind, caring, compassionate and brilliant Dr who is fully committed to his patients and their well being. He is the Dr. that Drs. send their wives, children and family members to and with good reason. There's simply no one like him - he's the best of the best.

I should note, my mother's surgeon insisted that she was not a candidate for Epidural injection. He tried to motivate her to opt for back surgery which at her age and with her comorbidities might have ended her life.
Via a recommendation from the president of a noted hospital we consulted Dr Kloth and with one injection he restored my mother's life back to normal. She had no more pain from that day on and lived to be 92.

Dr. Kloth is without equal - he's the best in his field.|",2021-04-18|2019-01-06,5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|thorough_care|pain_management_services|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|good_doctors|short_wait_times|medication_management|on_site_pharmacy|friendly_staff|convenient_clinic_location|multiple_locations,,,,,,,,,,ChIJTSjEEw2nwokR0TFH9CXDWEk,2

Excuse me how are you a pain management doctor and you don't know what else to do for a patient I believe his license should be taken what type of medical practice said those words to a patient.  DISGUSTING FOR A PHYSICIAN TO TREAT A PATIENT IN THAT MANNER YOUR A DOCTOR TO HELP PEOPLE NOT JUDGE THEM OR SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THERE'S A SUCH THING CALLED MEDICATION THAT'S WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE.  So sick of doctors that are full of themselves and don't help the ones that need the help.   But give 300 plus pills a month to drug addicts that sell their medication on the street to then go stock a needle in their arm. SOMEONE FROM THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.|My pain management doctor was retiring and referred me to Dr. Sood. I was super nervous having to switch after 15+ years with the same provider, but Dr. Sood and his staff made the transition super easy. Dr. Sood is very knowledgeable, caring and very compassionate. Everyone I've dealt with in the practice is so helpful and kind. Thank you!|I met Dr. Sood for the first time today. He was extremely thorough and spent a great deal of time with me going over my various conditions. I found Dr. Sood to be very conservative in his prescribing practices. I return in 2 weeks for injections. I look forward to a positive professional relationship with Dr. Sood!|Dr. Sood seemed very nice. He told me he was going to start doing Flowonix Pumps in the next few weeks and would call me the second he was ready. That was 4 years ago. Never heard from him again.  So basically he's a liar and didn't have the class to call and tell me he lied about taking me on as a patient. Dr. Shalmi from his Westchester office is even worse. Called and canceled my appointment the day before it after waiting a month. Lied and said he didn't do pain pumps when he does my friends who has the same brand as me. Another doctor to scared to take an actual sick patient because they're to sick.|A terrible doctor they should rip his license!!!! My husband who has chronic pain for 15 plus years and on same medication for years unfortunately made the terrible decision to have this doctor for pain management after moving here in CT!!!! How could you do a spinal injection treatment without explaining to the patient the possible risk and complication???? Do you even review your patient medical history including treatment that they have in the past that were unsuccessful???? Shame on you! And if the patient refused your injection treatment then you labelled them as drug seeking!!!! Shame on you ! Youre arrogant and has no compassion for your patients!!!  I wish we read the review here prior to contacting your office . To everyone please read the review here ... it's all real!!!! This doctor is out to make money ! No compassion at all!|I have been with Pain And Spine Specialists Of CT  for quite some time and Dr. Sood is so amazing. He is very patient and kind with his Patients and he takes the time to explain everything to you in layman terms. But, I cannot leave out his PA'S and also his whole office staff. Everyone there is awesome and I'm very appreciative of them always trying to help me.|Dr. Sood is extremely thorough, and will take his time with his examination. I started to see Dr. Sood two years ago because the pain management doctor who was trying to treat me was not able to. He referred me to Dr. Sood. My prior doctor wanted to implant a device in my spine that would help with pain control, but without certain tests to see if it would be safe. When I told Dr. Sood this, he agreed to it also but first I had to have a MRI to make sure It would be safe; and as it turned out, it wouldn't have. Dr. Sood saved me from a device that would have hurt me. Treating my syndrome was challenging to say the least, but Dr. Sood was kind and compassionate during that awful period in my life. I ended up having a few C spine epidurals that worked. He saw me through. Dr. Sood is soft spoken and direct. Don't misunderstand this as not caring. When you ask questions, he will answer them thoroughly. As patients we have certain responsibilities with helping to manage our situations.

She has an amazing way of conveying medical terminology and information into layman's terms. No matter the reason, whether diagnostic or invasive (as I have now seen her on multiple occasions for both), I would fully recommend Dr. Huang-Lionnet.|I've been seeing Dr. Huang-Lionnet and her staff for quite some time for a torn rotator cuff from playing sports. I was able to get PRP treatment on it and so far it is amazing. Definitely beats having to get surgery!  Dr. Huang-Lionnet and her staff treat me extremely well when I'm at their office. I'm so thankful I was referred to her from a fellow colleague.  She has outstanding credentials, is extremely knowledgeable, and really listens to what I explain to her.

When it didn't add up, he refused to order an MRI and he treated me like a criminal. He told me constantly the pain was all in head, and all I needed was a psychiatrist. I had no where to go so I put up with him. Finally with pain unbearable there was a big blow out. When the MRI came back he said ""You need surgery asap for the disc pressing on your spinal cord!

Rude, insulting not to mention poor ethics and terrible judgement.|Rather than do tests to see what was causing my pain, Dr. Paggioli gave me an epidural shot that did not work and which resulted in pain at the injection site that continued until I ended up in Urgent Care two weeks later because I could not walk. He refused to speak to me about this. Dr. Foster from the Windham Hospital Pain Management Department later discovered that the pain I saw Dr. Paggioli for was the result of an unfused vertebra in my spine.

It's good to have a doctor who knows what I'm going through and I can talk to. I can't keep getting surgery but my doctor listens and tries to help as much as possible and is now wanting me to use swimming to help me, and I agree. He's a good doctor and tries various treatments to give relief not just pills although I would be in terrible pain without them.. this is why my surgeon who is a brain surgeon recommended me to him so the shots, medicines patches and different low impact exercises to help.

I've had to call everyday to check up on the status of my referral from my primary MD, which was faxed last week. The nurse has yet to call me to discuss scheduling an appointment.

Up until this point I've been in awe of how kind and organized everyone has been.

First, I show up and no one but the front desk lady is particularly friendly. I was reduced to giving one word answers because my being nice was almost immediately shut down.

They made me fill out a big packet of paperwork at home and didn't even ask for it.

The doctor came in texting, barely acknowledged me when we started our appointment and at that point everything was civil. I was not expecting much.

A few minutes in he got a phone call and barely excused himself before putting it to his ear and rushing out. He came back a few moments later and I was expecting he had a medical/family emergency. No. His adult son was moving to college and was having issues. I don't even answer calls when I'm in my accounting meetings. This is a doctor.

The appointment got progressively worse the more questions I had and he clearly did not have time for me.

I was not rude, but when he got short with me I knew I wasn't getting anywhere and would rather have not wasted my time. I just ended up giving him the information he wanted to hear and that was that.

I should have left the moment I found out the phone call wasn't life or death.

I LOVE the puppy first of all. He's part of the family. I have been in and out of numerous clinics/offices for pain over the past 5yrs and these people are the ONLY ones who have TRIED to help me. They've put forth the effort to try to find solutions for my case. They never once threw their hands in the air like every other Dr/surgeon has. Aside from how wonderful they've been medically, the ladies in that office have become friends. They are so compassionate, supportive, quick to respond to issues, and have gone above and beyond for me personally. They genuinely do care about their patients which is a rarity in this specialty. By far the best office staff I've experienced. I used to get panic stricken prior to every appt with past providers because of the way I was treated even though I was always compliant. My anxiety was just terrible for days prior. For YEARS. This office erased that. I actually looked forward to my appts. The ""pill counter""  Is anything but just a pill counter. Her name is Angelica, and she GOES HARD for her patients. That girl advocates like no other. She does the work behind the scenes patients don't get to see too often unless they are back there with her. She's on the phone with pharmacists making sure patients have their medication in time and doesn't take their crap if they make things difficult for the patient which we pain patients know happens all too often. We are LUCKY to have her! I've never smelled anything animal in that office and I'm the type of person who is the one to smell something when nobody else does. That puppy is GREAT to have around for the patients and very well trained to not run under feet. Dr. Thimineur would never allow the puppy to be in the office if he thought it was a threat to his patients or a liability (neither would puppy's owner) trust me. He's our in office therapy dog. I've seen that puppy put so many smiles on patients faces especially the wheelchair bound and elderly. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions of course, but go be a patient at 10 other pain specialists offices THEN circle back and rank this one. I'm devastated to have lost my care here due to insurance reasons. I know I'll never find another office like these guys or care like this ever again.|Woodbridge office is a mess, there is a small dog that is free roaming and can trip someone who has and number of back issues. The smell of dog as well is unbearable. The young lady that counts medications is rude and has server attitude issues. Consider another doctor.|I've been a patient for several years now, and I find Dr Thimineur to be one of the best pain doctors I've ever seen.  He saved my life and cut my pain level by 60-75% implanting an occipital neurostimulator. I also receive epidurals for my upper and lower cervical and they work wonderfully thanks to Dr Thimineur!!I can't say enough about his staff! They are beyond terrific and you never have to wait to be seen unlike many other pain doctors where you wait for at least 3 hours.Your not going to find a more knowledgeable, kind and caring pain doctor around!|As a new patient, I had a very good first meeting with Dr. Thimineur and an equally good follow up with his medical associate, Andrew Paulson.   As a Complex Regional Pain sufferer, as well as someone who has a childhood spinal injury that requires epidural injections, I have responsibly used prescribed opioid drugs for my pain; though because I have been in remission and free of them for more than a year, I saw Dr. Thimineur only to schedule epidural injections for my back, not to ask for medication.As the date of the procedure approached, I called with questions about follow up care and was told by his coordinator, Gina, of whose medical credentials I'm uncertain, that I would not be allowed any further direct contact with Dr. Thimineur, or his medical associate, Andrew, and that all decisions about my follow up care, including any pain medication I might need as a result of the procedure, would be made by or through her.Having been off opioid medication for so long, I was concerned about post procedural pain and wanted answers from my doctor, and tried to schedule a meeting with him before the procedure.  I was told by Gina that doing so was impossible and I cancelled my epidurals and scheduled the first available appointment with Dr. Thimineur before rescheduling the epidural procedure.  Before that appointment could occur, I received a notice that I was terminated as a patient, for no specific reason.  I have since unsuccessfully tried to contact Dr. Thimineur for an explanation, and can  only assume that asking questions and insisting on answers from a qualified medical professional disqualified me as a worthy patient.While Dr. Thimineur and his medical associate, Andrew, were courteous, knowledgeable and seemed very competent, his assistant Gina basically  accused me of trolling for drugs because I expressed concern about postoperative pain management.  As a longterm pain patient, I fully understand the need to better control opioid abuse, but drug shaming responsible and legitimate patients isn't a solution.  Great doctors, absolutely terrible and arrogant support personnel.   Jean Calabrese|Dr.Thimineur's group informed me that my insurance company rejected a radio frequency procedure on my lower back, and that they wanted to perform a nother lumbar injection which I have had done twice in the past, once recently performed by Dr Thimineur, both times it didn't work, the pain came back within a week. What makes Dr Thimineur believe that the results would be any different this time around??I contacted the insurance company, and they have no record of a Radio Frequency Procedure been submitted by Dr.Thiminuer.????|I have been a patient for over 10 years. Dr. Thimineur is very knowledgeable with CRPS, scoliosis, and herniated disks. He is able to understand my pain. When I see him my appt isn't 5 mins. He takes time to explain my condition and doesn't sugar coat my future. Without him I would of never made it this far. His staff can be hit or miss but long term staff like Andrew is just as good as the doctor. Do not listen to all the negatives you may read. Take it from a decade long patient that he is truly the best!|I was a patient at. Comp. Pain and headache center since they opened. I went for over 20 years. I even went on Sundays when Dr. Thiminuer had a Dr. who would wire you up like a PINBALL MACHINE,  you had to sit there for over an hour, you had to look at a computer and make objects connect. How this made me feel better I will never keep. I went on Saturday and Sunday for 6 weeks. I was working then, leaving my family. Anyhow,  I left the practice April of 2018, because every time you go there, they would question you pain medications usage, and if you took more than they thought you should, Andrew would chew me out like he was the teacher and he caught me SMOKING IN BOYS BATHROOM. At that time I moved out of the area, Again, When I moved back to this area I called them 6 times and left my name and number with NEVER a call back. I don't know how a Dr. asst. can feel your pain, I guess they are MIND READERS.|I had a horrible experience at a pain management center and asked my doctor for another recommendation. Dr. Thimineur was like NIGHT AND DAY from the other provider. I let my doctor know that he should be recommending Dr. Thimineur over any other pain management center.Dr. Thimineur gave me a tremendous amount of time during my first visit and he really helped me understand the issues I have following a car accident almost 4 years ago. His staff were amazing and treated me so professionally.I highly recommend Dr. Thimineur and his team!",2025-02-25|2025-02-06|2019-08-20|2017-09-15|2020-01-15|2019-08-30|2019-07-29|2018-07-26,5|1|5|1|1|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Appointments recommended",,,multiple_locations|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|injection_treatments,,,,,,,,,,ChIJZ5DF5IHg54kRBmxZaxdAnxM,14

The front staff were very nice too me and accomodating.
The intake dr., no names being mentioned, he was harsh, rude, bad besd side manner and awful demeanor.
Too top he switch my med too a much stronger med that has been on back order in all naugatuck valley and area pharmacys.
When i called at 5 min to 5pm the service answered.
I was told in no uncertain terms that i am to not call unless its an emergency that they have a policybto not bother the on call dr for medication problems. Now its 926 am the next day and they still have the swrvice answering.
Im not getting a good taste in my mouth as of yet.|My husband and I have had the worst experience with the staff at the Derby, CT location. They are rude and nasty, have no empathy for the patients. We were also told that processing of referrals and appointments had to wait until they came back from vacation. It takes weeks for them to process referrals and requests. Also, they do not answer the phones and when you try to ask questions they do not want to be bothered. This needs to be addressed by hiring staff that are experienced and are pleasant.|The lack of empathy, clarity, and patience from the staff is astonishing at this practice. When I called because there was no follow-up from my apointment, the staff took no time to help me understand the one question I had. The staff member raised her voice aggressively, interrrupted me, insulted me, and hung up the phone. I have no words- just stunning. Steer clear- this is no way to spend a minute of your life, especially when you're already in pain (no should be an option, this is what I would rate this center).|My provider Karolina has been extremely thorough & empathetic during my pain struggles & care at CPHTC. I have also had positive interactions with both Robin & Dr. Thimineur. I do prefer the Meriden office. I feel as a smaller office there is more patience shown to me as a patient in the reception & pre-appointment care. As a patient of 4 years I would highly recommend this pain management center.|Dr. Thiminer is very nice, does a thorough exam & seems to know his stuff. However, the receptionists & medical assistants are cold, uncaring & dismissive. You will never get a call back, when you leave a message and if you can't get by the receptionists, you can't get to the Dr. It's bad enough, to be in pain. One doesn't need the staff to add more negativity to it.|I have a dear friend who went there with her mother. They were berated for being a few minutes late and yelled at-told them only one could be taken in. The other would have to reschedule. But she was out of medication. They told her ""too bad. It's a privilege to be here and you shouldn't have been late"" Days later, on the phone asking for their records to be transferred to another practice, given a hard time about sending them in a timely fashion.  When she called the new office that finally received the records, they said they weren't taking new patients, when prior they had said they were. The old office told them lies about her and it was basically their intention to have her denied from every office she might try and go to. She and her mom are NOT addicts. She and her mom are wonderful people with chronic illness who suffer daily pain. She told me the Dr. is great. But the office staff, especially Andrew Paulson APRN were verbally abusive. My friend, who has MS asked if he was minimizing her pain. He said yes he was, her pain was insignificant and there are others who are in more pain than her. Awful! Don't go here!!!!|I'm surprised about the reviews. I've been going to this clinic for years. My experience is:
If I am patient and kind to them, then they are likewise with me. Makes me wonder about the people who give bad reviews. Andrew has been extremely helpful for my pain.|I'm a brand new patient both to pain management and this office.

He listens carefully, explains treatment options clearly, and prioritizes patient comfort and care. Highly recommended!|Fantastic bedside manner! Took the time explaining to me about my problem which is arthritis in my back and knees and what we could do about. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to him!|My Mom is an elderly woman who has every one of her mental faculties. She began seeing Doctor Forzani for back pain.  She met with him weekly for nearly six weeks completing an ablation procedure. She completed one side, but before she could begin the other side, she unfortunately was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Over the next month with Yale, we had set the date to begin radiation and chemotherapy but the day after Thanksgiving, she was taken by ambulance to the hospital for SEVERE back pain.  She remained in the hospital for 10+ days, missing the start of her cancer treatments, and she lost over 20 pounds while she was there.  During her stay, incredibly stressed about her back issue now prohibiting her cancer treatments, I called Dr. Forzani and asked if he could order an MRI to figure out what was going on. Something had happened, she was in incredible pain, and she needed to be able to get onto the radiation table and lay flat on the hard surface for the treatment.

Despite the fact she was his patient and she had done multiple procedures with him, he refused to order an MRI without an ""office visit"".  I explained she was immobile, in the hospital, risking the ability to complete her cancer treatments at all.  It didn't matter. No office visit, no MRI.

Unfortunately, my Mom's long hospital stay due to her back injury had weakened her to the point where Yale felt the chemotherapy would be too much.  Now it was radiation only, a much less effective treatment plan.

On January 22, 2024, I wheeled my mom into Dr. Forzani's office oxygen tank and all for his required ""office visit"".  He prescribed Norco for my mom's pain, no MRI.

By mid-March, 2024, my Mom had finished Radiation and was trying to recover.  The Norco Dr. Forzani prescribed was making her sick to her stomach and she needed pain relief. The hospital had given her lorazepam which she felt helped her pain.  Lorazepam is an anti-anxiety medication. It is also a controlled substance and has narcotic properties that can explain pain relief even though it is technically considered anti-anxiety medication. I would think as a ""pain management specialist"", Dr. Forzani would know this.

So again, I called Dr. Forzani.  Even though we had (painfully) met his office visit request less than three months ago (Jan 24), he insisted on another one.  When I complained that we had just been there and she only needed a medication change, his PA came back on the phone and told me he wouldn't prescribe that particular medication for her.  I was talking to his PA because, according to her, he does not take phone calls so she would put me on hold, talk to him, then get back on the phone.  Twice this was the drill and twice, Dr. Forzani was completely ineffective, unreasonable, and refused to help.

For Dr. Forzani, ""office visit"" fees are his greatest concern even when his patients need him very badly.  The only way for me to summarize our experience with Dr. Forzani and the effectiveness of his ""treatment"", is to say that he should be ashamed of himself.|I initially saw Dr. Forzani in Nov 2023 and he collected an X-ray followed by an MRI. I was happy to follow these steps to figure out why I had so much back pain. He then recommended a lumbar steroid shot to reduce my back pain that was found to be caused by a herniated disc. Unfortunately, Cigna denied the prior authorization (typical Cigna move). I thought Dr. Forzani and staff would submit an appeal to have Cigna cover the necessary injection. I called his office and they assured me that they had already submitted an appeal and they would contact me in a month when the appeal was either accepted or denied. A month had come and gone so I called the office and left a message (4 weeks later I still haven't been called back) and I also called Cigna. Cigna said they never received an appeal! So I waited a month for no reason.

I decided to see a new orthopedic doctor, so I obtained a copy of the MRI report and a CD of the MRI. Turns out, the radiologist noticed a cyst on my right kidney (failed to report any specifications such as size, or simple/complex) and Dr. Forzani never mentioned a cyst at all! So I have had a cyst on my kidney for months without knowing. (The cyst is likely nothing to worry about but it would've been nice to know so I could get an ultrasound to confirm.) I looked at the MRI images myself and the cyst was obvious even to someone who has no experience with MRIs.

I am now seeing another orthopedic doctor who is more attentive so far. I will never be back to see Dr. Forzani or his radiologist again.|It's hard to find a good Dr. That actually  listens to you when you talk. He doesn't rush you out like must Dr's do. I highly recommend him. Desiree that works with him is also wonderful.|Simply outstanding in all aspects of medicine.

I was referred by my rheumatologist, and then sent for x rays, mris and nerve studies. I was then met with the PA who didn't seem confident that the recommended injections would work, but that he'd review with the doctor and call me on it. I never received that call. I arrived for my injection, was never explained anything regarding the procedure even after expressing my nervousness. I experienced excruciating pain, was in tears and I seemingly was told to ""please just breathe"" and felt very little support towards my discomfort. After my first injection I was given a second one which I didn't even know I was getting.. never knew I was being given two. Needless to say I walked out disappointed and terrified. I'd highly reconsider this office. I wish I did, but I took anoth ruler doctors word and let my nerves get the best of me.

Despite debilitating pain for over three years, Dr. Forzani and Dr. Clifford Doiron refused to prescribe effective pain relief, offering medication that didn't alleviate my pain and injections Dr. Doiron admitted would not completely resolve my issue. My complaints and requests for effective alternatives were disregarded, resulting in prolonged suffering and worsening of my condition. Dr. Clifford explicitly dismissed my needs for a stronger medication, prioritizing his concerns about addiction over my chronic pain stating ""I don't want you to get hooked on anything.""

I have severe lower back pain and upper back pain. I got an injection today for my lower back and now they want me to come in on Monday to discuss getting pain pills as I had been getting monthly until I had a family emergency in Iowa and was gone for a month and another emergency in Illinois and was gone for 2 months. The NP that was training actually said, "" we don't know what you've been doing,"" as she didn't trust me. I have never given them reason to doubt me. Never anything illegal in my urine. So here it is Friday for my injection and I had to make, yet another appointment for Monday to discuss medication. I was there 2 weeks ago. They also tell you all kinds of things on the phone and then you get there and no one knows what you're talking about.They make a lot of money having most of their patients come back 3 times each month. No!! A big NO!!! I do not recommend this pain clinic!!! They do not care about old people. I did get upset when they seem to think it's alright for me to continue with pain while they wait for a urine test. NP casually says we'll have you come back in 2or 3 weeks when we get your urine test back, as if I'm not having extreme pain. They do not care about old people in the least bit. I had an injection during this time and it did not help one bit. I've tried everything they want me to try. This place is terrible!!!|This place is horrific.  I waited 45 min at the appointment for them to then tell me it's a comp issue.  Long story short it is a medical issue.  Today when i left, the dr said they would call me that day.  Never heard from them.  In a week and a half span I called a few times.  Today they literally told me to stop calling and the girl that answered was extremely rude in the way she said it. Sge said rudely ""They would call me""  .Not even letting me explain or ask questions   I'm just a piece of paper.  I contacted the cold fridge human resources woman she was just as bad.

Here you are just a $$ and paper.  Not a human suffering.

Thanks for wasting my time!!!!!!|Very poor internal communication. Every time I go there is a different doctor asking for more information. Last time I went the provider said if you don't like it go find another clinic. Really the worst treatment I have ever received as a patient. I have a severe spinal cord injury and they treat me like I'm a drug addict.|I have experienced a lot of peace coming here,  and the employees are wonderful. Very kind and caring.

From front desk to medical assistant to nurses and doctors, they strive to be professional and keep their patients safe and healthy. They have rules to ensure we, the patients, have the best pain management aids available, and utilize them safely.

Other than that (which they really can't control), this is the best and safest medical group I've ever experienced. Safety and professionalism at its best.|My experience with Comprehensive Pain management was amazing, from the minute I walked in I was treated with welcome and respect. The wait was very short, they brought me in and the room is immaculate, the doctor and her staff were great, they explained every step of the process. After the procedure my 25 year back pain was gone. I will return as needed but 8 weeks later and I'm still pain free.|Absolutely horrible.  Every time that I go there, I ask myself why by the end of the appointment.  Dr. Chan is amazing, however, the rest of the staff, not so much.  Every time I go, there are new people working there, including nurse practitioners.  Hmmmmm.  At all of my visits with a nurse practitioner, they never examine me.  Today was the first time in 2 years, that I was examined!!!  Also, today was the very first time that someone has gone over my medications with me since the very first visit.

They cared for me for months in Stamford Hospital both during multiple surgeries and my lengthy recovery. I recommend them ALL without reservation. Including their front office staff and nurses - all so kind and so polite!!!|Follow-up post.  Staff at office location is inconsistent.  Many errors were made in processing refills for essential pain medications so that I did not receive my medication on time or at the correct location.  Many times I did not receive call-backs on essential matters within a timely fashion.  When I did not receive my medication refills in a timely manner and had to rely on back-up medication, I was treated like an addicted child.  Hence, I quit seeing this doctor.  Patients in pain should be treated with respect and in a timely fashion.  It is very hard to function when in pain.  If a doctor does not understand this, he should not practice pain management.|Dr. Wellisch had been my husband's (H. Aibel) doctor for many years.  When we page him, he always calls us back anytime during the week. He  saved my husband from having invasive pain killers  which his previous doctor had prescribed for many years ... My husband regained his mental and physical ability without having any invasive pain medications. Dr. Wellisch is a conscientious doctor. He listens to his patient and attends to their need with utmost kindness and consideration. Thank you ,Dr. Wellisch.|Dr. Wellisch is patient, thorough and a good listener.  With his assistance, I was able to get off other debilitating pain medications and onto a better regimen that helps me have a better quality of life and better clarity of mind.  PM is a constantly changing process.  He works with me and maintains great communication.  I feel that he actually cares whether I am doing better and that makes all the difference.|Fantastic doctor! I was so fortunate to have been referred to Dr. Wellisch over 3yrs ago. He is professional, knowledgeable and has a high regard for (my) chronic pain. My health issues are complex and span from Pain Management to other areas of medicine. Dr. Wellisch takes my entire history into consideration to treat effectively. He takes the time to explain the treatment options, in detail, often pulling up graphics to be sure I understand exactly what  procedures he is recommending. I've had many procedures with Dr.Wellisch and will most likely have more in the coming years. I highly recommend Dr. Wellisch. You owe it to your chronic pain to schedule an appointment with him and his staff.|When my mom was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for her cancer she developed shingles for the first time, and the pain she experienced from that kept her from doing most activities.  After searching for some time for a pain management doctor we found Dr. Wellisch.  I chose him because of his medical background and experience and affiliation with SHMG and Stamford Hospital.  My moms health condition at the time was complex as she had a lot going on medically.  Dr. Wellisch treated her pain with prescribed drugs which worked for her and got us through a very difficult time.  Our experience with Dr. Wellisch was very positive all around.  I found that he was kind, receptive and very professional.  On occasions when we met with this doctor after listening to my moms medical history he provided us with options and his recommendation on treatment.  If we had questions or didn't understand something fully he took the time to answer or explain things in more detail.  On a couple of occasions, based on considering our feedback to his recommended plan, he made revisions in his treatment plan based on our concerns which is why I gave him 5 stars.  I also remember that mom ended up in the ER on one occasion, I asked his office if he could come visit her as she was experiencing severe pain in her head, he did visit with her during this stay.  Support staff for this practice are very good and the facilities are new and based on the grounds of Stamford Hospital.  I would highly recommend this doctor.|Worst doctors appointment experience of my adult life. So unprofessional, made me wait for 35 minutes for my first appointment and 45 for my second. Only to be told that I was 10 minutes early. Fine. That's still 35 minutes. He treated me like a drug seeking addict. Told me to go to AA or NA meetings after prescribing me drugs to be taken daily and a weed card recommendation. He also told me that I had to go see a psychiatrist at Liberation house (a rehab and the same place he told me to attend meetings). In my opinion this man has not been taught or has not learned about pain management for people who are not coming off of heroin and are in actual need of pain medication. I told him how I couldn't wait to be seen that long, especially after calling ahead of time to make sure that he wasn't running behind schedule! He got upset with me because I said that in his waiting room. We then broke up mutually. Now I'm not allowed to see his partner which is odd because of HIPPA or HIPA laws his partner shouldn't know my name, right? Anyway, I wanted to warn future patients that don't want to feel talked down to or treated poorly by an arrogant doctor.|The only reason for one star is because you cant give zero. The office staff is second to none specifically Kelly, Patrick, and Jake. However, this so called doctor isn't worth the paper his degree is printed on. I am a veteran of two wars and several incursions that resulted in combat experience. I do not think that entitles me to anything other than to be treated with the same respect as anyone else. I waited for over a month for an appointment which is O.K. I guess a little excessive but I understand. I have several herniated discs in my neck, which cause chronic headaches and migraines, I have several bulging discs in my lumbar spine and degenerative joint disease in bilateral knees. All of this confirmed by imaging, MRI, and X-Rays. From the time this guy entered the room he was insulting, degrading, and totally unprofessional. I am on one medication, down from several high dose, high strength opioids that the military had me on and all he wanted to focus on was the medication, he NEVER addressed my pain issue. He insulted me and fixated on one medication for about 30 minutes then abruptly said he couldn't treat me. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this guy. Chronic pain is not joke, we are not all drug seekers and it is terrible when someone that is sworn to help people makes them feel belittled instead. Please for your sake and the sake of your loved ones stay away from him.",2024-12-31|2022-08-21|2021-02-23|2021-09-11|2020-03-03|2018-10-04|2021-07-12|2017-10-23,5|1|5|5|5|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJJw33u_uhwokRG3qKfI1UtkI,27

Thank you, Dr. Chopra!!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!|Outstanding physician who is so insightful, curious, knowledgeable, and compassionate. His initial evaluations are extremely thorough, which makes for a detailed report based on individualized observations that are then actionable and genuinely helpful.

Unlike other EDS ""experts"" we've now encountered, Dr. Chopra uses proper evaluative techniques, asks loads of relevant questions, and does not have preconceived notions based on other diagnoses. This makes him all the more rare and special in an overall medical world where patients are being reduced to check lists and dollar signs.

When we implement his suggestions, we see marked improvement. When we return for followup, he offers new layers and approaches to improve quality of life. We wish there were more doctors like him!|Dr. Chopra has wonderful bedside manners. He is very intelligent and knows his subject well. After having seen 22 doctors for my child (who gaslighted me) he spent almost 3 hours going through every bit of her symptoms and examining her. He was compassionate, humorous (which helped her feel at ease). It has been 10 years and I now look at my child who is all grown up with tears thinking what would have happened if we had not seen Dr. Chopra. She is doing very well and is medical school.|I am unable to make an appointment after they asked where I lived and what insurance I had. Donna emailed me back and said ""The Dr's schedule is closed for new complex patients"". Really unfortunate and disappointing that the ""Center for Complex Conditions"" can't see a new complex patient!

Edit: You never mentioned I would be on a cancellation list your only reply was ""The Dr's schedule is closed for new complex patients"".  Therefore, you made it seem like Dr. Chopra was never taking anymore patients. As far as you taking me off the cancellation list, thank you. Your lack of care and empathy shows greatly.|Dr. Chopra is the best doctor I have met. My daughter had a complex medical condition. Every doctor I went to would gaslight me. I went to Boston Children's, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic and they all gaslighted me. I finally saw Dr. Chopra and as I write this I have tears in my eyes. He was so kind, listened to my daughter and diagnosed her correctly. It has been 15 years, my daughter is starting medical school. She has gone from being bed ridden to a beautiful young lady who dreams of becoming a doctor like Dr. Chopra.|will be forever grateful to Dr. Chopra for saving my children's lives. They were both diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and my daughter also had CRPS.  Dr. Chopra was so kind and compassionate. He spent hours with us trying to understand what the problems were.  His guidance, kindness and compassion along with his superior knowledge have made a huge difference to the children. They are growing up fast. It brings tears to my eyes when I look at them thinking what would have happened if it was not for Dr. Chopra.  We had seen over 22 doctors before and they were clueless.|Saw him today! Best Specialist I've seen! They made my friend & I feel at Home. He took his time & his staff were amazing & hilarious! Would recommend to anyone suffering and seeking valid rationale, as to why?!?! I've been dropped by practices for begging for answers! One past provider almost allowed me to ""yeet"" this earth, by allowing me to slip into Rhabdo! I've been dropped by previous providers, due to my tendency; in relation to having true diagnostic, evidence based practice in relation to treatment goals and validation! Today, I had my prayers answered. It all makes sense and 36yrs of suffering, answered! If you are struggling, in search of a ""REAL"" Physician , to do a thorough exam and take his time explaining his rationale/reasoning behind it... Choose, this practice!!! ~ Jessica Dalton|Regrettably we never got to see Dr Chopra.

We were told that he doesn't accept our primary insurance (despite his being listed on their site). We explained that we also had secondary insurance, and were told that was fine and they gave us an appointment.
We also confirmed with our secondary insurance that they would cover the bill.

Then they sent an email canceling the appointment the day before saying that they don't take our primary insurance. They don't answer the phone. So my husband drove over, and was told that he clearly doesn't understand how insurance works. And they won't see him. There were two people behind the counter, no one in the waiting room, and they still weren't answering the phone.
It seems so sad to learn that such a beloved doctor has a staff that seems to completely lack empathy or professionalism.

UPDATE: As this review received a response that clearly indicated that the responder either didn't read or didn't comprehend the above. I will condense. Our secondary insurance agreed to pay for the visit. This was known when they scheduled the appointment. Then, regardless of insurance or not, two employees at a pain clinic spoke to a suffering man looking for help like he was an idiot. Shameful behavior.

Joanne an NP, saw me first, and was so knowledgeable and caring. Dr. Hummel, is excellent. He did a procedure called, ""nerve ablation"", on my lumbar area. It went so smoothly, and wasn't too painful at all. His assistant, Michelle, is really nice and helps you feel comfortable before a procedure. I had back pain for many years, and saw many doctors without any help. Dr. Hummel, listened and helped me. My pain has decreased at least 50%, or more. I can now move, and do things again!

Marylou is an excellent scheduler, she's always kind, caring and  understanding. The medical assistants are efficient and empathetic.. Dr. Hummel is one of the Best Doctors I have ever had. He is compassionate, empathetic and he listens, he came up with the best plan of care for me.
I was referred to Dr Hummel in 2016 by Dr Friedberg who is my neurologist. I had  unimaginable and unbearable pain. Dr Hummel came up with a great plan of care for me.
Dr Hummel has a NP that works with him, her name is Joanne, she is also kind and compassionate and empathetic. Joanne is also a big part of my pain Management Plan.

Was first treated with respect and good explanations of risks involved with injections. Even the injection was in part successful but only in part. He kept having me make appointments to return for another injection but then became very unprofessional and each time blew me off not taking responsibility that he just didn't get it right and was unwilling provide any further treatments saying they were too risky. If he was that incompetent and unsure of his profession then why bother to give me any treatment at all. Will never return to His office after this unprofessional behavior!|I spent three years in pain that was so bad, I stayed in bed except for doctor visits.  I went to pain doctors ar hospitals in Boston, Norwood, Providence, and more.  I tried therapy, hypnosis, acupuncture and any other thing that was suggested.  Nothing helped.  Finally, my GI doctor asked if I would try Dr. Hummel.  I told him I'd walk naked in downtown Boston during rush hour if it would help.  I was desperate.

So, I went to Dr. Hummel.  His first question was why so many doctors.  I told him about my search for help.

He started looking for various ways to help relieve my pain. Long story short, he was the first and ONLY doctor who helped me!  That was many years ago, and I still see him.  To me, he was, and IS, a Godsend.  He gave me back my life!

The staff  are all very friendly and professional. Yesterday was my second time going there, for a procedure to treat my back pain. The initial treatment was ineffective, so the doctor recommended that this alternate treatment be performed. Both procedures were carried out in a very professional manner, with the doctor explaining everything she was doing, step by step. After each procedure, I was instructed on what to do and what not to do, as well as when I could expect to experience pain relief. Follow up appointments were scheduled for two weeks later on both occasions, to document the results of the procedure. I'm completely satisfied with this practice, the treating doctor, as well as the staff members. I highly recommend this practice to others, who are in need of a source of pain relief.|The doctor Dr Shalmi does great at the procedure, however the constant check in after each appointment even though we come up with a plan of up to 3 epidural shots, or if the pain returns come back for the shot is unclear and unneeded. I do not want to do a follow up for something that was already stated should be done if this occurs. This place waste time with unnecessary appointments that last 10 minutes when the medical necessity was already documented. The only reason for this is a money grab to get as many appointments out of the client as possible. Go elsewhere.|I have been suffering neck pain for many years until I met Dr Shue .

From the very beginning, he displayed a lack of empathy and genuine care for his patients. During our initial visits, it was evident that he seemed impatient and uninterested, often acting as if our questions were an inconvenience.

Dr. Mammo administered one shot for my mom that was effective, but the second one didn't work. When we brought this up, he became defensive rather than addressing our concerns constructively. Recently, my mom returned to his office due to severe hip pain and difficulty walking.  Dr. Mammo stated that he didn't have time to give her a shot and referred her to PA  Brian instead.

After the procedure, my mom experienced severe swelling and bruising from her hip down to her ankle. When I called the office out of concern, I was told that Dr. Mammo was busy and that Brian would call us back. Two days passed without a response. When I followed up, the receptionist informed me they were busy with other patients, which made us feel ignored and dismissed. We ended up seeing her primary doctor who took  care of my Mom the same day.

At her follow-up appointment, I reminded Dr. Mammo about the swelling and bruising. He asked if my mom was on blood thinners (which she was), but instead of taking responsibility for not reviewing her medication list, he defensively claimed it wasn't in her online chart. I pointed out that other doctors always review her medications first, but this critical step was neglected by his office.

The final straw came when my mom asked what could be done to alleviate her pain. Instead of offering hope or a plan, Dr. Mammo coldly told her that it would only get worse and she would always be in pain. My mom was devastated and left in tears.

The next morning, her pain worsened, and we had to seek help from her primary doctor. Thankfully, he reassured her, provided treatment, and within a few days, she started to feel better.

Dr. Mammo has demonstrated a lack of knowledge, empathy, and responsibility. His behavior was unprofessional and heartless, leaving my mom feeling hopeless and dismissed. I do not recommend him to anyone.|I do not recommend no one to this man. He is racist. I am a black female who was referred to him when I went to the office. He act as if he did not even want to touch me. His receptionist is rude. They're very hard to contact. he's rude. He does not know how to talk to people he over. Talk to you, and he shoves you off like he don't want to be bothered. He's the worst unprofessional doctor I've ever met.|I had a very upsetting experience in Dr Memmo's office recently. I was scheduled to see Brian his APRN for a follow up on a nerve test Dr Memmo sent me for. I had arranged to see Dr Memmo after not being happy with my current doctor and wanted to switch to this office. The first appointment was very good with  Dr Memmo. He said he  needed to do some tests to determine what was causing my pain. He hoped he could help me as the previous doctor didnt. When I came for the follow up appointment with Brian, he stormed in to the exam room telling me that Dr Memmo can not take your case and I needed to leave now!. He said I've been seeing another doctor so I can't be seen in this office. I explained I made it quite clear that I am not returning to that doctor and switched to Dr Memmo. He would not go over my test results and said he would refer me to a surgeon to match my personality. He was so rude and condescending. I left the office in tears. I sent a letter to Dr Memmo that day. Then I made a call a week later to the office manager after not hearing any response to my letter. She said she would not be able to handle that but would prefer me to the CEO of the company and he would definitely be calling me Monday morning. I never heard anything from him or Dr. Memmo. How sad you can't call your patients back after being treated awful with no explanation!|Office staff is very friendly.  Dr. Memmo is pleasant and explains everything so you understand.|My primary care doctor referred me here for my spine on august 11th. I hadn't heard anything by august 24th so I called them. They placed me on hold for almost 10 minutes without acknowledgment. As a medical assistant, I would never work for an office that has such poor patient care. There's no reason why a patient who has gotten a referral should be waiting longer than two weeks for a call back. I also should not have been on hold for that long. Someone should have come on the line and spoke to me even if it was to ask me to hold again. Absolutely disgraceful|Met Dr Memmo on 6/14/2021 for the first time, if I could rate him 10 stars I would. He is a caring, professional and very educated doctor. He took a good amount of time with me with examination and answered every question I had. Dr Memmo came highly recommend by by PCP and a good friend. I was very impressed that he took the time to explain my MRI films with me, view by view. Showed me where my pain was coming from and why. He has been the only doctor that took the time and explained it so I understood it. I've had lumbar issues for 22 years. He knew I wasn't there to seek out pain medication, but a facet block. He suggested 2 facet blocks, which I'm greatful he didn't say let's do an epidural to start. Would recommend him to anyone who needs a good pain management doctor. The office staff is wonderful as well. Love this doctor.|I had a spinal injection for my sciatica pain.  It was the worst experience of my life.  The injection didn't help me at all. After the procedure, I was in more pain than before the injection.  Google the success rate of spinal injections and the possible complications before proceeding and if you do go ahead, ask for sedation and someone to drive you home afterwards.  This wasn't explained to me or described in the written material.

I went for my first visit a few months back and we are working on my chronic pain issue with Lumbar Facet Injections. Went for my second round of injections and have my fingers crossed it will eliminate my lower back/hip pain.

Update: Dr. Perry performed a nerve ablation and after a couple of weeks my nerve pain completely disappeared! So happy and satisfied with Dr. Perry and his friendly staff!|Injection scam office. Avoid. They just want your insurance so they can rip you off. No concern for patients, just injections! It's the new opioid hustle. What a joke! Come in for a consultation when they could answer basic questions over the phone, save your time. Insurance companies should read these reviews and investigate this fraud|The office was friendly and welcoming, the receptionist was very professional and helpful. My botox also looks great! Satisfied and happily would recommend this location to my friends & family.|If they do not agree to amputations a body parts they should let the client know before they even book appointment and make the client wait over a month just to find out. If they're not going to read the transcripts or pictures or want to hear any history of the limbs that are being amputated.
So let potential patient know.
So the patient has the right to know to let their specialists know that this doctors already biased and they should be no need for this appointment by this doctor.
August will be 20 years I've had 29 procedures and 49 ft surgeries on my toes due to a dropping a 22 lb of frozen turkey on it today happened to be a cold very cold day so my foot wasn't that swollen and Perry did not want to see any pictures of yesterday or anything in the past or any procedures I've had in the past because they weren't presented today.
Man handle my tours I have no knuckles I'm my toes and big toe is smashed.
he's only worried about today not anything that has to do leading up to today. so bias I wouldn't send my worst today happened to be a cold very cold day so my foot wasn't that swollen he did not talk to Perry want to see any pictures of yesterday or anything in the past or any procedures I've had in the past because they weren't presented today he's only worried about today not anything that has to do leading up to today so Dr Perry is too bias.
wouldn't send my worst enemy|Dr. Perry gave me my life back! For a year I struggled with unexplained chronic back pain. It affected me in every way possibly. I'm a senior in college, and this pain made my gpa drop. My mood wasn't good, I was constantly crying. It took 9 months for Dr. Perry to give me relieve, BUT he never once gave up. He constantly tried different things on me, because he genuinely wanted me to feel better. Dr. Perry always listens to his patients, and he will answer any and every question you have. I've seen several doctors regarding my condition, and some doctors doubted my symptoms and didn't even believe me. He never once did that to me. Dr. Perry is always happy and will make you laugh, which is great because when you're in pain, sometimes all you need is a good laugh. The medical assistant and receptionist are amazing! They're both super friendly and nice. They make you feel welcomed. They are amazing with getting you an appointment sooner, if you don't feel well and can't wait until your scheduled appointment. The location is great, there's lots of parking. I HIGHLY recommend this place! Thank you all!|I'm posting this for my husband. He wanted me to post a review because he was completely satisfied with dr. Perry and his staff at precision pain clinic, and thanks to his treatment with Dr. Perry, is now pain free. He was referred to this clinic after his chiropractor had been seeing him after a car accident. They had done all they could, and told him to get an mri, it was then realized he had some nerve damage that was causing him the pain. After going to see Dr. Perry, working with him, he prescribed the best course of treatment. After 3 visits he was pain free.

Painful injections. Went one week got an epidermal for my back and leg pain. Then had to go to get a blood patch done since I had been rushed to the er for horrific headache. Then they billed incorrectly. Sent me a bill. I called billing and she said I will tell rebill it under other insurance first then rebill your secondary. So she zeros out the bill in my name. I get a call from the office today cancelling my appointment for tomorrow until the Dr receives the payment. That they will call me when the payment is received to come back!! Who does this,!??.. I have same insurance for all my back drs and primary and medicines and hospitals. I have never got calls saying I had to wait till my insurance payment goes through! Do not go here!!!|I was referred to this pain clinic. I was told I had to do injections and / or any treatment he suggest and if I do he would help me with pain medication. He did an Epidural which didn't work. So second treatment was freezing nerves in lower back that should help for 6-12 months. It was a very painful treatment. It helped for about 1-2 weeks and I had more pain than ever. Next he did this again. Went though this painful treatment. He said if I felt this treatment going into legs it wasn't good to let him know. I did express it was to intense. He told his tech to turn it down, she turned it way up and it shot pain down my legs. He kept saying sorry as I cried loudly. I have NOT been the same since, so much worse than when I went in. He refused to help with medication at all as he falsely said he would if I got injections etc. He wanted to continue to do same treatment he was doing and failed to help. Why? I'm not a Guinea pig. Im a patient/ human. I said NO! I never went back and ended up getting a bill for treatments, I have insurance. When I called number on bill I was told it was refused, now I have to pay! I told this woman she billed wrong insurance and she said she would not resubmit to right insurance. I continue to get a bill and I will not pay it, for I have medical insurance and it covers that last treatment, and covered the treatment done the second time seen , third time was same treatment. This happened in 2020-2021. Now I have heard that he's doing and dropping patients if they don't get enough injections, cutting his patients off without notice that have been on oral pain medication for over 20 years!
Don't go to him if you value your physical health. Go elsewhere and report him. He only cares about himself and not the patient at all!|Creepy office. Painful injections like hell . Im also getting billed for injections i didnt get because i did not go back. Secretaries were very unpleasant too|I was referred to the Sturbridge office for injections in my hip and sciatic nerve! It hurt so bad I wanted to simply die. The doctor told me it's ok to cry, and what happens here stays here (he saw I was embarrassed) and it comforted me a great deal.
Today I can walk upright, finally after months and months of agony, I can walk upright! The pain is there somewhat as it always will be, but Dr. Farid helped me so I can be a better mom for my children. With my injury due to a car accident, I was desperate for pain relief!

I'm a happier person now that my pain is being managed adequately.  I'll never be completely pain free but I'm 50X more functional.  Little to no waiting room time. Friendly receptionist. During visits, he is attentive, he listens to your thoughts and concerns and he does his examination. I really am pleased with the care I'm receiving now. Thank you all at ITAV|I found Dr Kinyungu to be very professional, kind and caring. He really empathizes with his patients. He has helped me tremendously with pain issues. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for an excellent pain doctor.|I  have always found Dr Kinyungu to be a warm, caring true professional. He listens closely and makes sound medical decisions. I have been seeing Dr Kinyungu for over a year and he has helped me to attain quality of life. I would recommend him and his practice without hesitation!|I saw Dr. Kinyungu at the start of 2018. He was very attentive and showed true care and compassion for my situation. I am a double leg amputee and have nerve pain from years of diabetes and phantom limb pain from the amputations.

We tried two different types of medication stregnths. One was way too much so we tried a different strength and it worked mucn better. I am going back to see him this coming Tuesday for a re-evaluation and I totally trust he will take care of me.

I went to Dr. Perretz on the recommendation of a colleague who found his prolotherapy to be extremely helpful in relieving her chronic foot pain. Her husband also had success curing his back pain. I had been suffering from what my PT diagnosed as frozen shoulder. Major shoulder pain and a reduced range of motion. After 4 months of dedicated physical therapy with zero relief and worsening range of motion, I decided to try out Dr. Perretz. My first appointment was an hour and a half. After a unique assessment, he ultimately said my issue would best be treated with trigger point dry needling. I returned for a 45-minute follow-up a week and a half later where he performed more in-depth trigger point therapy. Within 2 days of that second treatment I was nearly back to normal. Now, 2 weeks later, I am completely cured and my PT just ""graduated"" me from her care. My mind is blown. And bc I didn't need prolotherpay, my insurance covered my entire visit and treatments. Dr. Perretz was not interested in pushing costly treatments nor is his goal to have patients return for months on end. He genuinely wants to cure people. I am so grateful to have found Dr. Perretz and have already sent 2 friends to see him. If you're experiencing pain and not getting anywhere with traditional doctors, please do yourself a favor and make an appointment.|Dr. Perry and team have helped my health tremendously. I saw Dr. Perry for neck instability and issues that dated far back. Dr. Perry was careful and listened to everything I had to say. He got to the root of my problem and solved my neck issues. He's a trustworthy doctor who is extremely professional and genius! Thank you Dr. Perry and team for getting me my body back!|I had terrible SI joint pain for 20 years.  I visited 10 different DCs and PTs over that time and relief was always temporary.   I didn't want surgery.   I knew I had to try something different, then found Dr. Perretz.  He has the perfect combination of training and skills I thought.   At first I was skeptical that alternative therapy would work.   In a short amount of time I am now pain free due to Dr Perretz.   I am a believer.   An incredible resource for our community.  He is a wonderful doctor and person.  And his staff is warm and welcoming.|Dr. Perretz is the BEST! He has helped me in more ways than I can count! My husband, my 9 year old and I have gone to him for various prolotherapy, neural therapy, acupuncture and osteopathic needs and we have all had amazing results! My 9 year olds bladder dysfunction that was quite serious was eliminated with neural therapy after all conventional methods had failed. We are so grateful for him and his compassion, listening and being a doctor who is truly different from the rest!|Dr. Perretz is one of the most caring and compassionate doctors you will ever meet. He will take the time to actually listen to you and discuss ideas. Never arrogant or condescending, simply interested in finding a solution to your problem no matter how intractable. Always willing to learn and provide honest feedback or admit he does not know the answer.

I will definitely go back but I do wish that Dr. Patel could have taken just a slight bit more time to address all of the information I entrusted her with. I will add that I had been sent a text message earlier in the day letting me know there had been a cancelation and asking if I could come earlier - and staff were lovely when I stated I just couldn't leave work earlier. However, they still asked I could arrive any amount of time earlier than my scheduled appointment (it was not to fill out new paperwork or anything of the like as they had everythine they needed). Thus, I do not know if something came up for the doctor and she had an urgency to leave. This did trickle down to my appointment interactions though.|The minute you walk into your office you feel welcomed, everyone seems happy!

I had an appointment it went well, so I thought. He prescribed a medication to take at night. I definitely explained to him that I needed something to take during the day that would relieve my pain and still be able to function. I called the office several times trying to find out if he could send something over to the pharmacy. It was extremely difficult when all I got was this mailbox is full no one ever pick up the phone the whole day! Thursday 12/19/24. The next morning I received a voicemail, ""hi this message is for (my name) I got a voicemail from you and I'm returning your call if you still have concerns give us a call back at 855-"".
Never said who she was or where she was calling from. Left me the same number I've been calling with the full mailbox. So I called on Friday morning a few times finally Bree answered with her nonchalant, I don't care about your pain attitude. ""I'll send him a message and if he responds I'll get back to you"". I'm not feeling like family. So I called back in the afternoon spoke with a very sweet young lady who said yes he responded and said I should ice it or use heat. I've been using all my tools in the arsenal, nothing has worked. That was the purpose in calling the doctor! Is it all offices in DE that have staff that don't answer phone calls/messages or respond in a professional manner. I'm done I've canceled my appointments and I'll find an office that I can contact and the staff is professional. Maybe he's used to patients that just want drugs, you can't treat patients with actual pain like they don't matter.|Dr Abdallah has been great for me, have been working with him for the past two years. Placed a pain stimulator for my back and leg pain. I've had no problems with the stimulator and my pain has decreased significantly. I personally recommend Dr Abdallah for your pain management program.|I can't begin to tell everyone how happy I feel coming to Apico ! Their entire staff are amazing !

She takes the time to explain things and she doesn't beat around the bush. I have had a very pleasant experience at her practice.|Two years ago, I visited for the first time, and my initial evaluation wasn't done by an MD, but by a nurse practitioner named Heather Graham. For the first time, she told me that my PCP-prescribed pain medication, Hydrocodone APAP 10-325 (one every 6 hours as needed), would be replaced with a 24-hour pill. Without getting to know me, she switched my medication to Morphine 20mg, to be taken every 4 hours as needed. The result was that I was left with only one pill that caused me to sleep for nearly 18 hours straight.

My husband and I returned to the office to inform them of this, and once again, we were seen by the same nurse practitioner. She then put me back on Hydrocodone APAP 10-325, but I was never contacted by the office to check on my condition after the medication switch. It felt as though their primary concern was the money I was paying, not my well-being.

On two separate occasions, I was scheduled for a lower back injection (nerve block) at the office. One month after the procedure, I was charged $600.00, but I was never informed in advance of the cost. It wasn't until my next appointment that they told me about the balance. The injection was performed by an MD specialist, but unfortunately, it didn't help alleviate any of my lower back pain.

In September 2023, after a year, I underwent a urine drug test I got the specimen but, I observed the cup didn't have any name. The clerk was rushing me because I was the last patient that day and they was ready to close. Because the clerk was an a rush situation she scheduled me for the appointment for October and made me to leave immediately that evening.

In the next appointment I went by mistake to the previous location and when I saw the place closed I called the office and they gave me the new address location but that was impossible to get on time. I arrived 15 minutes late due to a change in location from the original office to Blue Hen, and when I explained the situation, they refused to accept my explanation. They made me reschedule for November without any understanding or empathy, and during the process, the staff was laughing and making fun of me.

When I finally returned for my appointment, I was met with laughter from the staff. Nurse Practitioner Heather Graham informed me when I got in her office, that my drug test had come back positive for a controlled substance. I immediately requested that the test be rechecked or taken by blood work, as I had nothing to hide. To my surprise, the NP had already shared my test results with everyone before I even arrived at the facility. Then Mrs. Graham told me that I could not longer continue as a patient at Clear Way Pain Solutions, and she also said: that "" maybe if I'm honest I will find another place to go for pain management."" That was a very offensive, sad and embarrassing situation I had never had in my life. As a patient or as a professional in 26 years working as a RN.

After leaving her office, I went to the restroom, and from there, I overheard the NP discussing my situation in the clerk station where both staff and other patients could hear. This was a clear violation of HIPAA laws.

I had never used any substances that would cause a positive result on a drug test. While I have many medical conditions, I have never taken anything that would trigger a positive reading on a drug screen. Mrs. Graham never gave me the opportunity to defend myself as a patient, she could assess me and repeat the Lab work but she just said that's the policy, then I walked out from her office and immediately went to the restroom then I was able to heard Mrs. Graham laughing and talking in loud voice to the staff about me; mentioned my name so loud enough that I could hear everything from the restroom.

That situation was really hard for me that I started getting very depressed. I'm not recommend ""CLEAR WAY PAIN SOLUTIONS"" to anyone because you will not be treated with respect and dignity which anyone deserves to be treated. Without having in consideration the fact of race, religion or sexual preference.|Dr. A is great and communicates well, the thing that makes me drop give three stars at this moment is the check in process. They text you 2/3 days prior to your appointment and talk about check in now for your appointment. After you spend like 10/15 minutes checking in. You get to the office and they say you're not checked in and you have to repeat all of that over again. Very frustrating and very inconvenient. But my doctor is good.|They were punctual. No hassle with filling out forms upon arrival due to the use of the portal for completing your sign in prior to arrival. The doctor is very experienced and takes the time to explain everything. He even gave me a copy of my diagnosis for future reference and my personal file. He is also monitoring my previous surgery which has not returned after his treatment. Totally satisfied with my medical treatment.|Sadly had a very disappointing experience with a nurse. Even when the conversation was not even with her , she decided to the conversation with an attitude and rudeness. Very unprofessional and on top of that the Dr. Decided to speak about in front of 4 other patients, extremely unprofessional. After that while trying to check out with the front desk and cancel other appointments,she once again tried to interrupt the conversation and add her unprofessional attitude and conduct, all this in front of other patients. I did apologize to the young lady that checks you in and out , while she was trying to do her job the nurse decided to come to the front desk and escalate a situation that could of been avoided if she wouldn't interrupt a conversation between other people that dod noy include her. Unfortunately the Dr also was very unprofessional and cross the line when he tried to speak to me about the situation,out loud in front of other patients trying to check out or in.|I found the professionalism, Customer Service, staff  outstanding.   Dr. Ahmed attentive and caring.  This was first visit and extremely encouraging for possible pain solutions.|Doctor Lopez was in no hurry and listened to every word intensely.In my 60years he is one of a few doctors that genuinely cares about his patients. I would not
hesitate to recommend him to any one needing a Doctor in pain management.|I have had good experiences with the doctors and staff in the Dover, DE location.

I decided to try a new provider. And hands down, I'm glad I decided to use this practice. Dr. Abdullah has a very gentle touch during the procedures. The staff is friendly and helpful. To make comparisons of the injection procedures pain is usually extremely uncomfortable. However, Dr. Abdullah manages to make the experience almost pain-free. Always a positive atmosphere.

The staff goes above and beyond assisting patients.  The staff never ""brushes"" anyone off if they call in with any questions or help dealing with insurance companies/pharmacies. Dr. A & Erica always take their time to listen to a patient and I feel, they truly care about each and every person that walks into their office.   This is the only practice I know where they listen and explain everything.  It has been my experience with other doctors where the doctor sees a patient for like 30 seconds, leave the room to see next patient while leaving the nurse or other assistant to explain/review everything else or the doctor will just give you a brochure to you to read making you feel like they don't really care about their patients but this NEVER happens at this practice. I purposely tell them everything during my visits as I value their opinion more than they know and honestly I follow all their advice & recommendations.  I can't stop recommending this practice enough!|I'd like to give a big shout out to Dr. Abdallah and the APICO team. I was referred to his practice after a car accident to help with my recovery.

I highly recommend Dr. Abdallah and the APICO team.|Dr. Abdallah was very professional, and personable.  Additionally, he informed me of what to expect while performing my epidural. Furthermore, his staff is courteous and efficient. Suffice it to say my spinal injection was seamless with minimal pain.  Thank you!|I went in and was very nervous the first time. The staff were so nice to me. Ms.Erica actually listened to me and made feel so comfortable. She actually is trying different ways to ease my pain. I look forward to whatever techniques they will use to help me. I feel she really cares. I really love the staff and her.

I saw a NP there and she ended up quitting during my care and he didn't know anything about my condition and he didn't care either. He loves speaking over patients and offering dry needling but not actually surgery to fix the issue. My fingers are numb, I deal with constant pain, and now I have to add waiting on a new orthopedic surgeon to look at my neck.

The staff is great and very sweet but if you don't want to waste time and run around doing 12 weeks of physical therapy to end with being asked if you want another 6 weeks is absolute madness. Don't be like me - an idiot, and wait for this ""doctor"" to do something other than making your condition worse or drag you along. Now I feel like I'm looking down the barrel of a gun, waiting to see how long until I can't use my left hand.

After reading through the reviews it looks like most of the high rated ones are from car accidents. Do you get more money for those patients? Is that why you treated me different even though all my scans and MRIs and EMGs showed how badly I need surgery??

""Dr."" Grossinger, you should retire and free the public of your ignorance.|From a view of having been a fellow area physician of 25 years, I can say with great confidence that Dr Steve is THE BEST!
Beyond being superbly experienced and knowledgeable, he is kind, gentle, and a consummate professional!
Injections that most of his peers generate much pain upon administering , Steve's practically go unnoticed..Yet they really truly work!! Especially his regen therapies .. He's AMAZING!!|He is such a wonderful doc. I have been in pain for a very long time. Saw doc after doc that gave me pills. Dr. Grossinger took the time to find the problem. I no longer have shooting pains in my back. The PRP shots were a miracle. The ladies at the front r so nice as well. U know when someone likes where they work.|Firstly, I never write reviews however, I have to share my experience with Dr Steven Grossinger and his staff.
From the moment you walk in, you're greeted (which is very important to me), it's a very warm and welcoming environment. I've been receiving care through two motor vehicle accidents and to say that it was extremely pleasant is an understatement. Dr G suggested that I started a series of epidural injections for the severe back pain and sciatica that I had been experiencing. Honestly, I was sooo nervous, afraid and also skeptical of if it would work or not. I've had 4 natural births, so the idea of me receiving injections in my back was pretty frightening.
Dr G and his staff made sure that I was well aware of what to expect, allowing me to make a clear and solid decision. Once I made the decision to move forward with the injections, his staff made me so comfortable, answering my million and one questions and just reassuring me that I was going to be ok... and they were right. I'm so happy that I made the decision to have them done. I'm actually able do things that I need to do now, like run errands and stand long enough to finish making dinner,
Although the circumstances were unfortunate, I'm thankful to God to have the care of Dr Steven Grossinger and his amazing staff.|Dr. Grossinger is one of the BEST doctors I have ever been to. He is not only professional but is kind and compassionate. I have never had such a supportive doctor. He also hires wonderful people. His staff is great and in particular I want to give a shout-out to Heather. She is a lovely person that is so patient. She has been very helpful with all my administrative needs. I was referred to this office by a friend and I, too, recommended it as well.|I am a Jersey Girl and have been with Dr. Steve Grossinger in 2008. He and his staff have always been kind, and gentle.  giving superb treatment.    It has always been like one big family affair......which is also healing. I have watched him grow in all the latest techniques, procedures, medicines, and a variety of holistic approaches.  He will critique in a specialized angle...Just For You......His staff all listens and takes time with you like you are the only one that matters.  You do not feel alone in your struggles. He is concerned with the littlest things. He can see the best possibilities and give you options. You have the freedom to make choices and suggestions too!!!
Dr. Steve is a Visionary.  Thank You everyone!  With love, Lori|Very good n respectful doctor. He willing to help. I just wanted to say thank so much for all your service!|Dr Grossinger; Always excellent care.   Watches especially how I'm progressing after post  traumatic, serious, 5 facial fractures and skull bleed with drainage of 1//20/2018. Still ongoing. Evaluates  med treatment before ordering refill.

I've seen Dr. Witherell about 8 times since October 2023. Each time he has *listened* and responded positively. He even performs the ""Patel Pause"" protocol devised by a prior pain specialist to help rebuild my sense of agency and safety in medicine.

Few pain specialists have been able to recognize and respond appropriately to my needs, so I am expecially thankful that Dr. Witherell is up for the job.

Oh, yes, and he sometimes sings a bit in the OR when we listen to bossa nova during the SGB procedure.

I personally feel like he didn't really help me or my pain. He was persistent with me PAYING OUT OF POCKET( he told me insurance wouldn't cover it) for some sort of stem cell therapy. I'm on a fixed income and could not afford it. He said I was a good candidate for medical marijuana to control my pain and anxiety but it would cost $300 to go to the seminar and pay for the card. So, I had to go without pain treatment until it got bad enough that I had to go to an urgent care center AFTER I was directed to do so by a member of the physical therapy staff. I was forthcoming with all information from the urgent care visit with Dr Balu. He was upset and called his therapist into the room and verbally reprimanded him in front of me (I have anxiety and PTSD and confrontations are a trigger). After, Dr Balu seemed upset with me and told me I had to chose which place I wanted treatment from...his or the urgent care center. I'm still in pain and stopped seeing Dr Balu. I was even directed to his mental health specialist for my anxiety, Dr Dave. He was WONDERFUL but medication was limited and with life-long anxiety issues, I know what works and what doesn't. I tried them all. I was put on a medication that helped some but not enough. No one seemed to care to address the lack of sleep from the anxiety. I wasn't happy and can't really recommend Dr Balu.

With sincere appreciation,
John D. Bails, CWO USN-Ret.|I went to the office 3 weeks ago to get in to see someone. I am new to the area, and they said they were taking new patients. I did my paperwork in my car and then handed it in. I have not even received one call from them. I dont know how professional a place this is. When I called to check on things, I was rushed off the phone after whomever the woman was that answered the phone, telling me, ""Someone will call you."" Still nothing! I am very disappointed so far.|If you are referred here ask for another option. Dr. Anthony is always ""running a little behind"" usually having a 60-90 minute wait. But if your 15 minutes late for your appointment you will be rescheduled no excuses. Some of the staff are rude and have no empathy as this is a place of business. I've been coming here about 6 months and still experiencing pain which also tells me they are only after money they make for constant appointments. I wish I had chosen alternative care.|I've been going to them for years. Yeah it took a long while to find the Right Health insurance then the Right Doctor and the Right Information to figure what is going on in my back and hip with my pain.

Dr Anthony has figured out where my nerve is in my back that has caused me to go numb from the waist down.

Just waiting on the right insurance company to help pay for the work on my back.|It has been many years since I have seen Dr Antony and still get terribly upset thinking about the horrendous way I was treated. I had been seeing her for pain management and had tried many different injections as well as medications. I have MS and suffer from debilitating pain in my legs. The pain had become unbearable and, when I called her office, I was told she could get me in at another location the next day for additional injections. When I arrived I overheard her heated conversation with the office staff about my records not being there. She went ahead and gave me injections and right away I noticed she did them in a totally different location. I received zero pain relief from them. When I called the office and suggested that she may have done the injections in the wrong area she adamantly argued that she DID have my file at the time she did the procedure and it wasn't done in a different location. I continued to suffer  and I returned for my regular scheduled appointment with Dr Antony.   I was hurting and desperate when I told her that my medication wasn't helping me enough to function through the pain. She got angry with me and told me she didn't have time to prescribe something else. She said she had too many appointments, was overworked  and was a single mother and never got home until late to her daughter. She practically forced me out of her office. I left in tears with no prescription of any kind. Needless to say, my pain and my blood pressure shot sky high. My primary care doctor had to admit me to the hospital. I was screaming in pain and obviously suffering from withdrawal from the medications I had ran out of.  When I was discharged I was told by Dr Antony's office that I was no longer a patient. She was working with another pain doctor at the time and later went on to open her own practice. I should have gone to the medical board but just wanted to forget the whole nightmare. Please, please, please, do not trust this woman with your well-being. She should not be allowed to practice medicine. I would never have given her one star but couldn't leave a review without doing so.|My name is Pam Ferguson. I have been a patient of Dr Antony for almost 2 years. I am pleased with my care. Dr Antony spends time to listen to your concerns and offers treatment that meet your individual needs.
The support staff are great.
Wait time is short|I have been seeing Dr Antony since 2016 and have never had a problem with her or her staff. She is a very thorough doctor. If I need something she and her staff are always there to assist me with anything I need. When I had to switch from my old doctor to her and Sussex Pain Relief Center, I was really worried. Once I got a chance to see her and see how thorough she is all my worries and apprehension went away. She has helped me to be able to lead a somewhat normal life. I would definitely recommend her to my family and friends. Thank You Doctor Antony for all your help.|I left a raving review for this place after my first 40 days with them. I was thrilled to finally be close to pain free, thanks to One epidural shot.
However, soon after that when my epidural wore off & I was back in pain,  I began to completely understand why there are so many terrible reviews.
They don't care about patients at all in this clinic. In all seriousness I don't know how they are still open. I was dropped by them because I did my excursises at home instead of in a germ filled physical therapy office.
I mean we are dealing with a pandemic right now. Some of us can't take the chances that healthy people can. The patient Coordinator is probably the worst I've ever seen. She shouldn't be involved with patients at all.
Dr. Anthony is all I've read negative reviews on. Maybe the other Drs aren't as bad.
All I can say is be prepared for anything if you decide to look for pain relief in these uncaring individuals.",2024-12-11|2021-02-18|2023-11-29|2024-04-24|2020-01-22|2021-06-11|2018-10-17|2020-07-09,5|1|1|5|1|5|5|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What is the Doctors name that does Spinal Cord Stimulator?","All three of the doctor do SCS.",short_wait_times|pain_management_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJl05ZZrKUuIkR-tKFLQTGePI,73

My doctors were great. But when support staff won't follow through, there is an issue. I spoke with both of my doctors numerous times about my use of medical marijuana, but not one time did they list it in my chart. Now I've moved to a state where it is illegal and they have cut off my medication because I can't get any assistance from the office staff in having my doctor there, send my new doctor a letter that I was authorized to use MM. It's not right that I now get to suffer because people don't want to do their job.|This is probably the worst Dr's office that I've ever been to.  First of all, when I was checking in the receptionist gave me an attitude because I didn't have the new patient paperwork with me.  I told her that I didn't have access to a printer which is why I was there 20 minutes early like I was told when I scheduled my appointment.  She then proceeded to give me my paperwork along with a cup to do a urine test.  I was cool with that,  but was not given any direction on where to go or what to do with it.  Then when I was finally able to see the dr, she came in and handed me my MRI disc's and said,  I couldn't look at those because my laptop wasn't working.  She never once asked me about my back injury.  Never did any kind of examination or anything Never asked how it happened,  what kind of issues I'm having or anything.  She just wanted to schedule me for an injection.  I will definitely not recommend this place.|Well, I have to say my back got reasonably better after some shots - However I've have spent more time resolving billing issues and applied payments than I ever did at the doc.  This causing more anxiety and anger than I needed while still recovering - just got my latest bill today - haven't seen the doc in 10 months.  This was NOT an insurance issue - just their own internal billing - never do what they say, misapply payments and so on.  So in short - I'm never going back.  1/3/2017 Update - and the bills continue and have been sent to collections - about 35 bucks - they have no clue - go ANYWHERE else you can!|The doctors at this practice are the best at what they do. If you are TRULY in severe pain they will get you what you need without jumping through a bunch of hoops. The office staff is nice, friendly and very professional.  Do not bother going here if you are a doctor shopper or a junkie. They are legitimate doctors who treat legitimate patients.|The doctor was way off course from the first visit. The second, follow up visit to review the tests he prescribed was horrible from a customer service prospective. Office seems very disorganized and a lot of hurry up and wait...

The doctor is impersonable and, honestly, was disrespectful enough I felt the need to report them to my insurance company. Total fail!|How does this happen? I had a 9:15 appointment. Dr. Hu was running late which is fine. After waiting for 15 minutes, a guy walks in who missed his appointment 5 days earlier. I finally get brought into the back but the guy who came in after me gets seen first and is long gone by the time I come out. How does that happen?|The physician I seen Dr Rashid is a beautiful person she is patient, understanding and professional! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the staff at the call center I have been calling for days being put on hold leaving messages with no one returning a phone call!! Today I continued to call and after about 3hrs hours of my day on hold in 30-45min waits and finally spoke with a young lady who said Stephanie was to call me back because she is the office manager, so I waited and yet no phone call so now my script is expired because no one took the time to call my insurance to put a pre-auth in not to mention I have been without my meds for 6days!!! Finally I called again and spoke to britany and wow wow and wow this young lady came on the phone and said listen here you obviously don't know anything about pre-auth and kept going and going until I called her an ass for her disrespectful behavior attitude and being unprofessional and above all ghetto!!! This young lady needs to be addressed on every level and trained period!!|I have had a great experience with my pain management team.

I never said I was there for back pain.  The doctor never told me why there was any reason for the pain th as t I was experiencing (in my feet and on the side of my right leg from ankle toid thigh).  He said I had a problem with my C2 and C3 in my spine without an X-ray or MRI.  I feel that this practice is a scam.|I've been going to see Dr Smith and McKenzie for 25 years. They both are incredible doctors who truly care about your total health.
During an appt with Dr Smith last year we were chatting about life and she started asking questions about my general health. Once she heard a few things, she had me go get bloodwork done. Now because of her, I'm being treated for some issues that were bothering me for several years. They are all about your total health.|I'd been seeing Dr. Smith for years for my spine issues. She is an amazing person who really cares. I'm sad that she left. The front office staff is always friendly and helpful.|Went here for months. Was treated by Dr Anne with no results except the money gone that I gave them. The receptionists and back office are ruthless. Not friendly at all
Yes, and as others say, I was charged almost 200$ for obtaining my records.

Total disgrace,  money grabbing Richards!|Thank the Lord I relocated and was forced to see another doctor who shed a whole lot of light on things. Otherwise I'd probably still be receiving this inadequate/ineffective/inaccurate/dragged out treatment. I came to Beneck with injuries from being in an accident and he passed me around his office as if I was a dollar sign for all the doctors he works with. He asked on multiple occasions where I'm going to physical therapy and when I [again] told him where, he [again] informed me that he has a ""really good physical therapist I could see here"" and didn't seem to like it when I declined. Also didn't seem too thrilled that I didn't go to him for the injection I had. I went to his chiropractor 3 days a week for 2 months and I don't know why. What chiropractors do don't treat what I am diagnosed with - as I have been told by my current doctor. Acupuncture, physical therapy,  psychiatrist, chiropractor, X-ray, 3 MRI's a CAT scan... He sent me to everyone! Nothing even flirted with the idea of relieving my pain. He gave me a bunch medications that did literally NOTHING. I'm not sure if he thought that I was faking an injury because I'm young or simply wasn't the doctor I needed to be seeing. He expressed multiple times during my visits that I do not need surgery. 3 visits and and an in-depth explanation of my MRI with my new doctor, I have a date scheduled for surgery. This should have been taken care of by him during the 5 months he was ""treating"" me. Beneck failed me. I'm currently losing a lot of money because of his failure. Really dropped the ball here. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! I am very curious to know how much money they made off of me to do absolutely nothing.

Also- Beware: DO NOT MISS APPOINTMENTS! The curly haired lady who does the PT and/or the receptionist for the chiropractor in Glasgow medical center will make it known how annoyed with you she is if you do. Her body language, lack of eye contact and the ""oh wow you made it in today"" attitude was discouraging to say the least. She tried to schedule me at the end of the day instead of my normal late morning appointments because it was more convenient for her if I were to miss it. She made coming in very uncomfortable for me. FYI, I missed 4 appointments in 5 months... Appointments that ended up being a complete waste of my time but thanks for shaming me.

Aimee is the only good thing about this place. She deserves a raise.

*** This is my first time reviewing anything; Restaurant, book, amazon purchase, TripAdvisor.... a doctor office is my FIRST review. That might give you a little insight into how bad this place screwed me ***|This review is for my experience with the Dover location. This oganization cares more about money than your pain or concerns. I was referred here by another doctor for a test. I was told information was sent here and to wait for them to call. 9 days went by....no call. So I called and got someone on phone who had a poor attitude from the start. It was like I was a bother. She confirmed that my referral was left on someone's desk. She told me she needed management approval to schedule my apt because it was an auto accident policy from out of state.she told me that she would call me back next day. Well I waited till noon next day...no call so I called. She told me was still working on it and she would call me back before end of day. 5 pm came ....no call. Next day noon. No call back. So I called. She was very rude and really could care less about my pain or concerns. She was only concerned about insurance coverage. I asked her how much procedure was and if necessary I could pay cash. She still would not schedule apt without management approval of my insurance coverage. She assured me she would call me back before end of day. That was Friday....here we are Saturday...no call back and I am still in pain suffering because of her lack of compassion and empathy. It appears to me that this organization is only concerned with money and has a lack of care and compassion for your pain or concerns. The front office staff needs training in patient care 101. Seek help elsewhere!!!!!! Update...one week later...still no call back...if you need help...run away from this place!!! They don't care about your pain?!!|Doctor never looked at MRI I was asked to obtain and brought with me to 10 minute consultation.  No exam.  Simply said he didn't think they could help my back pain. Bill was $240 for nothing.|This place is a joke. They multiple bill you for Dr and surgery center. Even though the surgery center is owned by the doctor. They are not patient friendly and the drs don't have any bedside manor. It's like a factory in and out.,avoid at all,costs.

He won't lie to make you feel better, he won't beat around the bush. He is an excellent Dr and personally I would rather have honest than ""nice."" I am really happy to have found him when we moved to DE. EDIT: After a year of seeing Dr Kim I like him even more. As he relaxes with you as a patient his sense of humor starts to show and you can have very good conversations with him. Once again, I am very happy to have found him.|Dr Philip Kim has given me back my life. I couldn't do anything before I met Dr. Kim. Just sitting at a desk would cause me mind blowing pain. I was stuck in bed most of the time for well over 6-9months. Gradually I began to feel better and better. I am a functional and VERY happy person again. Having lost everything due to pain, no words can describe how grateful I am to have met Dr Kim. Go see him and let him help you. Live and enjoy your life again.|I was a LOYAL compliant patient..... for 15+ years. Went every month, and never missed a random drug screen. Then a couple months ago I had to have surgery. I discussed with Dr. Kim about him being ok with my surgeon giving me pain meds, and he said he was ok with that. But when it came time for my discharge, Dr. Kim did a 180, and refused to allow my surgeon to prescribe stronger pain meds (Dr. Kim  said I shouldn't need them for longer than a week......from a TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT!). Dr. Kim then said I needed to get off of ALL narcotics (which I have been taking for 15+ years for chronic pain......and HE had prescribed for me), called me an addict, and refused to write ANY more prescriptions for me.......basically forcing me to go COLD TURKEY, and making me go through withdrawal!
ANY doctor is better than Dr. Kim. He is uncaring, and incompetent, and should be sued for the emotional and physical pain he has put me through! Run in the opposite direction, and tell others to go to another doc!|I thought I was the only one who came out of his office in tears.  His staff was apologizing for my bad visit.. he wasnt even the doctor i normally see, he looked at my folder and said to me i see you had surgery for the 4th time so since i had surgery what do i want he freak out because my other doctor perscribed me 5mg  pain medicine  and said we do not do this at my office. I was deliberately put down for taking the medication made me feel like i was the one who did something wrong and hollered at me, something i really am not used to especially when I was in alot of pain and i left crying. He did do 9 injections on me though before my surgery,  my money was good enough then, hes a medicare scammer and will be reported. NOBODY should have to go through that kind of abuse  from any DOCTOR, if wants to call himself one. Please find another doctor since apparently he dont need patients..|For those of you that are having a hard time with Dr. Kim, I urge you to call his partner Dr. Michael Fishman .  He is located in Exton, Pa. but he is well worth the drive.  I think he has another location but not sure where.  His staff is fantastic.
Dr. Maryum Rafiqure is another colleague  of Dr. Fishman.  She practices in Middletown and Milford, De.  They both are great pain management doctors,  have a great personality and listen to their patients.  I no longer leave the office in tears, nor do I suffer from anxiety the day before my visit   Both offices have a great staff.|Great experience with Dr. Kim, he fixed a fractured vertebrate that was left untreated by my spine surgeon. Yes he is direct and to the point but I would rather have that then fake concern. He gave me my life back|If I could give zero stars I definitely would. He has the worst bedside manner I have ever come in contact with. Please do not go to this doctor.

They are very nice in the office and the doctor is very helpful and understanding. He's also good at what he's doing. The only thing I don't like is that they don't answer the phone or text messages.
Or call back. That's the only let down.|Always a great experience here. Everyone at every aspect of my visits are professional and personable. This is very important for me specifically because I need to see them regularly. Literally every person has been helpful. Not only do I trust them but I also like them and look forward to my appointment. Which, in my experience, is rare.|I've been living & coping with chronic pain for 26+ years, ever since the day I had a tragic ""slip & slam"" at work, in 1997. The injuries I sustained, during that unexpected fall, forever changed our lives as I gradually got worse over time, until I was in danger of becoming paralyzed from my neck down. See, I was pregnant with my youngest son when I fell and we were rushed to the ER/ED immediately afterwards because I went into premature labor. I couldn't get X-rays, have any tests done, or go to PT because I was pregnant. The nurses/ doctors told me to wait until 9 months after I gave birth, to allow my body to go back into its rightful place. By 2002, I had emergency surgery/ spinal fusion on my neck, they found my c5-c6 disc had actually ruptured & lodged in my spinal cord, so I became disabled by the time I was 33. Since then, I've seen many doctors, had endless tests & blood work done, been on meds, had procedure, gone to PT, ETC you name it... BUT none of the doctors I've seen really listened to me. I always felt like I was ""just another patient"" to call into their patient room, while they write out my scripts, and then leave.....

That was until I started going to CIP&S in 2019! They listen to you, they answer your questions without rushing you along or out the door, they really care & give you the undivided attention you need to discuss your issues. Not only that but they're extremely organized on how they run their practice. You don't have to wait 7 hrs, pacing in the waiting room, to see your doctor- like one practice I went to for years!

On my very 1st/ consult appt, at CIP&S, I learned more about my condition and how they wanted to treat me, to help lesson my pain and deal with my problems areas directly, then all the years with other doctors added together. I cried, I literally cried in front of my new doctor(s) when they were explaining everything to me in detail, things I didn't know- that I should have known, and... I didn't even have to ask them first. I adore all the doctors, PA's, receptionists, etc that I've met so far- from the Silverside Office and the Pike Creek Office.

Some procedures are done right there and the premise, which is nice too. You can meet each member of their ""team"" on their website and find out a little about each person and where they earned their degrees, which is always helpful too.

They actually shut down from noon til 1 pm every day, so all personal can enjoy their lunch together or go out, and take a well needed break. I have never seen this, at any doctor's office before, and I think that's awesome management to have.

They also have a answering system for all live ""chats"" or calls but everything is done by text. Once you are connected to the area you requested from #1-10, the live chat operator will come on and you'll proceed with texting, to chat about whatever you need to ask or tell. I especially like this because you can always refer back to what was said in your communication, and chat without having to write it all out quickly or have to constantly repeat yourself in the process- like when you are talking on the phone.

So yeah, I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. I've never been happier to go to my monthly appts... No more waiting forever to be seen- for less than 5 minutes with your doctor- and they take all your concerns seriously!

If they're accepting new patients and you are dissatisfied with your current pain management doctor &/or treatment... then text ""HELLO"" to make your ""new patient"" appointment today. You will not be disappointed... I  found the perfect doctor's office that has doctor's who really care about you and your well-being.

God speed my friend...

I thought my fatigue was due to my anemia how ever getting my jaw looked at they figured out my airways were small and that I was actually waking up several times through out the night. In conclusion I wasn't getting good quality sleep in a long time. I had x rays done and saw that my left side of my jaw bone was starting to wear down. I immediately was given a plan set up for treatment and I got a day time appliance and a night time appliance and I started to see a difference. Now 6 months today I don't wear my day time anymore I still wear my night time and I don't even wake up to use the bathroom at night! I wake up refreshed in the mornings. I have a routine now of going to bed at a set time! My life quality is so much better now that my jaw doesn't hurt and I can eat normally without pain AND not be fatigued everyday.

Thank you Dr. Lake|I had a 1-year follow-up appointment.  My sleep apnea has been resolved using the oral device and nasal surgery.  This was verified by a 2nd sleep study recently done by a different doctor to confirm resolution.  There was no way I was going to use a CPAP mask the way I normally sleep.  The device was not covered by insurance.  The staff have always been professional and helpful.  I met with Monica this time prior to meeting with Dr. Robinson and she was very friendly and helpful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because at time of checkout I was told my visit was a $150 additional charge.  I was not expecting such a high fee for a 20 min visit.  But again, the doctor and staff are great, the device, along with the nasal surgery, resolved my sleep apnea.|I paid 5,000$ for them to tell me they won't unlock my jaw and they IF didn't get the treatment I would NEED surgery. To give me a retainer that made my jaw hurt like it was fractured. And for them to give me popsicle sticks to ""help"" unlock it. After telling them that I didn't want to continue they told me that I had to sign out of treatment for me to sit on a call for a half an hour to talk to someone for less than a minute. They are a scam and they do not want to help or fix anything. DO NOT go to the pain and sleep center.|I had to write a review after my experience with this office, in the hopes that others are able to find alternative offices for these services that are more patient-friendly and concerned about your health over making money.

I was referred here from the dentist for teeth grinding during sleep. The initial appointment was a teledoc appointment, where they ask you the same questions you already filled out on 3 different forms, and then recommend you for an in office consultation. They also signed me up for an at-home sleep study.

The consultation with the NP was fine - x-rays were done, and the NPs who took care of me were very kind, professional, and helpful. After the appointment, the office director, Dana, took me into her office to discuss a ""treatment plan"" which consisted of a custom mouth guard and some follow up appointments where they do x-rays again.

I was told this ""plan"" would cost $3000.00 with no guarantee of insurance coverage for reimbursement, and was asked to sign a contract to start it. There was absolutely NO indication prior to this what the cost and insurance coverage limitations would be, and there was no alternative options for consideration, except to be put on a payment plan with interest.

As soon as I told Office Manager Dana I couldn't afford that, her demeanor completely changed from kind and coercing to cold and disinterested. I was promptly charged the $300 for the appointment that day, and rushed out of the office. I had to ask the lady at the front desk to get her to come back out to the waiting room to give me the info for my follow-up appointment.

My follow-up appointment consisted of them: calling me 20 minutes early, then putting me on hold for 10 minutes, then hanging up on me, then calling me back again, finally talking to the doctor.

The doctor told me nothing new except that I have sleep apnea, and just tried to sell me on the $3000.00 mouthguard again. I again reiterated that it was unaffordable and was hoping for some cheaper options. He told me (verbatim) that ""Maybe once I decide to prioritize my health, I can find the money to get the oral appliance."" and that I ""wouldn't believe how much money [he] has spent out of pocket on [his] health."" Must be nice when you can afford all the medical treatment in the world you want, while making others feel bad about when they can't, and charging them for the pleasure.

I have never had such a rude, unprofessional, and completely transactional experience with a doctor's office. I will not be returning here nor recommending them, and will be following up with my dentist as well as to why they referred me here. I've never written a Google Review before, but had to relay my experience after going through this.

And as for the at home sleep study - the pulmonologist who reviewed my results (from a diffferent office) told me my numbers were ok, I did NOT have sleep apnea, and that I should try losing weight first before going into any other treatments.

Save your money - go to an ENT or a different sleep center that takes insurance. Avoid this place and get a second opinion - their priorities are clear.|Had a consult with Ashley and Liz to evaluate my airway and trouble sleeping.  They did a thorough exam, explained everything and answered all my questions.  Susan was great going over my treatment plan and options for payment and the front desk was friendly and helpful in setting up my next appointment.  Thank you for giving me such a great experience!  You have an amazing team!|Summary:
I feel scammed by this practice:
They charged me for $3k for a 3D printed plastic mouth guard . My sleep didn't improve . They didn't ""fight"" for me on my behalf as they stated to me with my insurance.

I was recommended this practice by my primary care physician for sleep apnea (mild case) as they have good reputation. The office is nice , clean, and the staff are friendly. My real issue lies with billing/ insurance (I would argue deceptive practices/ bad communication ) and the end product they sell result in $3 grand piece of 3D printed plastic, that they exaggerated the efficacy on. They operate as a cash up front type practice and they submit the claim to your insurance after.Beware they promise you they will work hard to get the appliance covered by your insurance but a lot of insurances don't cover oral appliances as they aren't as affective as CPAP machines. They assured me they deal with insurance all of the time and they would submit a gap  waiver with my insurance since they were out of network. I was leary but I accepted as my sleep quality was suffering. They told me that the claims wouldn't be submitted until I recieved the device. I picked device a month later and I noticed no real changes in my sleep quality and after multiple follow up appointments I still am in the same place with the end product. The billing/ insurance end was a complete nightmare, there was a huge miscommunication between my insurance UHC and the practice where the gap waiver was not submitted or the insurance didn't see it ( both sides blamed one another) after hours on the phone and emails exchanged the problem got fixed. Pain and Sleep Therapy would sometimes respond super prompt to emails and other times I would wait a week or more which caused frustration as well. UHC ultimately rejected my claim and they appealed which the appeal got rejected as well and the response I got from UHC was out of network every time. Pain and Sleep Therapy pretty much threw their hands up and gave up. The back and forth was exhausting 6 + months and total. The end result I got was an overpriced mouth guard that doesn't work by a provider that was deceptive ( they didn't fight for me after promising to do so) and bad communication.|This is the best provider office that I have ever been to all the staff are caring. They take the time to listen to all of your concerns and not rush you through just the most pertinent ones. They take the time to explain everything to you and answer any question you may have. They even tell you to call them and ask them if you have any questions later. Dana was Assistant working with Dr Robinson today she is amazing. She's very sweet and kind she made me feel like she really cared for my well-being. Dr Robinson he's a very soft spoken kind man he's the first doctor that sat there and listened to me and explained to everything to me openly and honestly. Not only do I come to see him for my TMJ but my husband now will come and see him for sleep apnea and we will come back to see him for our routine dental work up. If you have any pain or discomfort or sleep apnea come to pain and sleep therapy center you will not regret it.

Always had the best of experience just always had to wait a good while. I didn't mind doing that considering how great a doctor that he is. But then the wait times became quite excessive, and like others have said Dr Falco just stopped coming in and seeing patients. If he had brain cancer I'm very sorry for him however they should have been honest with their patients and upfront with them. I had two instances there where my urine screenings came back positive for something that I absolutely positively did not take! I don't know how, why, anything at all about how this happened, all I know is I didn't take any medication then what was prescribed to me and did not mess with illicit drugs. The first time it happened they said they would work with me and excused it until my next year and screening came back clean, which I knew it would! Then about a year or so later it happened again! They discharged me that time, without any pain medication to leave with or any referrals for new doctors. I was livid! I would definitely say they need to get more doctors in there and they need to develop a system for your own screenings that is more than foolproof! By the way I even went home and took a Walgreens drug test and my system showed up clean, not a darn thing in it other than what I had been prescribed! I would not recommend anyone go here unless absolutely necessary|They lie to their patients. My doctor was Dr Falco. All of sudden he disappeared.I kept asking to see him.Was told oh he looks at your file when he doesn't see in person(lie)Was told he only working in the Newark de office and I would have to see him there(lie)made appointment to see him went all the way up there 2hr .ride one way.Got there the  nurse practitioner came in oh Dr falco not here today.They hid that he was not in the office cause he has brain cancer.They wanted to keep using his license to stay open.When they knew I knew what they were doing. I got a dirty drug test.Then said I couldn't fight it cause it was over 30days.Candice didn't tell me for days after test was done.I have gone to the state of de medical review broad to have them investigated. Very shaded what they did.|I was responsible for transportation of a patient. The wait times are excessive - never less than an hour late, often as much as five hours, because they purposely overbook appointments. [A patient witnessed staff discussing this fact.] The entire staff is (IMO) addle brained and quick to phone police the second a client dares question their perceived authority. I saw it happen three times in six months for what was non-threatening language and/or behavior. They treat everyone that walks through the door as though they are beneath them [translation: perceived as addicts and/or trash] and none of them are worth their elevated self esteem.

Patients with more than one type of insurance should carefully review their invoices. The ""surveys"" they are asked to complete on the tablets are only allowed to be billed by most companies ONCE yearly and other doctors' offices give such surveys accordingly.  THIS office gave patients the survey repeatedly.  So it appears that the office pads their pockets by surveying patients as many times as they have insurance companies to bill.|I would not even rate a 1,  but there is no other option.  I was seen by Dr. Flaco who seemed to know his stuff.  But if you have any life and do not want to sit in an office for 3-6 hours to be seen by him even though you have an appointment i would extremely recommend not going to this jack____.  My first appointment was at 8:40 am.  I did not leave until 1:30pm.  I thought maybe this is a fluke and would not happen again.  I went to my next appointment that was scheduled for 1:50pm.  Waited until 2:30 pm and heard someone say they were still waiting to be seen from a 10:30 am appointment.  I went to counter to see if this was true, sure enough it was.  If i would have stayed i would probably have been there until 7pm that night.  I asked for my notes from first visit.  I read later to find that thye were incorrect.  I called to have it changed, was told make an appointment.  Are you freaking serious!!! I rescheduled for a 8am appointment which took me 3 weeks to get, thinking first in first out probably take 30 min.  Wrong!!!!  I did only wait 2 hours that day.  Had to take PT for 4 weeks then make a follow-up which i did, once again for 8am.  Well we had a snow storm and they cancelled appointments.  I left several messages to have someone call me back.  Finally called office up North to reach someone who scheduled another 8 am appointment.  This was yesterday.  I went in at 8am which they leave a message stating to be there 30 min. prior if you are having a procedure.  I was getting a test done.  The nurse finished with me by 830am and stated not sure when Doc would be in.  He comes from Chadds Ford, PA.  I finally heard his voice at 930 in the lobby, that right he got there at 930am when he had patients scheduled for 8am.  So i waited a few minutes for him.  He never showed.  I asked the nurse at 1015 where he was, she stated she was not sure where he was.  I got up and told her to let Dr. Flaco know he could kiss my _ _ _ and i would never be back!!!!!!!!!!!!  PS the office is also filthy, the water dispencer was replaced with a stand alone.  There is a big hole in the wall which looks unsafe.  Very unprofessional.  Should be reported to health board.  Good luck if you choose him.  Hope you are very patient.|Wait time used to be bad. Now he sees patients 2 days a week and I haven't had much wait time since in the Milford office. The staff are all very nice people too. All of you people commplaining about wait time then go elsewhere. Dr Falco is an excellent doctor that's why it's so crowded. He is one of the top spine and pain doctors in the United States. If there is a wait time it's worth it.|I was referred to Dr. Falco by my PCP.  The first time, after a four hour wait, he came to the exam room.  I specifically and carefully told him the drugs I am allergic to.  My next visit was with Deb Streeter, P.A.  she entered the exam room totally disheveled.   First thing she did was write a script for the one drug that could kill me.  It was a different brand so I didn't recognize it.  I became exceptionally ill with my creatanin rising to 3.5.  I was in kidney failure.  Our final visit was a shouting match with her and Dr. Falco.  Ms. Streeter purged her file so it didn't show those two scripts.  Walgreens has the records.  I will be filing with AMA and Med Malpractice.  I would never wait for any physician more than 20 mins.  Should you care about your health, find a board certified therapist.|Deb is the absolute worst doctor. My doctor is suppose to be Dr. Falco. He is amazing and takes time to look at his patients records. However, he takes on a lot of patients so you then have to see other doctors instead. Now he has been out for several months which is unfortunate but I'd rather him get better. Those other doctors, however,  don't care because you aren't their patient. They don't take the time to review your history. The CDC thing where you are only suppose to be on X amount of medicine that is equivalent to 90mg of methadone is ONLY a GUIDELINE. It is not a rule or law or anything like that. The paper specifically says guideline. Now having 14 surgeries, a heart surgery, nerve damage from my waist down, chronic Crohn's disease, Lupus, 76 hospital stays.. I think that justifies being on a pain regimen to help with pain. If your medical history can clearly show and prove the reason you are on the medications you are on then clearly that is enough but if these doctors who aren't even your actual doctor are just going to up and change your medications, not look at your previous medical history, not look at the fact that Dr. Falco has IN FACT done everything by the book that he was suppose to and we tried other medications that did not work, having Crohn's disease and an ileostomy bag justifies why a patient is unable to take long acting medicine therefore if long acting can not be given then the break through medication needs to be adjusted accordingly. If I have clearly tried the medications and they did not work so MY DOCTOR DR. FALCO, change my medicine and adjusted it accordingly to give me RELIEF FROM PAIN SINCE THAT IS YOUR JOB AS PAIN MANAGEMENT DOCTORS then if he is unable to see me and I have to be seen by another doctor, that doctor SHOULD NOT just go and start changing medications because she feels like it. If she would take the time to actually look at what Dr. Falco has wrote and has previously done she would see that she is literally back tracking and putting a patient back to a point where they are in pain that Dr. Falco tried to get me out of. It literally is absurd and unreal what Deb did if she is even a doctor or whatever she is. She couldn't even tell me one thing about me, my medical history or anything so she didn't even look at my medical history or what Dr. Falco has already done and just changed the medication because she felt like it. Unless you are seen by Dr. Falco, these other whatever they are that see you could careless. So many patients are leaving and have already left. It is such a shame that Dr. Falco is unaware of what these or wanna be doctors are doing to his practice.|I brought my grandmother June Morris to Dr. Jie Zhu today, 11/22/16 in Newark, driving ONE and HALF HOURS. This doctor is what I think about when I live in Argentina and Bolivia for 3 years (3rd world). The mentally is, they don't pay for health care, so why should I care. He tried to tell me my 83 y/o grandmother was suicidal because she wanted to live in heaven instead of earth. If you don't know by now Dr. Zhu that people that age are very comfortable talking about death and dying. They talk about being ready for heaven, etc. I explained to him on more than one occasion she has 24/7 care, no means, no intent, no plan and my grandmother repeatedly laughed at him when I asked her if she was going to harm himself. On a side note, we live in Sussex County, she and my grandfather have rifles and handguns all throughout the house for years, if she was truly suicidal, she would have killed herself a long time ago.
We ended up having to go to the ER because this doctor thought a psychiatric evaluation would be appropriate for an 83 y/o with vascular dementia. I really don't know how he sleeps at night. I want something done about this. This practice SHOULD not stand for a doctor to treat a new patient in that manner. This is what is wrong with our system. You are suppose to be lower hospital admissions not increasing them. We go to the PCP, refers to a pain management, he does nothing, so what's next? The Hospital. So they gave her IV dilaudid and ruled out any suicidal ideations because she has NO mental health background, neither does her mother nor her mother.
Dr. Zhu said, ""go ahead and sue me"" while I was there, as if that is some threat. Listen I don't believe in suing people, I believe in right and wrong. And as the advocate for my grandmother who can't do it herself, I will file a report against your license. And I will write EVERY single bad review about you and this company until I die because you don't deserve to be in that position.",2024-08-28|2021-12-02|2019-08-23|2018-03-30|2017-08-21|2019-08-21|2019-03-07|2016-11-22,1|1|1|1|5|1|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",82|79.4|72.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJUfZLsQaauIkRintPVv05ZAk,19

Unfortunately, I wasn't adequately informed about what to expect, which left me feeling vulnerable and unnecessarily stressed.

Trauma-informed care is not just psychological; it is deeply neurobiological. When patients are not prepared for what is about to happen, their nervous systems can enter states of hyperarousal or dissociation, which undermine healing and trust. For example, I wasn't told in advance that I'd be lying face down for most of the procedure or that access to my legs up to my knees would be required. A simple heads-up or guidance about wearing appropriate clothing would have reduced discomfort and prevented the feeling of being caught off guard.

During the procedure, the lack of verbal communication further added to the discomfort. Even small actions, like approaching to listen to my heart and lungs without explanation, triggered dissociation. Clear verbal cues--such as ""I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now, is that okay?""--would have allowed my nervous system to prepare, reducing stress and the need to dissociate.

This was particularly challenging during the needling and EMG. While I wasn't bothered by the procedure itself, the absence of simple phrases like ""I'm going to poke here now"" or ""Are you ready?"" left me feeling overwhelmed and objectified. Providing these small verbal cues would have given me a sense of control and reduced my nervous system's stress response.

The experience underscored how essential clear communication and informed consent are as tools to help patients regulate their nervous systems. These simple adjustments--providing clear instructions, explaining what will happen next, and ensuring patients feel a sense of agency--can make a world of difference for patients, particularly those with medical trauma or PTSD. I hope the practice considers adopting more trauma-informed approaches, as they would benefit not only the patients but also the care relationship overall.|Do yourself a favor and do NOT go here. They must of paid for these ""raving"" reviews. They are not professional and do not respect people's time at all. Richard will schedule you while he is talking on the phone and do not put your info in the system. Show up for appointments to be told that the doctor isn't in or swearing me up and down that its not my appointment day. This has happened three times. They do not even have enough courtesy to call the patients and let them know something has changed. This entire office is incompetent. Surgery was supposed to be scheduled for me today but after this I don't feel comfortable with them doing a procedure on me when they can't even keep appointments straight and the doctor awake!!!!! Do Not entertain this practice, you have been warned!|Infinity Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation has been nothing shy of amazing. Rich is warm, welcoming, and so helpful. Dr Zelefsky is patient, kind and understanding. Both have really provided me with a level of care that has been personable, professional, and most importantly comforting.

I was involved in an accident that has been pretty traumatic.. From the total loss of my car to the physical pain and changes in my mental health, it has been a very difficult time for me.  However, coming to this office has restored my faith in medical practice of true genuine and caring providers who don't look at me for my past, but as an individual, and patient with a complex history they're willing to work with and aide in finding comforting resolution.

Truly, I can not thank them enough for proving me with this level of care.

5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommend.|The quality of care I received at Infinity Physical Medicine & Rehab was top notch.

They also offer ride services to patients!|I have to be honest, the front desk staff is polite, the doctors are polite and, as far as I could see, the staff in the back are polite as well. However, the services provided are not effective. I think that it is painfully obvious that the main concern is not you feeling better. The main goal is to receive money from your insurance. I'm sure everyone there has been in an accident. Not to mention, the chairs look very unclean and old and with bed bugs and things going around, it just doesn't feel like a comfortable environment.|The front desk staff and doctors are very welcoming. However, in the back other than Ms. Susan and another older lady whom I've only met once. They are very unprofessional, they don't even give you the full amount of your useless treatment. I'm in more pain than when I started. Whatever it is they are doing is absolutely NOT EFFECTIVE. It's just a scam to get your insurance money. I'm seriously looking into treatment elsewhere.|I really like this place a lot. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. Both Dr. Chris and Dr. Ryan are always willing to go above and beyond to try to fix what's going on with me. They're super thorough and give very good advice on how to maintain my adjustment once I leave. I don't have very much experience with the other doctor there but when I have seen him he was always very nice and respectful.|The best part is the free pretzels. Very slow staff ,
You can over hear their personal conversation while you're being treated on . I shouldn't know you went to John John house this past weekend ! Staff stays with stink faces and the other people who are being treated is ghetto ! Not my
Fav place and don't recommend|Horrible staff from the front desk and the back.. I don't know why my attorney even matched me up with these people lack of communication, lack of bad service, lack of just circus clowns staff that talks about people that's being treated here. I would not recommend them to anyone absolute worse|VERY BAD PLACE FOR CARE!!! Chris Young is a joke, as a so called doctor!  Chris Young does not care about you. He is a heartless person! There is no care at this place!!!!!!!
IF YOU WANT TO GET WELL DON'T GO HERE!!! Go some where else!! THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY, $$$!!!!  Very depressing place to go!! You won't get better!!!

Ladies were wonderful at the front when checking in. Unfortunately though when asked to pay my $75 copay I had told the lady I did not get paid this week so asked to get billed. I did not have a problem paying once I received the bill BUT I could not afford this copay at the time. I have never had a problem getting billed EVER at any medical practice. I'm a 26 year old who is dealing with loss of disc height with extreme lower back/leg pain with numbness to my legs. I've had many appointments with other doctors before seeing Dr. Glassman for my issues. I had to wait to get into this office for an appointment. I also work in the medical field so it is hard to take off work to even have my appointments. Lady who runs the front desk said if I was not to pay today that I would have to reschedule and they would not see me. I was forced to basically overdraft my banking account to be seen which now puts me in a financial bind. I'm not one too write reviews nor complain but personally I think this was wrong to do to any patient. I had stated prior that I've been to many appointments before seeing this office in which I was billed for all of my copays to take care at a later time when I was paid again and could afford it. If this practice seriously does turn away patients for not paying DAY of service they should state that when the appointment is made so nobody else runs into this issue and left just as upset as I was. I did not plan to not have the money but life sure does through wrenches into lives. Hence why I did not have the money. Again Dr. Glassman was a great doctor but the office needs to maybe make patients aware when booking.|I had an EMG August 22, 2023 and my doctors office has yet to get the results. I now have to take time out of my day to go to this office and get a copy, meanwhile, I am still in excruciating pain. Would not recommend going to this place to anyone!|Dr Glassman is really great. These guys even called and left a telegram saying Happy birthday|I have been trying to schedule an appointment with this office for several weeks. The front office manager stated she would call me back on two separate occasions. She never called me back I had to call the office and every time I called the front office manager never remembered my name or that she was to call me after the Dr received my records so we can schedule an appointment. I would never recommend this facility because they do not seem to care about their patients or potential patients at all.|Never got a appointment? Not Professional at all.

When you are his patient you are part of a team and an active participant in your treatment plan.His ability to actively listen to your concerns and collaboratively set goals is outstanding. He is very patient and explains everything in easily understood terms. He looks at you when you speak, not as his computer. You never feel rushed. He honestly cares about assisting you with your recovery and improving your quality of life. He understands that pain is a lot more complex than injury to tissue, muscles or body parts. He has introduced me to the Curable program which has been an invaluable tool in my recovery journey. You need to be willing to do some hard work but if you do you will be rewarded with amazing results. He acknowledges that he is constantly learning and a lot of that learning comes from patient feedback. He isn't afraid to admit when he doesn't have an answer, but will get that answer for you. I can tell you based on my 42 years of nursing experience how truly rare these traits are. I would absolutely recommend Dr Christian, and his staff, to anyone without reservation!|Dr Christian is a wonderfully caring doctor, incredibly knowledgeable and makes me, as the patient, feel inspired to work very hard at recovering.  He gives me hope in such a  way that me believe I cannot fail. He listens well and takes the time to answer questions - for me, there are lots of them - and never makes me feel as if he is rushed

He is so humble and respectful to alternative modalities. He is truly a gift to the world of healers.    He REALLY cares and is intuitive to look into your soul and provide you with what you need.    This is almost unheard of in medicine, unfortunately. I can't say enough of the Man and Doctor he is. He should have 100 stars.|I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Christina! Dr. Christian and staff are wonderful! I'm so glad I was able to find them. I drive just under an hour to see him! Dr. Christian is the only doctor that actually sat and listened to me, believed me and is helping me. I suffer from debilitating migraines and he has helped me cut the amount I get a month in half. He has also helped me with my shoulder issues. If you are reading this because you are not sure, PLEASE consider giving him a chance!! He is truly helping me!!!|Dr Christian has been my doctor for several years now. I was unable to walk when I first met him. 5 years later I am able to walk and I am again a functioning beyond anything I would have dreamt would be possible. I am walking again and also driving.

Please allow Dr. Christian help you should you need his guidance.|I have been to a lot of different doctors and Dr. Christian is the best and he is my favorite doctor  I have been seeing him for four years, now. He is very caring and a good listener and he never rushes you out of the exam room. I  would gladly recommend Dr. Christian to my friends and family knowing that they will get the best of care.|Dr Christian is a fantastic pain management doctor. He looks a you holistically and is very compassionate and understanding. He listens to you and works with you to come up with the best treatment plan for you. Even if it requires referring you to another doctor. I have had 3 spine surgeries with constant epidurals and rhizotomies in between them. My last surgery was 3.5 years ago and afterwards  Dr Christian came up with a new plan for my muscle spasms. It has been a life saver for me, as my falls had been less frequent for me and I haven't needed any additional therapy besides what I do at home. Plus the best part is, I do not want to be on narcotics yet and he respects that and treats me without ever needing to use a narcotic! He truly listens to you and works with you, to care for you!
