I couldn't sleep at night with my shoulder pain. It's all gone now.  It actually started feeling better after the first few treatments.

I realize the treatments can't do anything for arthritis I pray the growth going on will work to off-set it. I would highly recommend QC Kinetix|Before going to QC Kenetix I was unable to walk long distances or stand for long periods of time due to severe back pain from arthritis. Cortisone injections didn't work. I was unable to enjoy playing with my grandchildren. I was extremely fatigued and didn't sleep well due to severe pain. The idea of having surgery frightened me. I have heard too many horror stories about surgery. Also the idea of long term down time does not work fork for due to being single and having many animals to care for. Instead of being able to carry hay bales or bags of feed I had to recruit friends to help me. I love my independence so it is very difficult to have to rely on friends. Now that I have had several treatments my sleep is better. My energy level is out of this world. I can again take my grandchildren to the park and enjoy it!!  I can also enjoy gardening and caring for all my animals. I highly recommend Jason at QC Kinetics. He is very knowledgeable and personable   He explains things well. Love my results|I am writing this review for my 75 year old dad.  He started this treatment because his mobility had diminished and it was affecting his daily life.  We were looking for a solution and he did not want surgery. He started treatment with QC Kinetix and it has already been a game changer for him. Jason and all of his staff are truly awesome! They provide a cutting edge type of medicine with a provider you can tell really does care.  I am so thankful that he went this route! He is back to taking his morning walks and back to his old self! It is more than worth the money! I highly recommend QC Kinetix!|Very satisfied. Started with severe pain in my knee. After all scheduled treatments I am 100% pain free.

Highly recommend. He did nerve ablations that helped me with the pain. Prior doctors just prescribed drugs but he addressed the root of my problem. Also he takes the time to listen to you and discuss things instead of hurrying along. Great physician.|Dr. Moyse has been nothing but amazing!!
He has worked hard to figure me out and never stopped when things didn't work.
Most people would give up but he did not!!
I highly recommend him!!|Dr. Moyse has been wonderful!  He is treating my very difficult disease with ketamine infusions.  He is so kind hearted & has not given up on my progress, though I was slow to respond.  The nurses & staff are also wonderful & caring!  I feel so lucky to have them as part of my care team!|Really enjoy Dr. Moyse. He listens to what I have to say. A doctor that actually listens:)  He will try different medical options till one works or at least reduces pain. I have stumped him a few times medically and he still finds a way to help. He has a great personality and treats you like family. If only all doctors could be like him.|He knew my history before he walked in the door! Kind to me, as well as my husband. Have told many I am so glad I finally decided to try the pain clinic, and to have gotten Dr. Moyse!|My cousin was not listened to by the staff nor Dr Moyse. She'd wanted to get off of methadone, which she'd been on for 30 + years due to chronic pain. She was very thin, weak and had suffered a brain bleed due to car accident.  Dr Moyse dropped her off of methadone in a week and a half.
She suffered massive withdrawal symptoms, until helped by any prescription meds to help.
I've threatened to contact the Iowa Med Board. Beware of their treatment code prior to going to see this clinic.|I have been seeing Dr. Moyse since June 2017. I have major back problems and the insurance company and Dan have  gone through the progress of helping me get out of pain. Friday I had the nerves on the left side of my back burned and in 2 weeks I will have my right side burned. Everyone has been so nice and professional. I have no complaints about Dr. Moyse. So far he has been a very compassionate and supportive Doctor. If something should change I will give another review. I want out of pain. I was on pain medication and I stopped taking it February 25th last year. This country has decided not to prescribe any form of pain relief for the many people who live in pain every single day of their life. I have the issues with my back and cause problems with my legs. So I am hoping this procedure works. I don't want to have to take pain medication.....WHICH I WILL NOT BE GETTING ANYWAY.  THIS SCREWED UP COUNTRY IS MORE COMPASSIONATE ABOUT ANIMALS THAN THEY ARE TO HUMANS. PEOPLE WILL TURN TO STREET DRUGS, ALCOHOL WHATEVER THEY CAN GET. THOSE OF US WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE SUFFER FROM THE IDIOTS THAT OVERDOSE.

They knew she was dropping us off. I had told them this on the phone when i made the appointment but they said this was something new they started, so they would not take us for our appointment. We waited for an hour for my daughter to get back from her Dr's appointment to pick us up. While in the waiting room, the staff vacuumed, talked loudly and laughed.  They have always been very unprofessional there but we just put up with it. On our last visit 2 weeks ago the nurse and the receptionist ran to the window to ""make sure"" our driver was there and we didn't  drive ourselves. In the past they had told me they have chased people down in the parking lot because they were driving themselves and did not habe a driver. I just go and get a shot in my butt. I don't need a driver when i get  over  75 injections in the veins in my legs in iowa city!!! I guess they  think they know more than iowa city!!

They have used the word frickin on many occasions. They charge you a sur charge for using a credit  card. The only reason I kept going there is because this is where my Dr. Referred me to, but after today I am done!!!

The doctor there told me that he would give me shots to relieve the pain and after the 2nd one my pain was not relieved.  I mentioned it to the nurse and she said she would talk to the doctor and have him see me.  I have been there numerous times and had only seen the doctor my 1st initial visit.  He always came in after I was asleep and left by time I woke up,  I have called many  many times and they do not respond to my calls.  I feel that  the doctor doesn't care enough for his patients to get back with them!  There was a massage therapist that I went to inbetween visits and she was absolutely amazing!  I received a txt message saying that she had been let go.  She was the only one in that office that even cared about patients.  I do not reccommend this place what so ever!

He listens to you (which sometimes me trying to explain what hurts or how it hurts I'm not sure how he knows what I'm saying)|Started out really liking him! Then had to deal with 2 of his PA's. BOTH were seriously lacking in knowledge of my condition. Was pretty much told I had to try Lyrica if I still wanted my meds. I was adamant about NOT wanting it due to weight gain. None the less, 2 months later 20lb weight gain after losing 100 on my own and keeping it off for 6 years. After I read my Uchart notes by this PA? I was livid! Pay attention to the notes on your visit! I never ASKED for it.... The communication in the office is or was severely lacking. I was softly scolded for canceling my injections BECAUSE MY MOM WAS BEING REMOVED FROM LIFE SUPPORT! No one passed this on to him. So at my next one, he was he seemed a bit irritated on why I cancelled; this was the day after I buried her. I showed up for that one. The PA was asking me 3 months later why I was ""still depressed""?!?!? It seemed like after those PA's left, it was SCS...every appt. SCS! I will NOT do them. I wanted to try other things. I found a doctor who would, he fired me as a patient. I wish things would've went better.|What can I say! Dr. Maruti kari. Takes the time to not only hear what his patients say, but actually takes into consideration that he can't feel what you do. That everyone knows their own body best. He makes sure you can atleast get yourself up and moving and living your life. Not crippled at home by you pain/pains... Dr. Kari is caring. If I had 3 thumbs thats how many I'd give him.|Naruto Kari is incapable of treating peripheral neuropathy. My wife was in more pain after meeting him. He would not return phone calls, and left my wife high and dry without any pain management. He is a quack and an a$$hole of a human being.|Consistently waited two hours past my appointment time to see the doctor, who wouldn't even be in the room for 5 minutes. He also dismissed me from care after only attempting one type of treatment (steroid injections) which was unsuccessful. He said the only thing he could do is recommend me for a spinal cord simulator. I'm 23 years old, and he literally tried nothing else. A recommendation for a stimulator at that stage was wildly inappropriate. Meanwhile I go to an out-of-system family medicine NP who prescribed me gabapentin and my symptoms have been greatly reduced. This option was not even discussed by Dr. Kari. There's no reason that a board certified anesthesiologist wouldn't know about this option or consider it unless he was just trying to shove a patient out the door.

I was injured in school district, and faught to be able to get neck relief, since I was badly injured.  I could not even turn my head. My good friend Barb told me about him,  so after YeArS, I went.  He did a specific spinal to neck injection, and it was like- my life was totally different. I had to repeat it,and just kept getting better.
I can't thank you enough.|If I could give Justin Wikle 0 stars I would. I went in as a 19 y/o that had been dealing with moderate to severe low back pain for 3 years. After trying many rounds of physical therapy and medications, I was sent to Justin. He came into the room and immediately was confused why I was there. He would ask things like ""who referred you?"" and ""if you were at sports medicine, why would you come over here?"",  as if he didn't care to read any of the previous Doctors notes. He then proceeded to tell me, that even though the mri came back with MULTIPLE factors that were causing this pain including: 5 bulging discs, slipped vertebrae, facet anthropathy, and many many more, he concluded that I quote was "" just uncomfortable and wasn't in any real pain"". He then proceeded to say on my mychart notes that it had something to do with my history of mild anxiety that was causing me to have this pain. Then when I went in for my injection, he did not speak or say anything to me. Would rather do anything than recommend this Doctor.|Let's start at the beginning. This doctor thinks a patient who has broken 5 vertebrae in their back and has severe degenerative disc disease in their neck should take cymbalta or Lyrica. And if neither of these is a good fit, although the patient has clearly been a responsible patient and very conservative when it comes to narcotics, ie oxycodone or lortab, this doctor told me ""You better hang onto the pills you have because you're not getting anymore."" I tried to tell this doctor that people who need pain medicine might die from fentanyl because they bought it from an untrustworthy source. This doctor couldn't care less about people dying from fentanyl overdose. I asked him if I'm supposed to be in pain on a scale of 1-10 at an 8 while narcotics sit on the shelf of a pharmacy and he said ""The world is full of pain."" Wow! Sadistic bully! So I told him I'm disabled and I am asking for a reasonable accommodation according to the ADA. He said he was not going to grant a reasonable accommodation. So I told him that he has to enter the interactive process. He said he was not going to. So I informed him that I would be considering a federal civil rights lawsuit against him for disability discrimination. He smirked at me and told me we were done and opened the door for me to leave.

People are dying, committing suicide and taking fentanyl laced pills because of doctors like this man who thinks it's ok to deny pain meds for people with chronic pain that makes it impossible to work or socialize or live their lives. Pain is supposed to just be part of life and if your life is unbearable oh well too bad so sad. Some people get pain meds no problem. And others of us especially lower socio economic class just has to suffer.

We'll see what the local federal district court thinks about that. I intend to file a federal lawsuit to hold him accountable. This is not patient care. It's cookie cutter, assembly line, conveyor belt medicine. One size or drug fits all. That's corporate medicine not individualized patient care.

Dr. Elwood guided me through each step with such gentleness and professionalism, which put me at ease during a very difficult time.

Now, just one day after the injection, the difference is remarkable. The severe pain has subsided, and what remains is only mild discomfort.

Thanks, Dr. Elwood.|I was better off before I met him.
He hurt me. I have significantly more pain as a result of the test block he performed.

Generally speaking, you should take your knee pain seriously if it:

Persists for an extended period - If you have knee pain that doesn't go away after a few days or even weeks, it's a sign that you should seek medical attention.

Limits your mobility - If your knee pain makes it challenging to perform regular activities like walking or standing, you should seek medical advice.

Causes swelling or redness - If your knee appears swollen or red, it may indicate an underlying injury or inflammation.

Occurs after a traumatic event - If you experience sudden knee pain after a fall, collision, or other traumatic events, you should see a doctor as soon as possible.

Accompanied by other symptoms - If your knee pain is accompanied by other symptoms like fever, chills, or a rash, you should seek medical attention right away.",long_wait_times|pain_management_services|short_wait_times|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|good_doctors|comfortable_waiting_area|multiple_locations|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|board_certified_physicians|insurance_accepted|flexible_payment_options|cash_credit_payments_accepted|wheelchair_accessible_facility|free_parking,,,,,,,,,,ChIJOSyLDFx28ocRrpm91exhhsA,555

There have been only a couple of annoyances:
1.) two separate instances of prescriptions not being sent to the pharmacy, resulting in wasted trips to the pharmacy and time spent on the phone, trying to reach the clinicians and, ultimately, get the prescriptions sent.

2.) Surgery start time was delayed by two hours. Even though one hour was the initial estimate (upon arrival), a call/text letting us know (so as to avoid just sitting in the waiting area), would have been wonderful.

For timely service, I, unfortunately, have to recommend ignoring the automated prompts to leave a voicemail for the clinicians. Just follow the prompts for speaking with the scheduling department (to actually get through). Again, good people, just some processes that should be improved.|They have wonderful solutions here but it takes days for Dr Bell's nurse to get back to me and only if I beg her to actually correspond with me. Pharmacy always has to call multiple times for my monthly refill of a drug that isn't controlled and Dr won't put refills on it, which would help prevent this. They also do not do their proper due diligence with insurance. Tired of the victim blaming. When you and the insurance letter say it is covered and you tell me I only owe a copay what do you think I expect to pay? A copay only. You know it is impossible to fully understand an insurance plan but on your hand you know how much it will be... tell me why with insurance covering 100$ my botox costs MORE than what you said I owed without insurance!? I also keep asking for my invoice and don't get any response back... And I am noticing the unprofessional way these reviews are responded to. Please know it doesn't make the business look good to argue with patients and put their info out publicly. It's more graceful to take criticism with dignity and quietly. Screenshot is an example of the unprofessional way they reply to reviews when instead they could say NOTHING. Makes me think twice about going here now.|The front office staff and billing department are awful. They didn't bother to tell me I had to pay in advance. When I was trying to figure out how much I had on my HSA the office staff acted like I was inconveniencing them. Along with that the facilities were unclean and Dr. Ray is unprofessional. I heard her explaining to someone in the office they offshore their billing department to keep costs low. During another visit Dr Ray spent more time trying to decide what needed to be ordered for lunch than she did with me. I've never heard another Dr talk about anything other than my care. Steer clear of this place. I've called to cancel my next appointment which is a week away. I'm hoping they don't charge me a cancellation fee.|Dr Kneeman has helped my husband greatly! After multiple appointments and several Doctors that were unsuccessful, he is finally getting relief. Not only did he give him relief, he took the time to explain every step we were taking to resolve his issues. I would recommend him to everyone that has nerve pain in the neck!!!  Thanks, Dr. Kneeman!|I've been dealing with neck and shoulder pain for a year and a half.  It's gotten to the point where it has consumed my life.  Been to several doctors for this - 2 ortho doctors, physical therapist, chiropractor, psychiatrist, and a neurosurgeon.  None of them seemed to listen.  Just wanted to prescribe muscle relaxers, all to which never worked, and rush me out of the office.  Basically said it was just muscle knots and deal with it.  Hard to deal with when it consumes my life.  I started losing faith in doctors.  Seemed none of them truly cared about their patients.  Felt I was destined to live in so much pain. Then, I found Dr. Kneeman.  He takes the time to listen to your problems and trouble shoots what can be done to help alleviate the pain.  Was so impressed when he sat down next to me and took the time to explain the procedures and answer all questions.  Doesn't hurry up and rush out of the office.  When one type of treatment doesn't work, he trouble shoots other solutions.  It's so nice to finally have found a doctor that cares about his patients and wants to find a solution and won't stop until he does.|UPDATE 12/19/2024: The snappy receptionist vehemently refused to send a written confirmation that my appointment was canceled and now they're insisting I pay a ""no-show"" fee. She acted like it was going to kill her to have to send a single email or text message and now I'm getting asked to pay $25 because reception can't do their jobs properly (or even with a good attitude)?

ORIGINAL: Good practitioners, awful reception staff. Front office was snappy at me after they messed up MY appointment and booked it at the wrong place... after asking where I wanted to book the appointment. If you ask for follow-up or confirmation you'll get snapped at (and they won't do it).|I see Dr. Kneeman at the Overland Park and Lawrence locations for my challenging condition. His kindness and caring attitude is wonderful! He listens, accesses, educates, and treats to the best he can for my needs. He explains each procedure before and during, and really has great kindness for his patients. I know this service isn't easy with my situation, but we still tackle it together. He is the reason I continue with this clinic. Time is so appreciated. Attitude and effort is what we can control, and he does that well with my issues.|Dr. Dalal is my pain management specialist and she is an extraordinary doctor. She is patient, kind, and very thorough. She's been my doctor for many years and has helped me with excruciating back pain and won't give up until there is a solution for your discomfort. I highly recommend her at Kansas Pain Management.",2024-11-26|2025-01-08|2025-01-03|2025-01-27|2024-12-18|2024-09-17|2024-07-31|2024-08-28,4|2|1|5|5|1|5|5,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|1 p.m.",65.2|63.8|63.8,"Identifies as veteran-owned, Identifies as women-owned, Language assistance, Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do you accept Medicare patients?

There have been numerous complaints from both staff and patients regarding Dr. Jafri's treatment of those around him, describing his behavior as disrespectful and rude. Additionally, the clinic often experiences staffing shortages, and there are concerns about the qualifications of some staff members who may not be licensed or adequately trained for their roles.
If you are looking for a professionals Genesis Pain Clinic is not what I recommend.|Dr. Jafri and his staff have been a huge help for me.  I was able to get into see him on short notice, and he and his assistants spent a great deal of time listening to my concerns and helping me.  I am now pain free, and couldn't be any happier.  I can't recommend him highly enough. (Of note:  insurance companies no longer pay much at all for these types of services, hence, an out-of-pocket amount will be assessed prior to getting treated.  When it comes to chronic pain, every penny was worth it!) Thanks again to Dr. Jafri and his friendly staff.|PLEASE SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY HOW I WAS TREATED! I should have done more research before I went to this clinic. This is by far the most unprofessional doctors office I have been to. Dr. Jafri acts like he hates his job and gets offended if you ask him any questions. He guilt tripped me to pay everything out of pocket even though I have insurance. I paid everything out of pocket and did a couple rounds of trigger point injections (they were $350 each time and I got it done twice with no relief!) and he put me on the weight loss injection medication that was $400 a month! He had bullied me into getting the $400 medication. Little did I know I was going to end up in the ER because of it. He failed to mention that medication is for a type 2 diabetics and it helps them to maintain or lose weight because it suppresses your hunger, severely. If he would have asked me if I have ever had issues with my sugar, I would have told him yes! I have had some episodes in the past where my sugar was very low. He could have warned me to look for the signs when my sugar was getting too low. Because this medication made me so nauseous, I would go a long time without eating and he wanted me to up the dose. Unfortunately my sugar went dangerously low and I ended up in the ER on my vacation! After that incident, I cancelled everything with him. I cancelled my cervical epidural procedure because he wanted me to pay out of pocket for that, which is $1300. I told him I was going to follow up with my PCP because I was extremely sick and needed to figure things out. As far as pain goes, NO RELIEF. I spent over $2000 with his clinic and they did not help me at all. I saw my PCP and we stopped the weight loss medication because it was way to strong for someone that is hypoglycemic. I also got an MRI and it turns out I had a cervical spondylosis. I decided to get a second opinion by a different pain management. I also wanted to try out going to a chiropractor and the relief from the chiropractor has been amazing! I ended up cancelling my appointment with the new clinic. I didn't need all the trigger point injections and weight loss medication. Dr. Jafri is rude, has horrible bed side manners, and is all about money. It is truly unfortunate I didn't read the other 1 star reviews until after everything I went through with his clinic. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.|Dr. Jafri and the team at Genesis have helped me so much with chronic neck and upper back pain! They are all kind and truly want to help people in pain. We have tried multiple treatment methods which have all help reduce my pain level and helped me live an active lifestyle. I am very grateful for Dr. Jafri and his staff!|This business deserves more than 4 stars

I fly from Canada because I trust him with my care

I had a Dr treat me with ketamine in an ER and it immediately stopped my vomiting! I came to Dr Jafri interesting in finding a Dr willing to take this journey with me and give it a try. Just completed my sixth Ketamine infusion and to say it's life-changing is an understatement! It has truly helped me finally ""live my life to its fullest"" thanks to him believing in me and thinking outside the box. I am forever grateful for him and all of his incredible staff!|I recently visited the clinic for a stellate ganglion block procedure, performed by Dr. Jafri, aimed at addressing the loss of smell and taste I've been suffering from as a result of long covid. The results have been nothing short of miraculous, restoring my senses and, by extension, significantly improving my quality of life.

Dr. Jafri provided comprehensive care, taking the time to sit down with me both before and after the procedure to ensure I was fully informed about every aspect of the process. This level of patient care and communication was incredibly reassuring and greatly appreciated. I was hesitant in reaching out as this is a sensitive procedure with little information. He researched my situation and existing studies before proceeding.

I am forever grateful to Dr. Jafri and the entire clinic staff for their professionalism, expertise, and the life-changing outcome of my treatment. I almost lost my house one day because I didn't even smell a burning toaster next to me.

Their dedication to patient well-being has made a profound difference in my life, and I cannot recommend them highly enough.

If anyone has questions, I would be happy to answer them. I hope and pray that studies to discover damage from long covid continues.|Dr Jafri is very good about managing my pain and I have been able to decrease my pain medication tremendously.

Said he didn't know how to proceed, even though both my doctor and my physical therapist said an MRI was the next step.

Was told by rude/arrogant scheduler Tim to ""get in line with everyone else"". This type of timeframe was drastically different than what was told at my initial consultation.
""Pain Management"" and two month lead time on appointments do not go together. Patient needs and care are clearly not a priority within the culture of the office.

Some people are put off by the contract don't drink, don't use drugs, make sure u have the correct number of meds by the next months appointment.  It isn't hard if u want to be helped. Be honest with yourself an them an it all works out.
I definitely recommend this facility an the providers. Alex and Bonnie are wonderful.|Had a cervical steroid ESI yesterday and the process went so smoothly. Dr. Parks took his time, was caring, and walked me through the entire process as it was happening. The staff was awesome, a 10/10. I never once felt rushed or that I was just another number. If you are looking to be treated as a person and not just another insurance claim, this is the office for you.|I see Dr. Mindy.  She's awesome!!  I have also had steroidal injections administered by Dr. Parks with great results!  Excellent staff & excellent service!  I never have to wait more than 5 mins to see my doc. Highly recommend!|I am on the fence. The PA I was seeing retired, Dr. Parks is very good at what he does and deserves that credit. Front office staff has always been kind, Jennifer has been helpful for sure in another area of the office. Scheduling...uh not so much with their response to your questions. Rec'd a call today that was unexpected but I am so glad they called HOWEVER,   Scheduler: calling to get you scheduled for *** injection. I said: Oh, so my insurance approved the procedure? Scheduler: well that is why we are calling.  hmm, legit question for me, last visit was ""scheduling for injection and it turned out to be just a consult when I came to the appt, was not what I understood it to be, I was sooo upset so this question was legit and definitely did not warrant some response like that but that is usually what I get from scheduling.  I am thankful for them getting me scheduled but the past responses have been what I would deem inappropriate for that position and kind of rude and some were a little evasive. As a patient, there are those questions that we are going to ask, especially if we have not gotten clear answers prior or have had problems with prior authorizations in the past, I feel the appropriate answer would of been YES, your insurance approved to procedure for ***** on this date **/**/2024.  How hard is that?  Just a suggestion, patients being called and schedule deal with alot more then some ppl have had to deal with themselves, try to be kind and understanding and just clearly answer our questions.  This steers patients away and effects the office as a whole and brings questions to light when we come there and do we trust? What else do we need to worry about. Step into our shoes for a minute.|My husband went here and they claimed he tested positive for alcohol ( which by the way isn't illegal) but apparently when you sign a contract with them, you can't drink, too controlling and very rude, and they cancel your contract and leave you hang out to dry|WARNING!! Please take caution before Epidural Steroid Injections!! This review is not personal towards any doctors or medical staff here, it's simply what happened to me, meaning it can happen to you too! In short summary, after participating in eight weeks of physical therapy sessions, I was told from professional medical staff that physical therapy didn't work for me and I should consider getting epidural steroid injections to alleviate my pain.  As a consequence to having these injections, I suffered excruciating pain that required ER visits, an enormous amount of pain medication, loss of physical independence and severe depression/anxiety.  I have spent over a year visiting medical specialists, and participating in quality physical therapy(s) recovering from my body rejecting to injections in my L4, L5, and S1 just to achieve pre-injection status. My story is too long for a review. Please read my other medical oriented reviews to receive a glimpse of other therapies and specialists I've had to rely on during this long pain journey to recover from my choice to have epidural steroid injections.  I'm wishing you the best of luck on your pain journey!!|I have been going to this office for several years. They have been very sympathetic to my pain issues. They have tried many different things to get me the best care. I have no problems being seen quickly. Mindy is great and discusses what works and what doesn't.  Dr. Parks has always been kind and professional.

The front desk ladies were awesome and helpful since we had some issues with the patient portal. The gentleman I met with today was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, for first time in over a decade I actually felt like a medical professional LISTENED to me!! I teared up because he spent so much time with me and didn't brush off my concerns, he treated me like a fellow human being that was just in a lot of pain, not like a number on a chart to be billed for insurance. He didn't rush me, he understood my pain and is committed to finding the actual root of the problem and not just sticking me with needles to mask the symptoms. He saw the pain in my face, he saw how tired I am of being ignored and brushed off by other medical professionals... for first time in years I felt SEEN and HEARD!

My husband was in waiting room waiting for me, as I walked out I looked at him with tears in my eyes and just said ""that man is a damn Unicorn!!"" I actually cried on the way home because I have not seen a doctor who actually cared so much in so long. This doctor has actually given me hope, something I gave up on a long time ago when it comes to medical issues. This doctor has seriously saved my life, I had all but given up any hope of finding a medical professional that would take me seriously and not dismiss me, I was not far off from just giving up completely on even trying to get medical care. Thank you Dr. Dean.... Thank you for giving me hope, for seeing me and my pain, for being willing to tackle the challenges with my back and medical issues...|If I could give them a million stars I would. They are all like family now. Been going to them for my lower back and sciatica for years! I have long intervals when I don't need treatments at all. Highly recommend getting care here!|Loved Scott and his professionalism, kindness and determination to help his patients. With that being said, the gate keeper office staff are the exact opposite. Rude and lazy as in not doing their work as far as insurance authorization for payment. Easier for them just to bill the patient. Sorry Scott I wont be back. You need to get rid of some people in the insurance department  of your business.|I have had nothing but the BEST experience here at the Flint Hills Pain Management. I have had ongoing chronic back pain since a hospital visit in June. After trying everything and seeing every doctor within 2 hours of me I came here. Scott is amazing and is fantastic at talking through everything with me and staying so positive through the whole process. The Ladies at the desk are beyond professional and don't miss a beat. Every visit has been worth the 1 1/2 drive. I am so glad I got referral for this specific office. Couldn't be happier!|Have been getting treatment for several years for low back arthritis.

Almost like I am at a friend's office. He genuinely wants his patients to be as pain free as possible but he gives you all tue information up front and never pressures me. I have to keep getting the ablations done for a few years and I will continue coming here!|Dr. Kyle had up and leave due to better job opportunities. I really do love the new doctor there. HOWEVER, it is nearly impossible to get seen, because he bounces between clinics, not his fault, but the new receptionist is down right rude. She's the older woman. She lacks customer service completely, she speaks to customers rude, looks at customers rude and treats military members like they are dirt. She is unable to keep up with the work flow there, says she has called me several times in which I have never received a phone call from her, her response is maybe you should keep up on your referrals.

He is professional and kind and his assistant during the procedure is also a pleasure. He convinced me to pay over $14000 out of pocket for stem cell surgery in 2022 that sounded very promising for a long term solution. After being rescheduled a couple times, one reason being him catching Covid, I decided to hold off on the procedure. I was refunded my deposit with no problem. Fast forward to May 2023 my pain became unbearable and I asked my primary doctor for a referral to see him again. When I went to schedule the woman at the front desk was very rude and told me I had a balance. I paid it on the spot with no problem. It was only $140.00. Keep in mind after every appointment I attempted to pay my copay and would be told nothing was due. My mother even attempted to pay one time during one of my procedures and was told the same.
Anything I said to this woman was met with rudeness and arguing for no reason. She told me I missed an injection in Oct 2022. This would have been AFTER the scheduled Stem Cell surgery and unnecessary. The appointment should have never been scheduled. The Dr told me in July 2022, I couldn't have anymore injections until after Oct because my body needed a break. I never scheduled the Oct appointment because the stem surgery was scheduled for September.
I ended up getting scheduled for June 13 2023 for a follow up. I put it in my calendar for July 13 instead. Totally my fault the appointment was missed. But maybe if that woman wasn't so nasty during our interaction I may not have made that mistake. I left that interaction in tears and went to Lab Corp across the parking lot to complete some required labs.  One of the staff members said they had also been mistreated by this woman and had numerous patients come in with the same complaints . The other staff member said she had positive experiences with the clinic but had also heard numerous complaints. I called today to reschedule and was told I couldn't be seen.|Dr Peloquin has been my pain manager for at least 15 years or more.  I suffered from chronic severe pain due to an auto accident when I was 15 year old and a 20 foot fall about 25 years ago that dislocated my left SI joint. After it was corrected, the joint was hyper mobile so had three titainian implants inserted through the joint which helped with stabilization but they broke loose so was back in pain again.  After stem cell therapy, in both the SI joints and my degenerative/bulging discs in my upper back, I can drive to KC (2 1/2 hours) without sitting on a pillow or stopping to exercise.  I am 77 years old now, still live on my 400 acre farm, burn firewood for heat, clearing brush out of fence rows, repairing fence and cutting down nuisance trees to the extent the tree lovers are yelling at me.  I blame it all on Dr Peloquin.|Dr Peliquin and staff are very helpful and goes beyond the call of duty to make sure you are comfortable and taken care of.

I have been with this pain care clinic since April 2024 coming from out of state Peachtree City, GA. Dr. Jenny Chandra reviewed the last six months of my complex spine injuries and the care I received in Georgia from my previous pain management Dr. She quickly accessed made changes in my treatment plan and I have my chronic pain under control. I now am seeing PRN Dorsey Paul who listens and is very responsive to questions and needs for the care provided.
I have had nothing but positive experiences from this clinic and would recommend it. If however, you are looking for a client to prescribe you opiates? This is not the clinic for you unless you have a documented history.  What this clinic will do like most clinics in the area, they will review your case, radiology and offer their recommendations and treatment plans tailored to your specific medical conditions.|I would Recommend to everyone Dr Ted Williams MD, his Nurse & Staff!

Dr Williams has a Genuine interest in Me, achieving and maintaining good Health & that is hard to fine!|Dr. Chandra is an AMAZING Physician !! She has Always been on of the Most Intelligent Doctors I know...She is Amazing !|Dr. Chandra recommends Lifewave X39, which is a product shilled by a pyramid scheme. It doesn't work, fyi. Really cruel to get patients hopes up. I also don't appreciate leaving a message for Dr. Chandra/her nurse and instead Mary Jane the scheduler calls me back about it? What kind of privacy is that? Did she even relay my message??|Waited over 2 hours for my 1st appointment should have known then this wasn't the office for me. PJ was rude and unprofessional with me she started laughing at me while I was crying! Instead of this provider giving me a warning they just dismissed me in such a rude manor. Office doesn't return phone calls called in on a Thursday and never got a call back until Monday when I had to call several times! They never once apologized for not returning the call. I recently had surgery and they seem not to care. Please stay far away from this place go to KS Pain Management instead do not go here..|Mid America Pain Clinic has always helped me in different ways. I started seeing the owner, Dr Chandra about 8 or 9 years ago. She's very helpful when it comes to any type of pain and doesn't just throw meds at you. There's also a new Dr there who's a functional medicine doctor, and he is truly amazing. Dr Williams. He has done tests that no other doctor I've been to has probably ever heard of. He says functional medicine is his calling. I have EDS, ME/CFS, POTS, and have had 28 surgeries to date. Dr Williams is digging deep to help me with my
ME/CFS, bc I've spent the last 5 yrs in bed - ever since I got Covid in January 2020. I highly recommend this office for chronic pain, and any unusual health issues that other doctors may not be able to help with. There are several doctors there and a PA & nurse practitioners as well. Sometimes you can wait for longer than expected, but it's only bc they all want to cover all their bases with your health.|I have been with Mid America Poly Clinic for several years.  My Dr listens to me, doesn't put me down,  and has tons of compassion. Some visits I go in crying, other visits cranky cause I hurt, and she's always understanding.  Yes, the new guidelines make u feel like a criminal, but that's not the clinics fault.  They are following State guidelines.  I highly recommend this clinic and can't thank Dr. Chandra enough for the treatment plan I'm under.|Don't like the fact that you don't see the same doctor for your appointments.",2024-11-21|2025-02-18|2025-02-12|2024-08-04|2024-04-04|2024-04-25|2021-02-07|2025-01-11,5|5|5|1|1|5|5|3,,,"2 p.m.|1 p.m.|10 a.m.",72|70.25|69.75,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","And the 3 back Surgeries I've already had within the past 6-7 years have done nothing but make matters worse.

My back is still doing much better and I'm sure I'll be back in another 5 years.|LOVE Dr. Wheeler and his staff, they are all outstanding!! They truly care about each patient and make you feel like family. They take time to listen and make sure you're taken care of no matter what. I've been going to Dr. Wheeler for almost 6 years and I wish I could clone him for every Doctor I see.

I thank God for the man that Sean Wheeler is and how fortunate his patients are that receive his care. I pray God continues to bless Sean and his family.|I only visited Dr Wheeler once and he wrote an order for PT emphasizing breathing, posture and stabilization for my lower back pain.  I wanted to have PT at his office but my insurance didn't cover it.  But, I found a physical therapist, Kelly Bukaty at Overland Park Regional hospital, that fully understood what Dr Wheeler was recommending.  I had 15 sessions with Kelly and the PT helped a lot.  My last PT was 3/26/24.  I can do my long walks and yard work and hunting and fishing without much pain and I learned how to manage the pain when it occurs.  I still have bad pain when I get up in the morning but that goes away quickly once I get moving.  The morning pain is probably caused by a structural problem (6mm anterolisthesis at L4-L5) in my spine.  Kelly gave me several PT exercises for breathing, stretching and core stabilization.  It took awhile to improve due to my bad habits for breathing and lifting.  I am very happy with the results of my PT and I continue to do the exercises.
Thank you Dr Wheeler for providing the proper PT orders and thanks to Kelly for following them correctly.

We didn't even know there was an option for questions on here, so we apologize for not responding. 

Pain is hard. Having pain every day takes a toll on a person. A toll physically, mentally, financially, with relationships, with jobs, with activities. It also affects people spiritually. We can't always get people better, but we try. We also try to see the whole person and care for that whole person. A prayer is not something we do for everybody and it is not forced on anyone. It is an extension of the care that we feel and want to give. It is a realization that the people we treat are more than just patients. They are a whole person with many, many parts that make up that whole.

They waited until 1 day before the appt to let me know they didn't take my insurance.

Both have been the very best that I have ever experienced in their field. Together through their help and treatment they have changed my life for the better.

I am so happy to have them as my Doctors. They both are extremely caring and professional in their treatment, and care for others.|I have seen Laura Textor, pain management nurse,  for peripheral nerve pain for many years now.  She is compassionate, knowledgeable and available whenever I need to get  in to see her.  Dr William Rosenberg performed my needed back fusion surgery several years ago with great results. I can't imagine going anywhere else and have referred many people to them.|The greeting at the desk by Carmelita was wonderful. We had already shared a laugh by phone when I was setting up my appointment.
I found everyone so kind and encouraging when I entered and as I was being processed as a patient to meet Dr Rosenberg. He talked with me openly and also made me feel more encouraged than I had been in the years I have been struggling with this pain after seeing other doctors and therapists.
My Myelogram is scheduled for April and I am hopeful there will be a plan of action to address my pain and make life easier. I have become more and more limited in my movements, and there are just too many places to visit to give up now.
Thank you all,
Claudia Black|I have had the opportunity to use the Center for Relief of Pain two times in the past two years.  First I had back surgery which was extremely successful but l still had.pain in my right leg.  I returned and was recommended that I try a nerve stimulator.  The trial of this device was unbelievable successful and I am now scheduled for the permanent device.
Over the years my wife and I have been to many medical practices and have never found one more professional, competent and friendly!
I have recommended this practice to several friends and they had similar experiences. I will continue to recommend them to anyone that need their services.|The nurse practitioner experienced in the spine and nervous system, was very thorough and gave me hope that something will be done to relieve my numbness, tingling and pain! This is my second time with Laura Textor and Dr. WM Rosenberg. He did a fusion of my cervical vertebrae in 2020 and I never had a problem until now! I am counting on them to get to the bottom of this problem, as well, with hopefully the promptness and accuracy with their knowledge, and experience, as before!

We have not!  My husband had a procedure, Dr Scott told him to call the next day if he was in pain.  My husband called the next morning and had to leave a message, that was a Tuesday.  No response.  He was still in pain and I left a message on Wednesday again no response.  My husband's family doctor called in for something to help with his pain.  On Friday, my husband left another message. NO RESPONSE!
Four weeks later my husband dropped paperwork at their office and the receptionist told him to call the office manager, Megan, so he called and left a message. AGAIN NO RESPONSE.
Almost 2 months later and we have still not received a call back.
We received a letter saying they had been trying to call.  Not true!  His phone number has not changed and he has left his phone number each time he left a message as well.   Today we called in response to the  letter.  You ALWAYS have to leave a message.  Am sure we will not hear back.  My husband likes Dr Scott but this is unacceptable!   We will be finding another place that cares!!!|It was my first time being treated by Dr. Jared Scott. However, it was not my first time receiving thoracic epidural treatments. I had received 5 other treatments by another Wichita doctor. I will say that this is the absolute best experience I have had thus far. During my time with Dr. Scott I never needed cold towels to ease my experience or pain. He completely walked me through the process as he was conducting the treatment with constant updates on when it would be completed and I felt little to no pain during the process.
The nurse staff he has surrounding him are absolute 5 star athletes in the game of medicine. They knew the process incredibly well and provided Dr. Scott with what was needed before he even had to ask. He is extremely lucky to have that support staff by his side.

To all of you at the Kansas Spine and Specialty Hospital I want to THANK YOU for all your efforts in ensuring things went well and ensuring I had a good experience. I'll see you in a few months!|Dr. Scott and Rhonda are 2 of the most caring people i know! Over the years they have helped me with my severe chronic pain. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone who has chronic pain.|I don't recommend Dr. Jared Scott. In 2019 I almost died due to a surgical incision he performed. I've never spoken publicly about my experience till now due to the horrors I've had to deal with since. All I'm saying is really evaluate before you choose this provider.|I've had a few intercostal injections by Dr Ain. The communication between his PA at the time and Dr Ain was terrible. When I was sent to Dr Scott I thought we would have the same situation - seeing Dr Scotts PA (Rhonda) and then getting the injection by Dr Scott. I was fully expecting Dr Scott to not know what was happening when I showed up for the injection.

Not the case. Even though I saw Rhonda and not Dr Scott it was clear that they were communicating very well. When I went for the injection Dr Scott had full understanding and command of my history and I had complete confidence that I was getting good quality care.

Ultimately the therapy failed. This happens sometimes for a lot of reasons out of the Dr's control. With that said I would not hesitate to return to Dr Scott for treatment in the future.|I absolutely love Dr Scott and his nurse practitioner Rhonda! They are two of the most knowledgeable people I have come into contact with while trying to deal with my pain. They are kind as well and have never made me feel like just another patient, they take the time to listen to what I tell them I am feeling and they talk to me on a personal level even sharing their personal life stories with me. I am so thankful for them and the work they do!|I am the wife of a patient for Dr Scott. The only reason I rated him 2 stars is because he is very nice. As far as professionalism and caring about the patients I would rate him 0!!! We had been waiting 6 weeks on them to call and set up an appt, and that was after my husband had gotten out of the hospital. He has many health issues, which Dr Scott knew of all along! And he had told my husband he didn't have any problems giving him pain pills. My husband probably has 1 to 3 years left to live, and he just kept telling him that his PA is the one to prescribe those, that he doesn't. And he calls himself a pain management Dr?!?!??? Finally yesterday they called my husband and told him he needed to go somewhere else. That he was too much of a liability!!!! Really?!?!???! After wasting all this time, now we have to start over again!!!!! Such a joke!!!!!! Most people that need pain pills can't waste 6 weeks just for him to be turned down!!!!!

Janelle, my case manager, spent a good time with me trying to figure out my pain and has worked up a program that is fitting to my recovery needs.  I was really impressed with how detailed she was setting up this plan. She still checks in on my current condition when she catches me in passing, which is nice to see.  Doctor Brian is always interested in my current condition as well and shows that he is here to help.  My last chiropractor could not get my neck to adjust like he has been able too.  The first time he adjusted my neck, I was in complete shock of what I heard and felt.  After adjustments are made I always feel like I just grew a couple inches!!!!   Lisa has really helped with the muscular pain as well by giving me injections in my pain areas!   I hate needles but she does a great job!  Her experience and attention to detail shined when she was examining me when she noticed muscle spasms in my shoulder during certain movements as I was not aware these spasms were even happening but impressed when she showed me!  I have not received the full experience in rehab yet, due to my scheduling, but so far the neck decompression machine is doing well and the rehab technicians are great people to work with.  After 4 visits I was already able to sleep comfortably in my bed.  I realize I still have more work to do.  But I'm confident this team will get me there.

The clinic structure is very welcoming and gives you that rustic country feeling.  But all in all this clinic is a gem out here in the country.  The staff all work as a team or better yet more like a family.  Oh and I can't forget the biggest sweat heart of all, Stella the clinic dog!!!

******************

Update!   I've completed my recovery journey!   I can't believe I went so long in pain.  I am a stubborn person and I need to get over that!  Dr. Brian and his staff of awesome ladies have got me feeling like I'm younger again.  I got my life back on track with zero pain.

Thank you Dr. Brian for the adjustments, our talks and creating this place with your team, Lisa for all the trigger point injections and creating my recovery with Janelle, Julie for your words of wisdom, Hannah for your support, and thank you to the most awesome rehab ladies Jill and Katie for all the laughs, support, teachings, and putting up with me!

We'd been through different ENT's, smell therapy's and steroid treatments with no support for her parosmia. Today we drove 2+ hours from Kansas City to Marion for what we thought was going to be her last chance at a normal life with a Stellate Ganglion Block procedure. It was amazing! The St Lukes staff and HPM staff were all incredible. They could tell our daughter was nervous and did everything they could to make the uncomfortable procedure bearable for her and we saw IMMEDIATE results. After the procedure she had her first hamburger in 2 years and for dinner had two plates of what used to be her favorite italian pasta and garlic bread.
The different KC based Pain centers who do SGB wouldn't even talk to me because of the age of my daughter and the fact this was for long term covid and not 'pain treatment'.

Hats off to Dr. Eubanks by being the best doctor  on my care team.  He has tried to help get me pain free for the shortest amount of time.  However the most kindest through a difficult process.

Dr. Eubanks has the kindest eyes  and when he walks in the room, he smiles and puts you at ease!  He finds out who the support team is with you then goes into how he can try to help you.

I wished he was a PCP just so I could go back to see him and his team!  From the front desk to the back desk, everyone is kind, understanding, and patient.....since I shuffle in a slow pace 

I appreciate that when you have a bill, they aren't badgering you or stressing you out when you arrive.  They simply mail another bill.  When I'm already stressed due to pain, that's the last thing I want to deal with coming in.   Thanks you Pain Care for taking that into consideration...if you do.

The location is right off the highway so you don't have to shuffle through Metcalf traffic.  . The chairs are recliners so the driver waiting for you can sleep  in comfort 

Dr. Eubanks will walk you through the options he can offer until it's dwindled down to the very last.  If you're in search for an excellent office all the way around, this, is a hit!!!|I had a procedure and paid the bill way ahead of time. Months later I received a letter stating that my insurance accidentally used the wrong code and I may owe more money for the procedure. I reached out to their office to see if this was true and they said it was and that they would get me connected with someone in billing to set up a payment plan. No one from billing contacted me, nor did I receive an official new bill. I did receive a collections letter on my Birthday.|Dr. Eubanks saved my life. Seriously. I am early 30s. I haven't known anything other than pain down my entire spine and into my left leg. I have flinched every time someone touches my shoulders/neck, and spine over the last 15 years.
I feel like a completely different person with no anger of being in pain anymore.

I've spent thousands of dollars with chiro adjustments, massages, PT - and got recommended to Dr Eubanks by a friend to do steroid injections.
The entire office staff is so very kind, and will spend time on the phone answering any sort of questions or concerns.
I have had 4 visits - and had immediate results within 1-2 days after. Each visit being a different location for injections.
Thank you PainCare staff and Dr Eubanks for being so kind, caring, and understanding about pain.|I have been treated by both Dr Eubanks but 99% by Dr. Bruning. I'm a dentist and I have complete confidence in both of these guys. 8 years as a patient now and they are the best and are specialists! Same day out of pain every time I throw out my back bending over seeing my own patients.|Dr Eubanks has been so patient and diligent in identifying and treating my pain. He was not my first pain specialist but he definitely  will be who I trust and recommend! Bravo!|I had a 65% tear in my supraspinatus tendon. (Rotator cuff) I was told by an orthopedic that PRP probably would not be the answer I was encouraged by a chiropractor to see Dr. Eubanks. It's been almost a year. I was diligent in  physical therapy the first four months followed by my own weight training techniques. I have to say this was the best choice I could've ever made. My shoulder has gradually gone from 50% to 60% to 70% I would have to say it's at 90% now I've had no pain in the past 10 months. Surgery was the main option, PRP was the real answer. Dr. Eubanks was phenomenal! Eric in physical therapy was equally as great. He was very creative and giving me exercises that I could take home and always changed up each appointment with a new drill. It will be a year next month.  I wanted to wait before I made a report, to see if it was really going to work. Patience is the key! I would have to say I'm back to normal shoulder use! I'm grateful this pain  center offers alternative treatments for tendon tears.|This is what happened to me.

These doctors are only interested in making money off their patients injuries and pain.  Dr Eubanks and his associate, gave me 7 epidural injections in 1 year.  My thyroid and adrenal glands were damaged.  I suffered from weak bones, and most importantly, I lost my mind over those excess injections.  He should have handed me off to Dr Hess immediately, and did not.

I did not have chronic pain until a series of events from my late 40's to my current age of 60. But one incident by one I developed excruciating pain on a daily basis. Did the Lemons Center fix my pain?  No. It taught me how to manage it. It made me understand I'm not alone. It gave me confidence and hope for the future. I 100% recommend the program to anyone who is a chronic pain patient.|The Lemon Center Pain Management program was fantastic! So many life skills that I wish I had learned when I was young. Proper breathing, stress management, daily moderate exercise, and the list goes on. I went from needing Lidocaine patches every day to not needing them at all in just the 30 days of the program.|After sustaining a life-changing injury, The Lemon's Center helped me to learn how to deal with chronic back and hip pain. I still use the biofeedback and tai-chi techniques I learned there daily. If you would like to manage your chronic pain without using opioids or prescription medications, I strongly recommend reaching out to them. They are truly dedicated to helping people and, in my experience, worked within my budget to provide me with the assistance I needed to live my life under these new circumstances.|I went to Dr. Lemons around 8 years ago. It was the best experience i had with my pain management. I have been experiencing severe chronic pain for 17 years after a car wreck. I have practice my new found cognitive way of managing my pain for 17 years. It helps!! I recomend everyone i know to The Lemons Center. One thing i will say because i had to experience myself. If you think the 6 week course is unpractal the u havent hit rock bottom with your pain. I went to 45 doctors and the Mayo Clinic. They said yes you have pain and we dont know why. Dr. Lemons was my last resort.....and it worked. I have reduced my meds by 3/4. Im telling you this program works. Thanks Jim for the ability to have something the rest of my life i can use to MANAGE my pain and not fight it. Best pain management in the city.|The Lemons Center is not a magic pill. It's a more nuanced and comprehensive source of help that examines the science between cause and effect and how our pain is exacerbated by personal behaviors and physical limitations that sometimes go unseen. What we don't know always has the potential to hurt us.

Lemons makes attempts to put the knowledge of our pain management into an understandable framework so that we know more and are in a better position to take responsibility for a healthier life. Such thinking is sorely needed in this world and by those who need relief in understanding what pain is and what makes it worse. The Lemons Center is helpful to those who are trying to find ways to understand and manage the source of their pain. It's not going to get rid of the pain but it will help you in facilitating a healthier life and a healthier way of relating to pain, which can be a very personal process. It doesn't stop or end there.

The methodology and wisdom of Lemons is in mitigating stress response and implementing personal awareness of where the touch points between pain and stress intersect so that we can take back our lives. It is in promoting that awareness of how we move and how we think and how that process can help or hinder recovery that determines whether there is success in pain management. I found my time in the program to be very elucidating. I still hurt a lot but I know myself better and know that there are others like me and that I'm not alone.

As for personnel, everyone was incredibly helpful, patient and there is light and love there.  It's a good atmosphere for learning and changing bad habits and learning good ones.  After years in pain it's hard to trust that it's going to get better.  Jim Lemons is an incredibly wise guy, in just about every way.  (sorry Jim I couldn't resist)

A few last words, those expecting to go in and be magically cured of chronic pain are going to be very disappointed. Those that go in with realistic expectations of pain management and how to best help yourself will be greeted by a kindly crew of helpers and health facilitators who will do their best to help you be successful. If you go in with an open mind you will leave with a bit more peace. You will leave with knowledge and techniques that will serve you well for the rest of your life.  It will get better.|Words can not express the respect I have and hold for Dr. Jim Lemons and his fantastic staff. Dr. Lemons's dedication to helping you by listening and teaching you thru your own experiences is surreal. I was making a terrible chronic condition worse by feeding the fuel that took over my life and I had no idea. Unfortunately, chronic pain will never go away, but it will ALSO never take over my life again.
The program he created while working at the Mayo Clinic is practiced all over. This program is Hands down the Best kept secret in town.|I wish someone would have told me about Behavioral Pain Management long ago. No, it's not a cure but has helped me tremendously in learning how to live with chronic pain. Dr. Lemons and staff are kind and compassion and have given me tools to manage my pain.|Wonderful, professional staff and Dr. Lemons goes above and beyond to make sure you know what's available for you and your circumstance. I can't thank them enough for everything they did.

They are compassionate, understanding, and truly dedicated to patient care. Dr. Scott, in particular, is polite, considerate, personable, an excellent communicator, and an outstanding physician.

While scheduling appointments can be challenging due to his popularity, it is a testament to the exceptional care he provides. The only difficulties I have encountered have been occasional miscommunications with the office staff, likely due to the high turnover rate in such a busy clinic.

Despite this, I am extremely happy with the care I receive and will continue to trust Dr. Scott and his team with my healthcare for the foreseeable future.|My first appt was Aug 15th I saw one of Dr Scott's PAs she was great went over everything and convinced me to try another neck injection even though the previous one I had at another office made my pain worse. I went in yesterday on my birthday 11/21 for said neck injection. What I was told in the first at is I'd have a consult first with the Dr Scott then the injection procedure. That did not happen I have still never even seen Dr Scott's face and he had needles in my spine. The nursing staff took me back rudely told me to lay face down on the table didn't give me anytime to adjust comfortable before rudely say my face needed to be in the whole so I was laying uncomfortable the entire time. Then multiple people proceeded to talk around me and touch me repeatedly without asking or warning me first. They used tape to stretch out my shirt instead of offering a sterile gown. They only asked me one question my weight. The Dr came in after probably 15mins of me laying uncomfortable, in pain, and ignored like I wasn't in the room. Dr Scott was fine but I was already so upset and just wanted it done so I could go. After I got up grabbed my stuff told the nurses how rude they were and the entire experience was awful. They didn't look like they cared at all.

I received a call later to go over the after paperwork because I left without it and voiced my concerns again which again didn't seem like that nurse cared either and was blowing it off. I left feeling like I wasn't human to them just a task on their list.|I had the first phase of an RFA, before I had it I asked if they were sure I need prior authorization for my procedure for all phases with my insurance as I did NOT with any of my ESIs. The response was ""we have never heard of that."" So I had step one have been waiting almost 4 weeks for them to call me to schedule step 2. Called Friday left a message and decided I would just check with our insurance to see where we were at. They informed me with my diagnosis code I did NOT need ANY prior authorization for a RFA procedure. So why am I waiting all this time to wait for authorization that I don't need that they should of know the first time they contacted our insurance company when the Dr told me we only needed to wait 2 weeks in between procedures? And is is really necessary to do 2 ""tests"" to see if it's going to help that they told me were required by insurance when my insurance specifically told me I do not any type of prior authorization?? I understand doing one to make sure it's of benefit but 2??? I left 2 messages with my Drs person they said handles these things and my husband left 2 with the office manager. Neither of us received a return call. So disappointing as I really like my Dr and don't want to see anyone else but this is a very poorly ran clinic on the business side. Its almost like we are being punished for having good insurance.|Please find another doctor's office for your back and pain management!
From the very beginning, I had to follow up several times just to get an appointment.
After visiting with the nurse who saw me, we would determined we needed imaging. I waited two weeks to get a call back to schedule the imaging and no one ever called. Finally, I called and got it scheduled. The imaging ended up taking 2 hours. Most of that's time was spent waiting in the waiting room or in a gown for an imaging professional to show up and do the imaging.
After the imaging was finished, I waited another 10 days hoping to get a call back but never did. I called the office again.  This time I asked the nurses assistant if they had a procedure in place for calling people back after imaging is completed and she clearly said they did not. I don't understand how an office can function that way.
At this point I indicated to them that I would be finding another doctor's office, but would like to pick up a copy of my imaging for the other office. Later that day I received a call indicating that the doctor would like to do an injection. I decided to give them one more chance.
The day of the injection I was not informed of any side effects or risks involved, nor the amount of pain that would be involved in receiving the injection.  My pain is now worse than when I started.
At my follow-up visit, the nurse did not show up for 30 minutes after my appointment time. At this point I decided to walk away.  Very little, if anything, about my experience with this office has felt like health care.|I can't get anyone to help me after I had the stimulator implanted.  I called and they said I can't be seen even though my insurance paid most of this and I have paid payment every month for a couple of years. The wires moved I guess, I also know the temporary was amazing however the permanent is just no where near as good. In the beginning Dr. Scott and Rhonda were very helpful and attentive, however now I can't get any help! Maybe making this post will help! This is my body that you all put a device in, and now you will not help me! This is wrong very wrong!
I'm having issues with the devices and can't seem to get a call back to help me with them.  While in the beginning  Dr. Scott and Rhonda was very nice and helpful I just can not get help now..maybe a post will get me some!|Dr Ain and APRN Sarah have been great  They have been very helpful in helping me with my back problems and pain. The office staff has been very patient and kind.|Would give zero stars if I could. Office staff was rude. Was referred by my Dr. and it turned out because I was in an accident and sued they would not take me on as a PT. I have dual insurance and pay a lot of money for health insurance. This place had me in tears and very discourage of getting any kind of help for my back. I would recommend not wasting your time or money making an appt at this place.|Absolutely the most unorganized, unprofessional medical facility I have ever dealt with.

Dr. Nguyen has ZERO bedside manner and is extremely condescending. He will not allow you to speak, or ask questions. He is VERY rude and hateful with his patients. Or, maybe that's only on the work comp side of things, which is all I have experience with. If you're on work comp, and you're looking for a provider that is compassionate and caring, find someplace else to go.|After waiting over a month for this place to deny my referral because my condition is not severe enough I am furious. I was already approved by another pain management clinic but they did not take my insurance so I got referred to ICT. Every time I called to check on my referral the receptionists were rude and short. I would not trust this place to take care of your pain and needs!|Don't waste your time with this place. They wasted weeks of my time claiming they couldn't take my file without more records. Then when they got the records showing my extensive disease spread, they kept telling the doctors they were looking at it and would call back.

They said the doctor had information in hand on October 8th and would call with a decision. Today, October 14th the primary advised me to try calling them. I did and suddenly they have an answer but it was so strange. They never called to give it to my doctors like they claimed.

They claimed the CDC doesn't recommend any of their treatments for my diagnosis? My diagnosis is rare and affects many organs. There's no one size fits all recommendation for it and any current treatment standards are definitely not coming from the CDC for such a rare disorder.

She kept repeating this rehearsed phrase like a robot. Very odd. Like I was a frequent caller or something. This was the first time I've ever called them. The phrase she said didn't really make sense. So I asked her to explain. She repeated it slower and louder. Like I was mentally challenged and hard of hearing. I said ""no I don't need you to repeat it. I heard what you said. It doesn't make any sense no matter how loud or slow you say it."" She gave super vague answers that were basically ""we aren't capable of helping"" or ""we simply don't want to because this case would require actual work.""

So yeah if you want to have them waste your time and give some nonsense unprofessional answer like that after months of runaround. Then sure call them. Maybe if you have something common like pawpaw's arthritis this place could work for you. Otherwise I would heed the other warnings and avoid this unprofessional place.|I take my mother here for pain management. The facility is very clean and comfortable. The staff at the front desk is extremely friendly and helpful. The providers are knowledgeable and have excellent bedside manner!|The doctors aren't interested in helping people. Just controlling you. I went in for a consultation and the doctor wouldn't even listen to me.|Dr Nguyen and the other providers are always prompt and fast. Good thing is you're never waiting. Bad thing is that they have a very set routine for what they do when they come in and they don't like it to be disrupted. Which I recently did by asking questions about my pain pump and suggesting that my liver pain, if my issues couldn't be fixed by liver Dr, would be chronic pain and could we adjust things to accommodate this? My provider responded by getting upset telling me to go to another one of the providers there or find somewhere else to go. Then she got up and left the room, slamming the door on her way out. After discussing what had gone on with the nurse she spoke with Teather, Dr Nguyen's nurse (also one of the 5 star reviews), who spoke with me before I left. Teather told me she'd get me in to see Dr Nguyen. Teather later said she called me with an appointment time and left VM on my phone but I never received a message on my phone. Due to my brain injuries I have memory issues so I save my messages. I've not had any from her. When I didn't hear from her I decided to look elsewhere. I had already been considering it anyway because of how far away they are from me now. I now live out in Augusta area and they are way on west side of town. But I never hid that I was looking at other Drs. I was always upfront about it. And I never took any medicine from another Dr. But I'd have had to go to 2 different Drs for the regiment I was on. So I decided to stay with Dr Nguyen and work my issues out with him. So I went to my appointment thinking I'd try to get in to see him ASAP. But I was confronted by Teather, his nurse, and told he'd only do my pain pump but that he was on vacation. Then when he returned from vacation I was told she'd get back with me that day Monday July 24. But by Thursday I had still not heard from anybody there. Then I get a call from my pharmacy saying they sent a script (not pain meds) and they were told I wasn't a patient there. I called to find out why but they would only say a letter was sent out Monday. Well, it's Friday and I still have no letter. So apparently it takes over a week to get a letter from west side of Wichita out to Augusta!? I emailed Teather requesting an email copy of the letter and a copy of my chart but I received no response. I believe it's just a power thing for him and I've never liked the way he treats people. They have UA samples that stack up in the lab. It would be so easy for anyone to tamper with anyone else's sample. I believe that happened to me before. I received a letter from them one time stating I'd had no opiates in my system. But I had taken my pain meds every day. So there HAD  to be some in my system. So the lab tech either mixed something up or someone tampered with something. Also, I'd like to point out that some of the 5 star reviews are from people who do work or have worked at the office. I'd also like to add that if you try to ask anyone a question at this office that they do not wish to answer (ie they know they are doing the wrong thing) they label you as ""being rude"". That's how my mess started because I asked questions of my provider and she didn't like it so I was ""being rude"" and she stormed out. Now that, over a week later, after I've received my 30 day notice from Dr that he's terminating our contract and I call in with questions. I'm again ""being rude"". The 30 days notice is a joke. He writes it in such a way that it LOOKS LIKE he is giving me 30 days more care but in reality it's ""up to his discretion"" and his discretion is ""lifesaving meds only"". So my broken pain pump bolus machine that I'd been waiting for him to come back from vacation and get it fixed. Yeah he won't fix it! He's a slimy POS liar! I'd run far and fast! His staff is no better. He's trained them well. Nothing but liars all of them! They do not have patient care at the top of their list. They don't care about anyone but themselves.|Best in Wichita, no, Kansas, no, The Heartland! & I know; I've seen many doctors over my 30 - 34 yrs of living with chronic pain & ICT group & staff are the most professional & compassionate in my experience. Am so very grateful   for ICT! Love 'em ad astra|Dr. Nguyen is one of the most compassionate, thorough, and patient doctors that I have. I am in a great deal of pain all the time.

related experiences.   Dr Landers plays music while giving you your shots !!  I love this about him. He ever sings along with them. And sometimes I did too !!  Takes your mind off the pain.  He is good to tell you every time he is going to touch you and exactly when you will feel pain or pressure.  This is very much appreciated.
Had to go back to him 7-2017 for pain in lumbar.  I could have used another doctor but I chose him. Had the very same experience. Love this doctor.  Recommend him 100% and the staff is GREAT !!!!|Dr Landers was phenomenal!  Sang to me during spinal injection.  He kept things light and fun to get me to relax. Nobody looks forward to a needle in the spine....staff rocks, too!|About 2 years ago I noticed pain in my legs,  glutes and thighs progressing to severe debilitating pain. I couldn't lift my legs up from a lying position. My family Dr. sent me for an MRI and then to Wichita Pain Management Associates. I met with Dr. Landers, who showed me the MRI illustrating severe narrowing in my my spinal canal.  Dr. Landers followed up with 3 injections, 1 every 3 weeks. They helped but the pain returned. Dr. Landers referred me to Dr. Frimpong.

Dr. Frimpong consulted with me, explaining how he would relieve the pressure on my spinal cord. He was thorough and concise assuring me that he has done 100's of these. I agreed to proceed.

After surgery, I awoke and was joined by my wife and Dr. Frimpong. He asked how I was and asked me to lift my legs. Fearing pain, I hesitated. He told me to go ahead and I did. There was no pain, gone, I was overjoyed. I was released the next day. Dr. Frimpong performed A decompressive laminectomy L4, Laminotomy L3-4 and L4-5, Bilateral foraminotomies L3-L4. Thanks to the great staff at Wichita Pain Management, Dr. Landers and the brilliant surgery by Dr. Frimpong. I highly recommend them!

In Gratitude
James Moore|I moved to central Kansas about a year ago. I have advance osteoarthritis with miltiple levels of spinal stenosis. I had been using Interventional Pain Management  and was pleased to find Pain Management Associates.
I had already been through injections, nerve ablations, even a decompressive laminectomy. I need to have my lumbar spine rebuilt, my right knee and hip need replacement. I needed a pain specialist who wouldn't throw medication at me and see me every 30 days. Instead, Dr Jones agreed with me, that my weight was a problem at 150 pounds overweight AND I couldn't even walk to exercise due to pain. We discussed using an implanted spinal cord stimulator. I appreciated the requirement to have a Psychology interview. That really helped me vocalize my understanding of the stimulator and my expectations of what I wanted it to do. Basically, I needed a way to control my pain so I could exercise and lose weight. I like the way Dr Jones listens to me. Sometimes, I get to make decisions with Dr Jones and other times he makes the decision with my advice.
The stimulator is working well. My pain level stays around 1-2, all of the time.|Horrible experance, staff was friendly but the Dr was a joke. He scheduled unneeded appointments to make more money, to in the end do what my pcp ordered anyway. Find a different Dr and save your money.|Karen Dr Jones nurse makes my PTSD happen. BP as well.

I was in a lot of pain in my back for almost 15 years. I was referred to Dr Foster by my neurologist who took care of the kyphoplasty, however I was still in pain. Dr Foster was able to take all of my pain away with ablations to the nerves causing the pain. I would highly recommend him to anyone with chronic back pain, you won't be sorry. I am now able to do the activities I wasn't able to do before.
Thank you Dr Foster and staff for everything you have done for me.|Dr Foster is Awesome!! I would highly recommend going to see him for anything to have to do with your back, my stimulator he put in my back is amazing. He's kind, professional, and does everything he can to help relieve your pain. The clinic is very clean, very friendly, the nurses are great and check in is very fast and easy. The best Dr for the job to help you.|Dr Foster and his team are the kindest health care providers I have ever met. I went to him after a lot of other doctors who were less than kind to me and I had lost hope. Dr Foster was so wonderful and you can tell by how he listens to you and thoughtfully responds he truly cares about his patients. I had a DRG stimulator placed and it needed a repair but I didn't trust the doctor who originally put it in. Dr foster kindly took me on as a patient (not an easy thing to find in pain management) and fixed it. I now have almost no pain and I have my life back. It's also not only the clinic staff that is amazing it is also the surgery center team. I had a bit of a panic attack when anestesia was explaining the procedure to me because of a previous traumatic procedure. He took his time explaining everything and reassuring me the entire time. I never felt rushed and the team took it at my pace. They explained everything thoroughly before doing it and told me before touching me when I was laying face down so I wasn't startled. Every member of the team made sure I had no questions before moving on to the next step. They really eased my anxieties even before any medications were given. I cannot recommend Ascentist enough. Every staff member from the warm and friendly receptionist to the nurses. They're all just fabulous. Dr Foster and his team saved my life and I cannot thank them enough. I cannot imagine any provider at Ascentist healthcare being less than amazing.|I had an initial consultation followed a couple weeks later by a steroid injection in my lower back, it has been a HUGE improvement! I've had epidural injections in the past from other clinics and doctors, but not like this. Dr. Foster and his staff at Ascentist Healthcare and Ascentist Hospital have exceeded all my expectations. The thorough consultation, narrowing and pinpointing my pain to its exact location was the first step. Next, educating my family and I on all my options now and in the future. Finally, the procedure was extremely professional, the staff and the facility. I'm back on my feet again! My highest recommendation!! Thank you!|Dr. Foster has been caring for my father for the past 3 years and we are extremely grateful for his knowledge and expertise. He is always friendly, polite and shows concern.

However,  I am one who tries to put logic to a situation.  Not knowing everyone's situation, I was not going to base my decision on how Dr.Ain might be able to help me. I was going in for the steroid injection into my spine. The last three months, I have been in severe pain. A pain would shoot down my leg and almost knock my feet out from underneath me. I would have to give myself a pep talk to keep walking. Dr. Ain asked me where my pain was? I told him exactly what was going on, where it hit. He said, I know exactly where to go.  I was there about an hour. Everyone at the Spine hospital was extremely nice and informative.  Dr. Ain wasn't chatty,  but I was not there to become his bestie or go out to dinner with him. I was there for him to help me with severe pain. I feel he did a phenomenal job, and did HIS job! Again, he is there to do a job. He did that and did it well and for that I am so very grateful.  Looking forward to another shot because if this will fix me and I don't have to have surgery, that will definitely be a win! After the first shot, the paper said it would take full affect in 7 to 14 days. It has been one week and my pain is 90%less. That is a very good ratio.|Very rude and not personable at all! Dismissive of pain and he only will see you during procedures and not as an office visit to discuss issues. Very rough with injections and walks right out after. I was told I had a low pain tolerance and was also not a surgical canidate for another surgery. Thank goodness for my amazing neurosurgeon who is educated and compassionate who reviewed my images again and I am now about to have my next surgery! Dr. Ain is the most horrible ""Dr"" I have ever encountered in my entire 40 years of my life! Rude, unhelpful and very unprofessional! The only good thing I can say is the other staff at Kansas Spine were all very nice, helpful and Amazing! I just recommend avoiding Dr. Ain at all costs! Note: There are even some of his staff that acknowledge his rude demeanor!|Dr. Ain was able to help me so much with my chronic pain. He was extremely kind and informative throughout the entire process. Unlike other other pain doctors I've seen in the past, I would highly recommend him to anyone in the Wichita area.|I was disabled by the first epidural I received from Dr Ain. My spinal cord was punctured and a blood patch was given that didn't work requiring an ER visit 2 weeks later because I was still leaking spinal fluid, confused, and had lost my vision. Multiple specialist visits in Wichita and Kansas City with lots of money and constant pain all with the prognosis of this being an  irreversible condition of Adhesive Arachnoiditis with progressive nerve damage . Dr Ain would not call back the hospital when they called repeatedly for me after the incident. He finally responded 5 days later saying ""drink more caffeine"" and never further followed up. This has affected my vision, my mobility and my ability to work. I wish I had never allowed him to treat me. My quality of life has been forever changed and he just went on with his life like nothing happened.|Dr. Ain screwed up my wife's epidural so bad she is now handicapped. He punctured her spinal cord and then did a blood patch without permission. She developed adhesive arachnoiditis.  She is in constant pain and could eventually be wheelchair bound.  Kansas tort law protects doctors not patients, so no lawyer would take the case.  He never followed up and didn't care about the damage he did.|Dr. Ain is incredible! He is so kind, good humored, thorough, efficient, and precise. He has a great bedside manner, he seems genuinely concerned with the well-being of his patients, and all around takes his patients' problems seriously. I cannot recommend him enough! I have my mobility and a pain-free life owed to him.|I had the pleasure of visiting Dr. Ain for my chronic pain management, and I couldn't be more impressed with the care I received. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was welcoming and calming. Dr. Ain took the time to listen attentively to my concerns and thoroughly explain my treatment options. Their expertise and compassionate approach instilled confidence in me right away. Thanks to Dr. Ain's personalized care plan, I've experienced significant relief and am able to live my life more comfortably. I highly recommend Dr. Ain to anyone seeking top-notch pain management care.|Dr. Ain asked me specific questions about my pain which I appreciated.  He focused on what made my pain worse, how long I had the pain, and what treatments I had already received.  Dr. Ain was straight forward about his approach and gave me his percentages of his success, as well as, alternative therapies. He was patient and listened. I'm glad to report that after 3 injections I've dramatically improved. Dr. Ain gave me my life back.

Something did..they did an MRI but not a regular x-ray.  A regular x-ray would have shown a synovial cyst that they missed in an MRI.  After the 1st set of injections (alot of money) I told them that barely any relief.
So they did another round of injections....again alot of money.  After Zero relief I begged my PCP to refer me to someone else.  Who found the cyst immediately and problem was solved in 10 days.  I was in tremendous pain for almost 4 months from the time I scheduled an appointment till the 2nd injection.  4 months of wasted time in tremendous pain.  All fixed by a simple x-ray.  The 1st doctor did not listen to me; and the doctor who does the injections spends maybe 3 minutes with you in the injection never asking how it was working.  This place do not listen to the patient.

The good:  only the nursing staff seemed to care how I was doing.|They don't appear to ever answer their phones. And they don't have a voicemail set up.

The insane number of doctors I visited would not listen to me, because they said time had lapsed ""too long"" for the two to be related. This was said even though I sought out immediate treatment and had nonstop appointments. I gave up all hope of ever being my old self again, until I was referred to Dr. Khan.

Dr. Khan completely shocked me, as his treatments have turned my life around more than I could have ever imagined. He was the first doctor to believe that the amount of pain I experienced was real, and almost instantly had a solution to start with. He decided to do two rounds of injections into my upper and lower back. I finally had hope that I would be able to function like a normal person again, with longer term solutions. He also went above and beyond for me, an example of this is how he helped to get my insurance to see the treatments, as necessary. He tried multiple times, and I was finally approved.

The day after my upper back injection I woke up and was emotional. It was the first time I felt like I could be normal, and not live with a constant pain of 10/10. My pain level went down significantly, and I was able to do more activities I previously was not able to like bending down and reaching. The second injection that I got in my lower back, was mind blowing. I sat up from a nap that I had not long after my appointment, and I was crying my eyes out. It was the first time I had woken up in over 2 years, and I did not have severe crippling pain. I honestly forgot what it was like to live without the barriers that chronic pain creates.

To summarize Dr. Khan is an extraordinary man, that I have a profound amount of respect for. I would recommend him to anyone who is struggling with pain management, or doctors that do not want to listen. He taught me that you do not have to suffer in silence, and the pain your feeling is valid. Dr. Khan is also very understanding, you can feel that he cares about both his job and the people he takes care of. His personality is inviting and professional, and even after just meeting him for the first time I felt completely comfortable. He respected what I had to say; for the first time I was both heard and included in my plan of care for pain management. Dr. Khan is a live saver, and I will always be grateful for the life he was able to give back to me.

Another thing to mention is he is fast, precise, and amazing with the injection needles. I was pretty freaked out about the needles, but he always made sure I was okay and helped me calm down. He made a stressful situation easier to handle, and now I can honestly say that he has fully earned my trust. He is the only doctor I will ever trust with my injections, and pain management.|Dr Khan alleviated spinal and leg pain for both my husband and I with great success.  Ready to return since several years have passed and aging pains surfacing.|He has been my doctor for many years. Since about the time he came to KU. He is excellent. He has good bed side manner, listens, gives input, responds in a timely manner, genuinely cares for my over all health, and never is judgmental.  He also has relieved and worked with my specific situations. Zoohra is also extremely knowledgeable and faithful to guide and consult with Dr. Khan closely. What a wonderful team! Thank you Dr. Khan and Zoohra for all you have done for me over many years.|Dr. Khan genuinely cares about helping his patients with pain relief. Both my husband and I have seen him numerous times for procedures. He takes time to listen you.|Dr. Kahn takes time to understand your pain.
I have had 2 appointments and both were not a very long wait.   He comes in a greets you shakes your hand just an overall very polite Dr. And to mention his staff is incredibly polite as well.  Thank you all.|Dr. Khan is a pleasure to work with.
I had lower back pain and he provided relief

He gave me several options to consider.  I took some time to review them & made the best option for me that he agreed with as well. He took the time to explain any & all of my questions.  Cheryl, his nurse is kind & compassionate & Alanna, his assistant is so helpful too. Finding the right fit for pain management isn't easy.  I am thankful for having found Dr. Sigler/Optima Pain Clinic.|My mother and my grandmother have been going to optima pain clinic for the last 4 years and it's a great office and great environment Dr. Sigler, Nurse Sherly and front desk Mrs. Alanna are a fantastic staff we could not ask for any better doctors office staff that treats there patients like family and go up and beyond for every patient. Patients come from all over the region. My mother and grandmother drive 2 hours each way here. That's a total of 4 hours of just driving and that's 190 miles round trip. That just goes to show how good and kind optima pain clinic treats there patients and there staff. My mother and grandmother will continue to go to optima pain clinic for the rest if there lives and that's for a fact. I highly recommend going to optima pain clinic in overland Park kansas|Worst Provider and Facility EVER!!! Do not go to this office or waste your time with the provider! He would not return any of my phone calls. HIS nurse Cheryl is Mean and Unproffessional! I should have ran after my second appointment I was sitting in the lobby waiting on my scripts and people were just talking bad about him and his nurse and how they hate going there Introed it for myself and agree! If you want a pain provider who listens and cares about you as a person seek someone else Please please takey advise!! I don't want to go into details about my personal situation but just know he is not the one to go to! God Bless their evil souls..|I have been seeing Dr. Sigler for years and I absolutely love him! For once, I have a doctor who actually listens to my concerns, never pressures me into medications or procedures I'm not comfortable with, and he genuinely cares about your well being. The staff are all kind and amazing. Just an all around wonderful experience all around. 10/10 would recommend!|I've been going to Optima Pain Clinic since Pinnacle closed. Dr. Sigler and his staff are great. They have always been professional to me and his pain management treatments have been helpful for me. And Cheryl is one of the sweetest, funniest ladies I've ever met. The only downside is the gas prices to get there. Otherwise I'm very happy to be his patient.|Awful, awful, awful.  Terrible communication....it could have saved us the 2 hour wait and massive dissappointment.  My husband has had multiple back surgeries.  KC doctors are worthless, so we were going to Mayo Clinic and Univ of MN.....while waiting for more testing, the MN neurosurgeon wrote a referral to a pain clinic in KC SPECIFICALLY FOR short-term PAIN MEDICATION MGMT.  Sigler said 'sorry for miscommunication, I don't write meds.'  We are not paying thousands of dollars for injections my husband's already had which did NOTHING.  2 HOUR wait....no compassion.....DO NOT GO HERE.  Sigler does not look at the whole picture and treat his patients like family...total let down...just pushing cash cow procedures that are worthless and cause more issues.  F this place.|Oh my god if I could give a lower rating than 1 star I would. Dr. Sigler and his staff are by far the laziest staff I've ever encountered. No one answers the phone, no one helps with referrals, Dr. Reschedules appointments with zero notice. They also run scam services like bogus stem treatments.

Throughout Covid, NO ONE in the office wears a mask, uses hand sanitizer, etc... Even the doctor comes in the room for my mom with no mask. Despite she is on O2 and has COPD.

Horrible service, horrible doctor and staff.|They had enough notice when Pinnacle Neuro closed to start this clinic, but Nissa Fisher did not notify her patients with enough notice to get approved for their treatments to be transferred to Optima. She made it seem like suddenly this clinic appeared and it was news to her. They took my $60 specialist copay and said that's all I would have to pay for my initial visit to establish care when they first opened, but they still hadn't been approved by BCBSKS. I started getting bills for that visit for nearly $300 without deducting the $60 that I had paid. When I came to my initial visit, I said that I only wanted to do my next migraine Botox treatment and then I'd be transferring back to a neurologist due to other concerns. Nissa had her attending come in and they were trying to sell me on staying and it was incredibly uncomfortable. As I was finishing paperwork in the lobby after, I heard them talking about not thinking they'd get anymore patients out of Pinnacle closing and it was super tacky. No one answers the phone and they deny everything when confronted about wrongdoing, so I'm not surprised no one has returned my call about the bill.

I posted this 3 years ago and Dr. Faulkner is now gone. Mish hospital is not interested in your pain management. Went from a reasonable dose of pain meds to 1/4 just because THC is illegal in KS. I live in Mo. It's legal here. I can't get out of bed to do things like before. HEY, YOU SUPPOSE SOME PEOPLE REALLY NEED THE HIGHER DOSAGE BECAUSE THEIR BODY CYCLES IT OUT FASTER THAN MOST. When I go to the dentist, the numbing shot wears out quickly. So did my pain pills. They messed up on my monthly drug test and accused me of having THC in my system. Yes I have smoked some but quit when told to. I waited 50 years for it to be legal before I smoked again. Several months in a row. Was nearly dismissed by the assistant Dr for getting my tests messed up. I now am in pain like never before. If I knew someone else to go to I'd be gone.|Doctor Faulkner is the very best pain management doctor out there. He and his staff are very good at what they do. He is very kind and will tell you in detail about your condition and treatment options and makes sure you fully understand everything. He is the only doctor I have found who actually helped me with my pain. He is awesome!|Dr. Faulkner is a wonderful doctor. I've been dealing with a myriad of painful issues for several years. When I was at Children's Mercy on dialysis, a lot of these issues were ignored so I learned to internalize them. A few years after being transitioned out of Children's Mercy, these issues kept making my quality of life terrible and nothing anybody ever tried seemed to work. I saw one pain management doctor who wanted to do physical therapy which seemed entirely irrelevant to the issues I have (interstitial cystitis-like pain and severe UTIs, moderate to severe IBS pain, bad restless legs and diffuse body pain). I got out of his practice and came to see Dr. Faulkner. Right up front I was amazed by his thorough and acceptable pain contract. I love his openness to discuss the limits he has because of the CDC, while also stating that he doesn't feel like the limits will help anyone (as any pain patient can tell you, they haven't). On my first appointment, he was very understanding and accommodating. As for right now, due to his understanding and willingness to help, he's getting five stars from me. Yeah, it was a lengthy wait, but in this day and age, I am more than happy to compromise wait times for better treatment.

Dr. Faulkner expects evidence, which is entirely understandable. He still treated me even though my urologist didn't send over the most comprehensive information, but the nurse asked where they can get more info from and it was as simple as telling them Children's Mercy. Simply put, if you have records to get to him, getting them to him quickly is beneficial. It'll help him and you in developing a treatment plan. One thing I found particularly superior to a lot of doctors is despite not having every record and only having a partial picture, he didn't approach it judgmentally, apathetically or with disbelief. He started a treatment plan based on what was presented and as such I was able to start something despite the timely process of getting all the records in.

As of November of 2019, Dr. Faulkner is hands down the best doctor I have and have had. He shows genuine interest in my case since it is atypical and he actually talks with me about my chronic illness in a way that is very humble--nephrology isn't his specialty (obviously) and while he is still a doctor and understands it, he talks with me like I'm the professional...asking me questions instead of vice versa. It's one of those little things that I like about him. He's a diamond in the rough, really. He treats my quality of life issues

Adding to my fondness of him is his activism and his transparency in discussing the lengths he goes to to try and advocate for the strained field of pain management. I've become an activist of sorts myself and have written on the topic of the opioid crisis and some misconceptions for a few of my college classes, and in particular I wrote a lengthy research essay for my English 102 class to which I gave a copy to Dr. Faulkner and he gladly accepted it and genuinely seemed interested in reading it (I'll follow up with him in December to see if he got a chance to read it ) and when I said I'm considering organizing the Don't Punish Pain Rally for KCMO next year, I believe I recall he said he'd be interested in speaking or helping in whatever ways he can.

If you take nothing else from this, know that Dr. Faulkner isn't like most doctors--he's not walking around in a white coat with stoic apathy. He can be tastefully crude in discussing certain topics, and he's not afraid to criticize on some larger picture things such as the crisis in pain medicine for patients and the policies which have made the field so stressful for many doctors...even better, he doesn't ignore them.|Dr. Faulkner is okay. The appointments are rushed, usually behind, but I have been to far worse for Pain Management.

My major issue is their administrative staff. Unnecessarily rude, dismissive and downright unprofessional. I ""get"" that they likely deal with a lot of issues, but I don't need nor deserve the general disrespect and attitude. Trust me, I don't want to talk to their scheduler any more than she wants to talk to me. I DREAD any time I have to call there.

If I acted the way the do, I would not have my job. None of their system is online and scheduling is a hassle.. I recommend they record some of the patient phone call encounters for QA/QC.|Ive had to see many doctors in my life being on dialysis and having the issues ive had and Dr Faulkner is hands down the best doctor ive ever met . he truly cares about his patients and will do whatever he can to help them but he also wont allow people to take advantage of him either. Pain managment is probably the hardest dr field because u can get alot of people who try to abuse the system and get drugs. Dr Faulkner is super smart and can weed those people out. He does require records before being seen to determine if he will take ur case and if u get that opportunity dont mess it up because u will NEVER find a better doctor than him|Won't coddle you so don't expect a pity party. He is a realist who is working within tough constraints. Staff is polite. I do see him in Lee's Summit and rarely wait. Unfortunately, a lot of ignorance in the world is torturing pain patients. He is doing what he can to be an advocate. Many pain specialists do not even prescribe opiates any longer which has no real scientific evidence to back that practice. Many have quit out of fear of losing their licenses or criminal prosecution. Finding someone who can treat you holistically is difficult. You have to abide by your contract as it is a two way street. Those who are abusers of medication and other drugs are identified quickly. This keeps those of us honest pain patients from being lumped into a statistic.|I've read through reviews. I spent two long years in pain with no answers from the medical world. So many test and ""let's try this"". The daily pain was so bad that I had broken my back and didn't know it until two months later. I had been to two emergency rooms and sent home because they ""couldn't find anything wrong with me"". Had finally made it to Mayo clinic in Phoenix for an appointment but before that date I ended up in Mayo's emergency room.  They were going to throw me out. I told them I would tie myself to that bed until they could find someone to fix me.  Only then did they keep me. Still no real answers and short term relief. Thankfully I had an appointment with Dr Faulkner a few weeks after getting back to KC. In those two weeks I was back to serious pain. In my first appointment with Dr Faulkner I was in a wheelchair and was using Lamaze breathing to try to control pain. I couldn't talk to him. He could see how bad I was and prescribed a few meds. I took the meds and a two hour nap. When I woke I did NOT have any pain. NO PAIN! After two years of daily pain it was GONE! I have stayed on my meds and have slowly weaned myself from them to where I am only taking one opiod a day, hopefully zero by year's end.
Dr Faulkner.Thank you!
Before I met you I was not living. Just because it can't be seen, pain is real!!
Now, because of who you are, I am alive again!   God bless you for caring!|Horrible doctor! He was very unprofessional, he rolled his eyes at me the entire appointment and acted like i was a burden on his day. That's definitely not the way you want to be treated when your in real pain; which he tried to tell me I didnt have. Ive had issues since 2012 and have lots of documentations My orriginal appointment was to be in August and they keept cancelling on me due to him having an Emergncy, they messed up my appointment time, he was sick, and he just didnt show up one time. I didnt get in until October and when he asked why my starting paperwork was dated in August, I expliained what happened and he said ""Yea its allways my fault"" and scoffed. He gave me a perscrition and told me i could have one refill. When i got home i noticed the bottle said that refills require authorization so when the time came I was told to contact my pharmacy and it would be filled. I did so on the 14th and its been denied 3 times! So now im stuck with no medication and no appointment to get  a new doctor till the 12th!

He discharged me while suffering severe back pain just because of a video where I was trying to move my clothes to another apartment. When he was the one who  told me that I needed my back pain to be blocked with injections. He forgot that he was my Dr and his priority had to be my well-being, not the insurance company money. After he discharged me I went to New Jersey where another pain management Dr continue with my treatment. I was sent to see a neurosurgeon that told me that my condition will be for life. That my options were to have a spinal cord stimulation or surgery. All that after Dr Fox discharged me. All the physical and mental suffering I went thru because of him are irreparable. I was out of money and without work because I just couldn't work. Even my HR manager told me and told Concentra and Dr Fox that they couldn't have me back to work in my condition.

The times I went to see him, his team treated me very well. I highly recommend him!|My accident happened in April 2016. I went to MANY Drs to find relief fron the daily neck pain and headaches. The neurologist I seen told me a had post concussion syndrome and migraines. He gave me medication and it did not help at all. When I finally went to see Dr Foxx, he ordered an MRI of my neck and discovered I had herniated discs. He immediately scheduled me in for epidural infections. After receiving my 3rd injection, I was finally headache free. I have now been headache free for 5 weeks! I can not tell you how much pain I was in before getting these injections. Dr Foxx explained everything in detail regarding my treatment plan and recovery. He has a great beside manner and you can tell he truly cares for his patients. If you're in pain and can not find anyone to help you find the sources of your pain, I suggest you try Dr Foxx. He will listen to your concerns and answer any questions you may have.

Could not be happier with the experience.  Great communication and so far the results are promising.   Nobody needs to live with chronic pain.|The staff in the procedure room are horrible! This was the scariest and absolute worst experience I have ever had!!!! They don't wait for the anesthesia/anxiety meds to set in before starting the procedure. You try to tell them it's not working, and that you're still scared and in pain..they say it's fine and that you're supposed to feel it... if you squirm and cry when you are scared and in pain from the multiple spinal injections his sadistic assistant will tell you that you need  to just stop, lay still and learn how to breathe.. immediately following the procedure you will be expected to get yourself back up from the procedure table, and move yourself to another bed for transport...keep in mind, you better make it quick since they have been running late all morning and it's probably in your best interest  to not ask for help, otherwise you will catch a lot of attitude.

At this point I have lost all hope in getting relief and feel I am better off dealing with the day to day pain than to ever have to go through that again.

Also they performed another procedure recently that was also never submitted and was not approved. I have spoke to insurance, surgery scheduling, and office manager and gotten no where.

But in fact this office called me just a few days ago and left me instructions for my sedation. I also called the day of the appointment verifying the time of my procedure. No one at the time of that call made the attempt to inform me of this money due. This was a waste of an hour drive and the pain I have endured the last week not being able to take certain medications because of this procedure that I can't get done now.

She explained what would take place in preparation for my epidural injection. I had been seen two days earlier by Dr. Harper in his office. He was very kind and friendly. He took a lot of time to listen to me. After we talked about what had been going on with my pain, he showed me my MRI images and pointed out the abnormalities and where he planned to make the injection. On the day of the epidural, Dr. Harper was very kind and patient. He explained every step during the procedure so I would know what to expect. The procedure was painless and it did not take long at all. I felt much better after the procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Harper to anyone who has back pain.|Dr. Harper has helped us in an emergency situation with care, friendliness and concern.

During this period of time I've received multiple lumbar epidurals with multiple providers. I typically get good results. The last two were performed by Dr. Tokala and I must say he's a master of his technique. He has a professional demeanor, the procedure was quick and painless, and I've had excellent results. His staff at the Kansas Spine & Specialty Hospital were friendly and caring. I highly recommend Dr. Tokala.|I have been having neck pain for a few years now. I have been very nervous to move forward with a cervical epidural so I kept putting it off. The pain in my neck was keeping me up at night and limiting activities I could do. I finally gave in and went to see Dr. Tokala for an epidural. I am so glad I did! He was so kind and caring and made me feel so much better about the process. During the process of the injection, he let me know the feelings or sensations I may feel and he made sure to ask if I was still doing ok, and I really was. And within a few minutes, I was done. It was easier than I thought and now my neck pain is not near as severe. The staff was fantastic as well!
Thank you Dr. Tokala!!!|Dr. Tokala has helped me manage my shoulder/neck pain after a skiing injury.  He is knowledgeable and compassionate and I would highly recommend him to anyone. His goal is to improve your quality of life by helping you become pain free or reduce your pain levels as much as possible.|My first time seeing Dr Tokala was when I had a herniated disc after a laminectomy in an attempt to avoid another surgery, and manage my pain. I was afraid to have an epidural because in the past they were so painful. Dr Tokala assured that there would be no pain. I'm having back pain again 10 years after seeing him. The epidural has kept me out of surgery for years. However, the pain is back with a vengeance. I was excruciating pain during the procedure. Things have changed when it comes to the level of service. Phone calls go unanswered, it seems like an assembly line operation. I gave them a two because the nurse was so friendly.|Dr Tokala did my ""pain management"" all he did was the trial and permanent implant of my spinal cord stimulator. Once put in he basically handed me off to the Nevro reps and when I asked what would my next option be since the stimulator isn't helping at all. His response was ""I don't know. I thought that would solve the problem"" now he has washed his hands of me and my case. Also his office is extremely difficult to contact. Every time you call you only get the voice-mail and rarely get responded back to. I addressed this with the Dr and he acknowledged it and stated he knew about it, yet there was nothing he could do... So in the long run he is there to get his quick money and be done with you.|I've been a patient of Dr. Tokala for a while and have been trying different procedures to ease my back pain. Today I had an appointment with Tania Cox, APRN and it was enlightening! She was so informative, caring and compassionate. I left there with peace of mind that future treatment will improve my quality of life! I think they make a great team!|Dr Tokola has taken such good care of me. I have been seeing him the last 7 years. He has really managed my pain with epidural injections and radio frequency ablations. He is very smart.|So far this place doesn't deserve any stars. I have called many times to get my husbands first appointment. Left my number, work number with my direct extension... due to my husband drives truck and hard to get ahold of. They refuse to call me, even after I have left this as a detailed message. They have only tried to call my husband 2 times in 2 weeks.

I have seen many and this office is amazing Thank you to all at Pain Management|Dr. Parks and his staff are amazing! I would and do recommend everyone I know to come to his office for pain care. I am truly amazed by the bad reviews and find it convenient since HIPAA prevents physician offices from defending themselves and refuting lies online when such inflammatory remarks are made by people who likely couldn't/wouldn't follow simple instructions and recommendations.|I've had a pain pump for over 22 yrs so this does not include all the time spent in pain mgmt before the pump but I can honestly say I've had my fair share of Drs and different clinics but this was not a pleasant experience. A pump has a shelf life of approximately 7 yrs and because I've traveled a lot and lived in many different areas I've had to find pain mgmt clinics in several different states. It was time to replace my pump for the 3rd time and I was a new patient. After 2 surgeries where the new pump was literally protruding out of the open incision that would not heal I questioned a 3rd surgery to move the pump to the other side of my abdomen. This created tension among the staff nurses. Keep in mind I had been a patient for over 2 yrs and the only time I met Dr. Parks was right before the two surgeries. I was beginning to feel he didn't really exist. When I finally did meet him for a few minutes before surgery he was pleasant but all my dealings were with the nurses for 2 yrs. I walking on egg shells around them because my incision was not healing over a period of 7 months. I did not want to be one of those patients that was asked to leave but that was exactly what happened. Because of the difficulty of the pump coming out of my body and the incision  not healing I was labeled and told by the nursing staff to find another Dr. I had to remove the pain pump of 22 yrs and walk out of that office with very few options available to me. The only thing I did was question why I wasn't healing and why they thought another surgery was the answer. It was a very unpleasant experience for a person with chronic pain of over 30 yrs, 15 back and neck surgeries, a broken neck and Adult Scoliosis with two rods in my spine with over 12 six inch screws in my back holding me together. This was my 1st experience in being turned away from pain mgmt which left me with a very negative feeling  and the only options left were to go out of state or drive over 3 hrs to another city in KS. I thought pain mgmt was about treating pain and caring about the patient but obviously that's not what's important here.|I am so grateful for Dr Parks and his staff. Never a problem with my health and this year amazingly excruciating back pain from nerves and degenerative disc's. I came back a few times before they were able to nail down the problem but they did. Very grateful for Dr. Jon Parks and his skill, my quality-of-life has improved significantly.

I went to them for a super unique situation - teeth - they really don't do teeth; BUT they did have an answer for what they believe the problem to be but even better? After 5 weeks of barely being able to function, they were able to prescribe nerve-blocking medication and a stronger anti-inflammatory medication that has helped tremendously.

Absolutely.

I was misled into trusting this so-called clinic, believing their treatment would provide real relief. I spent $5,000 over three months, expecting results, only to be met with excuses, delays, and a complete bait-and-switch. They lure you in with big claims about pain relief and healing, but once you've paid, all you get is a long string of ineffective treatments that leave you in the same--or worse--condition than before.

I had multiple meetings with their second-in-command guy and his less-than-qualified team, each time hoping they would offer real solutions. Instead, they fed me the same scripted responses, the same weak justifications, and the same refusal to take accountability. And when I pressed them for answers? ""It takes time."" Right--just enough time to string you along until you've drained your wallet.

Speaking of money, expect to pay thousands for a service that does not deliver. And when you realize you've been scammed and ask for a refund? Too bad. They've already locked you into an agreement that protects them while leaving you with nothing but frustration.

Their entire operation is a bait-and-switch scam, preying on people desperate for relief. They bank on your trust, but trust me: you'll get nothing but disappointment, wasted money, and no improvement.

Already I am experiencing vast improvement, and once treatment is over I will be beginning a new treatment on my lower back compressed vertebra and pinched nerves. Thank you one and all for the wonderful time I've had trying to restore my health! I highly recommend Renuva for everyone suffering with constant knee and back pain.|Are there people who swindle people at the risk of their health? The answer is yes.
I went to this Renuva Back & Pain clinic because I made a wrong decision and received 3 treatments, but it didn't work at all and now I'm worse than before. The reason I'm writing this is because I hope that there won't be any more victims based on my experience. While I was receiving 3 treatments, I kept asking, ""When will I get better?"" The answer was a year later. Who would do this kind of treatment if they paid close to 9,000 dollars and kept getting worse? Even if you ask them to return the money after deducting the cost of 3 treatments, they won't give it back. The clinic makes you sign this paper so that they don't take responsibility for anything.
""The procedure is not guaranteed to relieve my pain, partially or totally"" It doesn't get better at all and it actually makes you worse,  so why do you keep doing it? Don't be fooled any longer. This is medical fraud.|As a veteran who's tried many different treatments, I would say this worked the best. The doctor was clear and concise in his explanation of the problem he will look to address( based on my pain, and the path to a solution to help me improve my range of motion and relieve me with some of my pain I've experienced since exiting the military.

I was also offered a military discount which allowed me to start my treatment immediately.

to top it off, the staff is very friendly and helpful.

I would highly recommend this type of treatment and this clinic for your pain management needs.|Told me they couldn't help me.  They didn't tell me why , but I think they thought I expected Medicare to pay for any treatment.

He was rude, obnoxious, and condescending. I don't believe he ever referred to my MRI results or fully listened to my account of symptoms. I was told a nurse would contact me to schedule a surgical procedure. I assumed they were waiting on approval from my insurance company. After a month, I called them and they just forgot. The last straw for me was he recommended I return in a month then after waiting 45 minutes in the waiting room I was told by a PA I had never met that I was early and that my insurance wouldn't allow further treatment for weeks yet. It was a total waste of my time and despite my objections they charged me anyway. His nurses told me he refuses to prescribe pain meds for cigarette smokers and won't fill out a form for a disabled parking placard.|To some, he may be harsh; but to me, he tells it like it is. He's straight and to the point. He isn't going to waste times on procedures that aren't going to help; which most doctors do so they can bill patients more.

The whole staff was inviting and very helpful.  I was comforted before my procedure and after.  They did a wonderful job.  I recommend using them if you are experiencing pain and need relief.|I've been to two different doctors here spanning a year. It is evident that they don't care about a patients quality of life, or the pain they are in. They refused to look at records from a prior pain management doctor who'd seen me & treated me for 11 years. Although I'd told them that injections have provided no relief, they offered an injection. I proceeded with that with Dr Elliot, and got no relief. I require surgery to remove a cyst that's pushing on my nerve, causing tremendous pain. I was referred here by the surgeon who's performing the surgery. His hope was that they could provide pain management until my surgery. I saw Dr Elliot again, and I don't know what the point of it was. She refused to prescribe a medication I'd been on previously that helped my pain, because SHE didn't like it. Um, it helped me, so why not try? She kept trying to give me meds that I'd tried previously and hadn't gotten relief. She wouldn't give me anything of substance,  because in her opinion it would make my surgery recovery rough. The surgeon sent me to you to PROVIDE relief until my surgery. She mentioned yet another injection, which I can't have prior to the surgery. It is quite apparent that she only cares about the $ from injections, and also mentioned a device today, that is also for the $. She didn't look at the diagnosis the surgeon sent over, nor look at any of my recent images. A doctor who will not be thorough while ""treating"" a patient has no business being a doctor. I will not return to this ""clinic"" and waste more time and money. I would not recommend this clinic to anyone who has any type of chronic pain, whose quality of life both physically and mentally is suffering due to the pain. Horrible bedside manner & did this recent visit in front of a student. Self medicating with Marijuana is a better option at this point.|I was amazed by the services provided to me by Dr Concannon and all of the staff in the office. I can't say enough about how friendly, professional, and thoughtful Dr C was .... I am feeling 90% better 2 days after getting my sciatic area injected and couldn't be more grateful! Truly an incredible experience :)|Dr. Foster is is the best pain management Dr I have ever seen. He is very kind and sat next to me and explained my X-rays and walked me through everything he was seeing and answered all of my questions. He did not rave through the appointment and assured me that we were going to get to the scourge of pain from my Motor vehicle accident. The staff went above and beyond! During my procedure one of the nurses sat right on the floor and held my held and talked me through everything. Finally a Pain Dr that cares and understands!  I am in the right place!|I've been to quite a few hospitals and dealt with countless numbers of doctors over the last couple of years. Not one physician or nurse has shown me the kindness, compassion, or understanding that St. Luke's has shown. Not only that, but they are the only ones to give me real answers! No one has ever dismissed me or doubted me, and that speaks volumes.|This office does not communicate with patients or physicians and list my medical records. I had an appointment Dec 30 and was supposed to be contacted for a return visit. I left my medical records there at their insistence, being told they would send them to me after copying. My MRI on CD was never returned, nor was written report. The initial appointment took 8 weeks weeks to get in and paperwork for referral was incomplete, yet neither I nor the referring MD was informed by their office. My treatment was never received and I had to find another office to  receive treatment. They do not know how to run an office. I wouldn't ever recommend them due to office staff incompetence.|I'm so very grateful for this place and the people all staff are wonderful amazing people Dr Tyler Concannon  nurse Joan Becky scrub Tech Wes Radiology Tech Shawn all receptionists in front all nurses I thank you all for changing my life for the better I feel like a new person with a brand new back I love each and every one of you and who ever you all boss is please give these wonderful people a raise cause they go over and beyond to get the job done right and good  again thank you all for everything from the bottom and top of my heart  Shante P|My grandfather was referred here for his leg and foot pain. As far as we are concerned his physician, Dr. Fraizer, isn't an issue. However, one of his staff was extremely unprofessional and impolite over the phone. Earlier the office asked to reschedule my grandfather's nerve block, which he did for a week later but by then would be out a medication Dr. Fraizer had prescribed him so when he called to ask if it was possible it could be refilled (as was written on the bottle) he was met with indignation and hostility for asking. I can understand if something is not possible, or that it might be frustrating to have someone not understand what you mean or what can/can't be done but her tone, language, and behavior were unwarrented, especially so early in the very brief conversation. I was privy to both sides of the conversation and was completely thrown off by her reaction to his questioning.",2024-11-05|2024-03-19|2024-05-24|2022-03-07|2023-01-27|2020-02-14|2024-03-12|2022-01-18,5|1|5|5|5|1|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do I need a referral?","Do I need a referral",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJieL1BcTvwIcRJFZofT9_vB0,20

They were always making sure I was comfortable or asking if it hurt. I had had an epidural a year ago somewhere else and was the worst experience. I told him and he made sure this was more comfortable. Took his time and made me the priority. He went over my issues and we made plans for my future issues.|I see a lot of negative reviews here, but Dr. Malburg and his staff were extremely nice, friendly, and caring. He was respectful, knowledgeable, and understanding. We came up with a game plan for my lower back pain. Many people are looking for Opioids and he clearly shows that he does not provide those. I'm a big believer in treating people as you would like to be treated... don't go in there expecting overnight miracles and or drugs.|Dr. Malburg is very professional and has not treated my symptoms with harsh drugs. He talks to you about a plan to treat the cause, which may not always be a permanent thing. During procedures, he walks you through each step to put you at ease. I really appreciate him not throwing drugs at me as the solution.|Dr. Malburg is an amazing doctor.  I had been to countless specialists and they had no idea on how to treat my symptoms. Saw Dr. Malburg for a separate issue, and he inquired about what I was seeing the specialists about and after the 1st procedure,  he took care if the problem. Went back to the specialists and they were amazed,  they never thought of his solution. I've now been his patient for years, and he always puts his patients first.|Seriously thought this place was going to help since my primary was leaving my clinic I was going to and I needed a continuation of my pain medication. Nope... went straight for injections with no compassion for the conditions I've been dealing with for years. I gave the injection a try and it didn't work. 1 of the worst experiences I've dealt with. I'd rather go through a vasectomy again . I Absolutely hate needles but I gave it a try. Focused on only 1 area. How is that gonna help everything else I deal with?? Still no pain medication and my sleep has gotten worse and I started gaining weight because I can't do much again. The doctor lacks empathy, compassion and simply did not listen to my concerns and/or the problems I deal with on a daily basis. Definitely got treated like a number and not a person .|Triage sent my referral here July 17th for a spinal cord stimulator replacement. I have been calling since July they still have not called back and refuse to return calls. Had my referral change to another city further away.|I just got done bringing my disabled mother to see ""Dr."" Malburg to try and get something figured out for her constant pain. The entire time he tore her down, belittled her, he consistently cut her short everytime she attempted to answer a question that he asked her, he wasn't interested in anything about her except to mention that she doesn't need to inform him of any medical conditions she has (even though he asked for them) because HE is the medical professional and doesn't need her to tell him these things. He also mocked other physicians asking her is she sure that they were qualified to do her epidural injections and asked if they were even doctors. I have never met anyone quite as arrogant and disrespectful within the medical field. He ensured her he couldn't help her and she doesn't need to make an appointment with him again and I ensured him that we would definitely not be returning. While searching for him to write a review, I found MANY others that had almost the exact same experience and I am unsure as to how a medical facility could keep someone like this within their building. Something needs to be done about him not only because of our experience but because of all of the people that he has negatively affected or brought down simply because they are trying to get help for their pain which is supposed to be his job!?! Oh and if it wasn't clear, I definitely do NOT recommend him to ANYONE!!!|I got told I just needed to get more comfortable in bed. Did nothing about my pain. Said me not sleeping was not getting comfortable enough. And my headache I've had for 2 months was my fibromyalgia. And if you have that he doesn't believe in that. He said take Tylenol.

Answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable!
I would see Dr. Jones anytime I needed good Orthopedic care.
All nurses & staff were wonderful !!!|I used to work directly with Dr. Jones on my eye surgical patients in Wichita. Not only was he highly skilled, but very caring and gentle with them. Many were elderly with multiple medical problems, but he was able to work though that carefully and accurately, with no problems. Additionally he did a few pain procedures on my back with excellent results, so I recommend him highly.|I saw so many great reviews about this doctor and his bed side manner but this was not my experience.
He was condescending and absolutely hates chiropractors. He would ask me a questions and then try correcting each of my answers. He told me my chiro was just going to give me arthritis in my spine and had many other outdated viewpoints on them.
He pitched one of the more invasive procedures for my pain before offering any kind of medication options for swelling and nerve issues, physical therapy or any other less invasive procedure. I left feeling belittled, confused and frustrated.|From the beginning the good Dr.Jones was not forthcoming in consultation &/or what to expect in any way shape or form as was his staff upon my repeated efforts to become informed. I canceled the July ""surgery aka injections"" as I couldn't  get any information about anything...no names, no consultation of what to expect. I pursued, as my pain is beyond bearable....finally got information & rescheduling  of surgery aka injections for Monday morning, Oct.30, 2023. Finally that very day; upon final outcome of presurgical consultation for injections, this good Dr.Jones dug his thumb in very forcfully upon the very spot @ right side base of my skull where severe head wound is located, causing horrible exacerbated wound injury to which I  cried out in horrible painful reaction. He simply walked out of the consultation room then repeated this again 15 minutes later when I was on my stomach on surgical table. I cried out in great raging pain both times to no avail.  The following injections gave an shock type of partial relief lasting well under 2hours, with huge exacerbated pain levels introducing themselves from double repeat acts of gouging into  my wound area. End result, I now have far more pain than I ever had before.  This guy is, at best; a sadist to be avoided.  Then Friday,  Nov.10, I received an additional hidden fee of $225.00 co-pay ""for facility use""
...THIS, after being reassured my insurance covers EVERYTHING,  that I would have no bills, no co-pays due.
This guy is a RIP-OFF at very best case scenario. He was wearing his street shoes in the surgery area as were his assistants...no paper slip ons which I had been instructed to wear the paper slip ons into the surgery arena to keep it sterile. He had crud stuck on the bottom of his left sneaker (his sneakers were blue).  This ""good Dr. Rodney L. Jones"" needs his license revoked. He assaulted me twice via forcefully digging his thumb into what was already a burning redhot poker area of severe head wound resulting in exacerbation that has NOT lessened.|I am very pleased with the entire staff and their procedures. I would certainly recommend them to anyone having pain issues.|Excellent Service and care. I was worked in on a timely manner. Physical therapy started the following week and my MRI was ordered promptly.|Dr. Jones has made a very significant difference in the back pain and leg pain I have been experiencing.  He is an outstanding doctor!! I  will continue to go to him and highly recommend him for pain relief.|Not sure why dr Jones just wanted to argue and be condescending. He decided not to help manage my pain, so I guess I lost the argument.

Everyone was so nice even the cleaning crew came in they were great and fun to visit with. Everybody went out of their way to make sure I was ok and made sure my husband had anything he needed.  The people that work there make this please wonderful|Hands down this was the best experience I have had medically. Dr. Barks is pleasant to work with. I had surgery and everyone from the receptionist, to the housekeeping staff (I wish I had asked the young lady's name but your head of housekeeping works harder than anyone!) are so friendly. Every person I encountered made me feel better, if not physically then mentally/spiritually. Courtney in pre op set the tone. Sara was one of the kinder people I have met. Please also thank Sammie, Taran, and Holland. They all took what could have been a rough time and made it as easy as possible on me.|Pre-surgery the staff was efficient and friendly. They were clear with the order of things to expect, post -surgery the nursing and CNA staff were so friendly and helpful. If I hadn't just had major surgery I would think I was at a resort being pampered.|My spine surgery was in late May, 2024. I could barely walk when I went in (Dr Ashley Barks was my surgeon). Now in October, my back feels wonderful!  I am so glad I went to this hospital for this procedure. From day one,  to the day I left, it was a good experience. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and explained everything. The nurses and staff that cared for me were the best!  If ever I needed this type of surgery again, I would not hesitate to go back.
It's a great hospital!|I have been an establishing patient since 2022. When I first started coming here, I loved the APRN Rhonda and Dr. Scott a lot! They were very personable and super thorough in their communication about my treatment. I lost my insurance in 2023 and had a pretty hefty bill to pay. I called to get options on payment plans to get it paid off but constantly kept getting transferred from the front office to a voicemail that no one responded back too. Soon enough I was sent to collections. I still needed to continue my treatment after I got a new insurance but because of my bill they made it very difficult to get established again (a year before they would get me back on the schedule). They kept calling saying they needed a new proof of insurance but when I would call they had my correct insurance on file just wouldn't get me scheduled. Fast forward to being seen today for an epidural injection, the front desk lady asked for my insurance and drivers license and with an attitude said ""have you ever even been seen here?"". She said she was new and kept apologizing because she didn't have any answers to my questions and had to call on her PERSONAL cell phone for help. I've had multiple epidural injections and have only needed a driver on the first ever one, she would not let me get checked in unless I called someone to come drive me. After frantically finding someone, I checked in with Chandlier and he was a saint! Made me feel so much more at ease telling me he could get me checked in even after 20 mins after my scheduled appointment. I asked one of the assistants if they changed their policy on a driver after injections and she said they got a new patient manager and it is now more reinforced. Anyways, I highly recommend Dr. Scott and Rhonda Janzen (APRN) but DO NOT recommend the business staff. If you need more accommodating and personable front desk I do not recommend coming here.|The positive reviews for this place are either paid or they had different staff years ago. My spouses experience today was beyond subpar, leaving in tears and they never cry. Her early appointment with the PA was wonderful so we had high hopes that they could help her but dam we were wrong. The nurses didn't verify who she was, didn't ask or tell her they were going to touch her, nothing was explained about the procedure, they ignored her when she asked if she was able to adjust positions because the one she was in was painful. Instead all they did was complain about office drama and their children while treating her like a piece of meat on a table. If you have the ability to visit another clinic do it.|Nursing staff and care is excellent.  The business office, specifically patient accounts is horrible. I've been called a liar, that I was ""wasting her time"". Has been very rude and totally unprofessional.  These actions have been from the Billing/Office manager Roberta Ryan. Issue being my account (which I owe and have been willing to pay) went to collections. I've made payment arrangements with this company AND also notified Roberta I had made arrangements to pay monthly. The amount I offered to pay was not of her liking and canceled the agreement with this company and demanded a payment of 3 times what I can afford. I admit I owed and will pay, it was not to her liking.  Issue being I'm recovering from stage 4 lung cancer and also have financial responsibilities to these providers. I'm disabled and on a fixed income. I had a long awaited surgery with fusions, the stenosis I had almost caused me loss of use of my legs. I don't want sympathy but MAYBE-JUST MAYBE some empathy and certainly not this unacceptable,  unprofessional treatment. Roberta demanded her terms for payment OR I wouldn't be allowed to see my pain management provider!!?? Talk about being held financially hostage. I had surgery in April and needed to be seen to ensure my course of treatment was headed in the right direction.  It's almost criminal, and certainly medically negligent on the business office part to be able to impede my medically necessary care. I understand the hospital policy is to have any balance payed off within 6 months of the first billing statement.  I'm sorry that saving my life from cancer is also important. Or maybe I should file for bankruptcy to avoid this hassle of being held hostage and treated in this manner. Patient's be ware. I've worked in Healthcare for 30+ years and have never heard of or seen such treatment.  I pray I'm able to make the payments being demanded or I won't see my provider, unable to be medically monitored and end up medically and physically ""Back sliding "" causing me to be hospitalized. The pain management practice is top notch, The surgeon's office and Dr's. are top notch. Any further testing, imaging and/or procedures will NOT be provided at the facility.  May the staff in the billing department have the day(s) they deserve.|Doctor Grundmeyer did a wonderful job on my mother's laminectomy. Her spinal stenosis was severe and surgery took a little longer then expected but she came out standing taller and no longer hunched over, she was up walking the first night and has had manageable pain. The nursing staff, physical therapist, occupational therapy were all wonderful, knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone was very nice, the receptionists were very nice as well. Nothing bad to say at all.

When I started my treatments, my quality of life was at a level 2 or lower (on a scale of 1-10). It really seemed like I was heading toward the grave.
In a short time, I have reached our short term goals of walking and driving my car (which I could not do before treatments). You are very fortunate to have Jason as the leader at this location. His professionalism and pleasant demeanor cannot be overstated. Many thanks to QC Kinetix. I'm still here and continuing to improve. Glory to God!|I went through all of the injections in my knees and I am now around 4 months out. I still can't go up or down the stairs without pain. There has been no change. Squatting and getting up out of a chair hurts. And I was told they would reach out to me after 3 months and no one has. No email (even checked junk mail) or call.  Waste of money. I know I had to try but sorry I went this route.|I waited a year to provide this review.  I felt great during and after my treatments, but time is always the ultimate test for fixing injuries.  I had my shoulder treated, I was suffering for almost 3 years of on and off pain, to the point I had to use a lot of pain killers, cbd, ice/heat pads and even physical therapy.......  I was still lifting weights during the treatments, and i really noticed the pain going away during that time.  I waited a year to see how golfing was going to feel, I played our entire season (30 rounds) plus many more on weekends and never had any shoulder pain.  This has worked better than I could have ever imagined.  Full mobility, no loss of motion, no down time, and the biggest, no pain.  This worked well for me.  I highly recommend this treatment.|I have had nothing but a positive experience with this great team of professionals. I had treatment done to both of my knees. I could hardly walk without pain before the treatment. Both knees were bone on bone. I now have pain-free walking and stair climbing, up and down. It's amazing what the treatment has done.  What a turnaround for me.|QC Kinetix is everything advertised and much more. The staff is professional, personable and truly help take the anxiety away.

I am able to enjoy life again, I am out of pain.|I am 73-years old and was experiencing a lot of joint pain in my knees which had me contemplating knee replacement surgery. I hoped this non-surgical procedure would help my body with its own healing so I began the restorative process in May 2022. To be honest, I was expecting immediate results, but learned I needed to be patient for the healing to progress. By mid-summer, my knee pain was gone and I was walking the dog, climbing stairs, playing on the floor with my grandkids, and finding those activities effortless again. I am incredibly pleased with my results and I found Jason and all his staff to be friendly, supportive, and very professional. This was a definite win for me.|I have been dealing with stiff knee issues for years. My daughter who is a nurse practitioner knew some people that went to QC Kinetix for shoulder issues. She suggested I try it out. I'm so glad I decided to sign up! I am moving better than I have in years. No I'm not perfect but I am able to keep moving from sun up to sundown. Just recently I took my granddaughters to a carnival and walked and walked! Before I started my treatments I couldn't hardly walk to the mailbox! I am still taking treatments.

The first set help my son. The second ones 8 months between failed. When he had it , the doctor was massaging the back of his neck and I saw the liquid coming out. My son felt a little better for a week or so. So we go back to see him and he tells me that botox is not an option for what is causing my sons pain. He gave two other treatments 1. Something implanted to shock the nerve 2. Finding the nerves that aren't working right and burn them sk they don't work anymore but because my son is developing disabled (6-8 yrs functions) he would have to be awake for that. My son can't get an MRI with sedation because he moves around. So I ask for my child to have tramadol because the other meds (meloxicam and Celebrex) were not working on him and he has an MRI scheduled to find out if it's scar tissue from two previous brain surgeries. This doctor sends me a message on the portal that his clinic is narcotic free and not one patient of his is on any narcotics. He also said my son should probably see a new pain mgmt doctor that our nuero only referred him for injections which is not true. It was even documented in messages in the portal. So if you are in horrible pain and need help. Don't go to Dr. Lam because he will refuse to give any narcotics even tramadol which is a weak narcotic.|Hostile and aggressive. Once I said that I had previously been prescribed an opioid (tramadol),  his demeanor became truly bizarre. I don't know if he didn't review my history before seeing me or did know before and was pretending it was new information when I said it, but both options are incredibly concerning. He made me feel like I was a horrible person for seeking help and trying to understand the source of my pain. He also didn't review my MRI but made a point to tell my boyfriend that he didn't need to because  ""the radiologist who reviewed it knew what they were doing"". Also, concerning for a doctor to address the patients boyfriend instead his patient. I walked out because no matter how many times I told him I didn't want opioids, he was more dedicated to his perceived reality that I wanted opioids than listening to his patient. I'm glad he and his ego are not part of my medical care team.|I am only putting one star as I can not give an empty rating. This was the worst medical experience I have ever had in my 53 years. My husband was with me to witness it. Dr. Lam spent 5 minutes with us today after I had an MRI on Friday showing degenerative disc disease in my neck that was severe, according to the report. Dr. Lam did not explain the MRI to us but was curious why I had a spinal fusion surgery in my 30s. When I told him I had a disc rupture, he asked if that had caused pain. Do you know anyone who hasn't had pain from a disc rupture or who has an elective spinal fusion surgery?  Dr. Lam avoided eye contact with either my husband or I as I explained that I had been suffering with severe neck pain. As soon as I said that my doctor who had referred me to him for treatment had prescribed me 20 Tramadol to allow me to take one per day to sleep for four hours, he immediately stopped typing, which he had been doing for the entire 5 minutes we were with him. He asked if I wanted surgery. I am not a doctor, we were there to get expertise about what to do about my neck. I simply told him that we wanted a permanent solution to my neck pain. He then asked if I wanted narcotics, and I said that I wanted my pain to simply be managed until I could get whatever procedure I needed. Then, without explaining to us the results of my MRI, Dr. Lam showed my husband a list of sketchy doctors on his phone who ""would prescribe opioids."" My husband took a picture to document this. Dr. Lam then ended our appointment and said I had been referred to him in error by my doctor and he was canceling the appointment so I didn't have to pay for it. He was abrupt, rude, condescending and highly unprofessional. My husband noticed when we came home and looked up his reviews that other women had experiences similar to me. I don't know if he thought I was some kind of drug seeker, but he could not have been more wrong. The way he treated me and my husband was so unbelievable. I can't believe that he is part of the KU network of physicians. My doctor of 20 years sent me to him for expertise, and he didn't even bother to complete my appointment or look at my records and present me with any treatment options. I would highly recommend seeking your care elsewhere if you want to be treated like a human being.|Extreamly professional and caring Doctor. I can tell that his office is rather busy so our time is limited. I ensured I had everything together for my appointment. Gave my background, revieded the CT and MRI's. Then discussed what I wanted. Pain Relief with the ability to get off of pain meds. In my case a SCS would be the best and sadly last option. He explained everything very well and from there was handed back to a nurse. I have since had another appointment with Dr. Lam which was my trial surgery. I am extreammy please with the proposed solution, Dr. Lam and the entire medical team that I have worked with. Every call, and portal message has been promptly returned.|Dr.Lam helped both me and my wife at different times (nerve entrapment and lower back pain, respectively). Both of these problems required quite different solutions, but they were the correct call.

More than anything Dr.Lam and his staff really wanted to help and (actually) listened to us. In my experience this is quite novel...and most welcome.

For my wife, she had seen so many physicians/specialists who could not help her. I mean like 2+ years of so many. But Dr.Lam was able to correctly diagnose her on the first visit, and treat her on the second.  If we hadn't found him, it's not far fetched to say she might still be dealing with her debilitating side pain.

So yeah 5 out of 5, would recommend|Completely wasted my time. Didn't know what was wrong or how to treat it. Pain management limited to epidural. I'm not going to be bullied into shot's in my back. Nurse that did my vitals had the same complaints as me. If she doesn't trust were she works, why should I!? Filled out information packet. Get to page 6 and it's already been filled out by another patient. The wait was long!|Came in for a consult or possible epidural and a referral to a KU spine surgeon. Instead I was treated like I was looking for pain meds!!! Did not like his attitude or the way he treated me. Incredibly insulting!!  I have been in miserable pain for four years and was just seeking help not drugs!!!|You couldn't pay me to allow this dr to keep doing procedures that never brought me any relief.
When I spoke up and said this isn't helping me, he still wanted to schedule 6 more visits.
I mean he gets paid rather my pain is still the same or not. He didn't care that my pain came from cancer.",2025-01-06|2024-10-19|2024-06-11|2023-09-13|2023-05-16|2022-08-04|2023-06-05|2023-04-03,1|1|1|5|5|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJR2a_uqLvwIcRTXbAwdZVTOQ,9

Got additional bill for 2 co pays of $25.00 each. Beware.|Referred to by my orthopedic doctor for pain management. Dr Ackerman is truly a fantastic doctor. I was scheduled for a epidural and was feeling very uneasy. He was very patient and explained everything thing that was going to happen.

He is empathetic, takes time to listen and gives careful consideration to what patients say and feel. He really cares and is a leader in the pain management field.  I can't fathom anyone being less than extremely satisfied with Dr. Ackerman and this practice.|Dr. Ackerman has been with me the last 5 years treating me for 2 separate injuries! He has been so supportive and helpful on making sure my recovery has gone well with minimal pain. He has never given up on me when times were tough.|Dr. Ackerman is a very professional Pain Specialist while at the same time being a warm caring physician who goes beyond the call to make his patients feel as relaxed and comfortable as possible!
In my particular case the ""caine"" meds do not have as much effect as they do in others so he covers more area and waits longer before starting the procedures.
I cannot express the relief I feel by him going the extra mile!
I know the ""review"" is primarily about Dr. Akerman but feel it important to also speak about the Staff and Facility: It (facility) is always super clean and pleasant. The Staff are also great friendly caring folks who also do the extras (warm blanket, extra pillow, etc.) In short, or long in this case I'm grateful beyond expression to be a patient of Dr. Ackerman and Staff at Midwest Pain Management!|Went in for a nerve stimulator for my lower back, trial went great.

He has a wonderful personality and has helped my pain tremendously, considering the fact that my back is a total mess. I'm not pain free,but he has the pain to where it's 80% better than it was. He listens to what I have to say,then gives me a choice as to what I want to do. I can't believe how much better things are pain wise since I've been seeing him. You can't expect things to be instantly better. These things take time. You have to give the injections and treatment time to work.|Edited to add update... I eventually got a diagnosis thru a different team. 4 years of pain until finally getting answers. Clinefelter was WRONG. I didn't have to accept that there was no option & I had to learn to live with pain.

Original review:
Met with him once. Did the consultation in a treatment room instead of office so was charged a lot extra. It automatically coded me as an outpatient at the hospital. All he wanted to do was radio frequency ablation. Once I told him I already did that and it didn't work he was rude & said no one could help me. However, I was referred there for trigger point injections. He did not even exam me but sent me back to my doctor saying neither he nor I could find the points. Completely unethical to give false information back to the referring doctor. You will get bill from hospital $234 for him using their treatment room & he will charge you a separate bill for an additional $375 just to be turned away.|Dr. Clinefelter is rude and very opinionated.  He does not allow the patient to speak; he is interruptive.  It is his way or the highway.  He does not communicate with other doctors.  I would not recommend him to anyone.|Dr clinefelter is a great pain management doctor, very kind and understanding doctor. The first shot I received went well, got a little shaky from the steroid shot, minimal pain. It only helped me for about a week to week and a half. So I was very optimistic going into the office for 2nd shot. I did both with sedation. Got the 2nd shot on a Tuesday afternoon. Going into that night had a pain by shoulder blade on left side that moved up left side of neck and down left arm to hand by Wednesday day. I had taken day off work, iced it, relaxed during day by Wednesday night I was in alot of pain. My mom took me to er, was diagnosed with besides neck, shoulder and arm pain, SVT.  First time diagnosis which could also cause some of left side pain. Here it is Saturday morning and have no explanation on SVT diagnosis and left neck shoulder and arm pain still present. With that said I have no idea if I just had a bad reaction to something from the cervical epidural at c7 t1 or it was just totally unrelated since the first one went well. NOW with all this said Dr clinefelter and i basically had same plan, no more shots, which is unfortunate because after the first one I had such hope to hopefully be painfree for awhile that i haven't had for so long. I stand by my opening statements that Dr clinefelter is a wonderful pain management doctor and would refer all that asked. I do not put any of the blame on hospital blame on him or the procedure that he did. As we don't have explanation for any of it anyways.I just wanted to let him know that if he ever see this. First pain management doctor that explained it, took questions, and listened to patient that I have ever went to. So in closing even though my last experience after appointment didn't go as planned. (Whether it was caused there or not) I would highly recommend this doctor and pain clinic and I understand the deciding not to do 3rd and agree. Just wanted to say I hold nothing against him nor clinic and I do not believe it was caused there just a coincidence that it happened in same timeframe. Thank you for time and service
ENRIQUE|He was terrible. When I saw him all he wanted to do was treat my back pain with very expensive shots. I tried one and it did nothing for me. He wrote me a narcotic script and told me not to come back.|Great doctor! Cares about his patients and how they feel.

He reduced my meds now I suffer because of it . Others refused surgery and injections and he dropped service to them . I continued because of needing pain meds , I see that ascentist dropped him but I think he needs to talk with a lawyer for unethical practices and violations of Dr's oath for talking against other surgeon because he didn't get a payback|I was referred to Dr. Mauricio Garcia because I have chronic pain. I have severe arthritis and need pain meds for it just to be able to walk thru grocery store and live a fairly normal life. I went to see him and he had a very arrogant attitude toward me. Said he would not prescribe me anything and suggested injections for pain. Here's the reason I feel Dr. Garcia is horrible. I told him in advance that both of my knees have been replaced  and also my right hip is a replacement. This Dr. and his so called female assistant were just downright RUDE!! Never trust this Dr. Nor his staff!!!! They treated me very badly. Did not even touch my joints to evaluate, and suggested injections. I had already told him both knees and my right hip were replaced and injections DO NOT WORK ON REPLACEMENT PARTS! Do not trust this Dr.!!He is judgmental and clueless about pain!!!|My mom came here after being referred. She left extremely upset because of this doctor who treated her with no compassion. She felt like the nurse and the doctor teamed up against her. Instead of listening or even caring about her or her health she felt judged as if she were out looking for drugs rather than looking for solutions to her health problems. Dr Garcia is a trash doctor. Go elsewhere if you wanted to be treated like an actual human being.|Dr Garcia  has been my pain doctor for over 20 years. He has had to draw blood from  my neck without anesthesia when no other veins were available.
Sure we have had disagreements about medication dosages when he has had to make the federal reductions according to their guidelines,
But I trust him hands down to handle any and all of my surgical procedures, they have been many.
I have  had 7 back procedures and quite a few neural blocks over the years among other things and nothing has ever gone wrong as long as I am in Dr Garcia's care.|I see this doctor has 5 stars. I wish I could have met that man. I had received a prescription at the beginning of the month on paper and my son accidentally threw it away. I was reminded of policy that they will not give another one, no matter what. So I saved what little I had and made them last until I could be seen again. I was given an appointment with Dr. Garcia. First thing he does is pointedly look me up and down. I'm overweight and used to this look and unfortunately, knew how this appointment was going to go and Dr Garcia did not disappoint in that respect. He asked me why I was there and I answered that I was there to have my medication refilled. I then got a lecture about how they are not there to just provide me with pain medication because I want it. My jaw hit the floor and I told him I didn't understand what was going on. He I had answered his question wrong. I told him if you wanted to know why I come to the Headache and Pain Center he could have asked that instead of phrasing the question to seem like he was asking me why I was there that day. It went down hill from there. The man berated me and talked down to me until I started crying, at which point he walked out. A nurse then came I was on the phone with my husband telling him what had happened and she heard about the thrown away prescription. I saw her checking something on the computer as if to verify that I had not filled my previous prescription. Then I had to do a drug test. Then he informed me that my MRI of my back was not in their records. This is the second one they have lost now. He also said that my X-ray was from 2015 and he's not sure what my regular hpc doctor was doing. He said I needed a new MRI (not an easy feat) of my back and new X-rays of my neck before he would give me a new script. Actually that's what he meant as he just kept popping in saying something and popping back out. I walked out saying I wasn't sure what had just happened and I was cussing to myself. I went to the front desk and asked to not only file a complaint against Dr Garcia  but my usual doctor who had threatened me twice on my last visit so I would do what he wanted me to. Dr Garcia's nurse came out front, saw what I was doing and went and got him. He came out, accused me of calling him a name and when I said I didn't he looked at his nurse who said 'You were cussing' at which point I told them that cussing to myself did not equate to calling him a name. I also said that I was no longer interested in talking to him and when he wouldn't stop talking to me so I could see about filing the complaint, I raised my voice and said IM NOT TALKING TO YOU. He then told me I was banned from their practice and if I didn't leave he would call the police. So effectively he prevented me from filing a complaint by instigating an argument with me so he could kick me out. No one should be treated this way and I should have kept my cool, but I had been kept waiting an hour and a half just to be berated. I hope anyone else who sees him has a better experience. I just know I'm tired of being treated by these people as a drug seeker when I've done everything they've asked and I don't come in looking like a drug addict like some of their patients. I'm currently looking into filing a complaint with the state medical board because there was no reason for this man to have such animosity towards me when this was the first time he's ever seen me.|I have had 11 spinal phushions and Dr Garcia had to step in and help me out and He saved my life .Thank you for your help Dr.Garcia need to see you here in mo|Doctor Garcia he's very smart&good at what he does.

Hes been my doctor for over 7 years. Hes very respectful and has never ever spoke to me like that I'm less of a person than himself.  I could put a list of 20 doctors that could learn  alot about bedside manner from this doctor.  And should probably take a good hard look at how they treat people.  Dr. Scowcroft has always had my best interest in mind.  And has always, let me be a part of my decisions and not forcing me into doing things I'm uncomfortable with.

They are an Amazing Group and I Love them all!!|Dr Scowcroft has helped me in ways other doctors never did.  He was my light in a tunnel of pain.  He had given me relief that I didn't know existed.  He is extremely knowledgeable and is a great

He also resolves my pain as quickly as possible. I have had multiple procedures with him and all of them have improved my quality of life. He is a great doctor and all around good guy.|My family has used Dr. Scowcroft for over 20 years. We've always received excellent care from this practice. He allows us to advocate for ourselves, and listens patiently.|He did the wrong procedure on me.
My personal experience with Dr. Scowcroft at the KC Pain Clinic was very upsetting. I was referred to Dr. Scowcroft from my orthopedic Doctor for hip issues. The order was for a certain hip steroid injection. Dr. Scowcroft did not follow the orders and injected the steroid into the incorrect part of my hip. My second issue was with Dr. Scowcroft's bedside manner. I was first scheduled to have a consult with him prior to the procedure. The visit lasted no longer than 3 minutes, I felt that he did not listen to any of my concerns, he interrupted me multiple times, and he finished the visit when he left the room while I was mid-sentence. On the day of the injection, I was very nervous and all the nurses and other staff were very kind and comforting. Dr. Scowcroft came in the room, didn't even say hello, did the injection, and walked out of the room. He never even asked for any identification from me. He didn't say a word in that procedure room. As I said before, the nursing and lab techs were all very kind to me. I solely had a problem with Dr. Scowcroft. While I am upset about the lack of bedside manner, that wasn't enough for me to write a bad review. But once I found out that he did the wrong procedure I was furious. I have dealt with my hip problems for over a year now, and as many know it is a slow process getting healthcare, that's simply how it is. But Dr. Scowcroft's mistake has set me back in my recovery. This is medical malpractice and should not go unnoticed.|Dr. Scowcroft has excellent bedside manner. Listens very well, answered all my questions/concerns BEFORE any sort of treatments, plus a dry sense of humor like myself.  I highly recommend Dr. Scowcroft and the KC Pain Center.|My experience was good. Not real sure about the lady at the front desk on the exam side. She seemed a little ""snarky"" most of the time.

I asked should I receive more and Mr Kingsbury stated yes I can receive more with additional cost. I feel they just snowball me knowing I would sign anything to help get relief of my pain. It was all about the money not at caring about my pain. THEY ARE SCAMMERS DO NOT GO TO THIS PRACTICE.

After realizing the mistake was theirs, they dropped it to $2,900. My test results weren't revealed to me and they just wanted to move ahead with payment. In hopes that finally I had found someone to help, I went ahead against my better judgment. Appointments were never consistent, no one ever told me about any progress that was being made, and here I am 8 months later, $3,000+less, and still in the same physical condition as when I first responded to the TV ad.

Helpful in getting insurance to file appropriate things. Very helpful in describing the process and timeline of events. I have had past pain management places just treat me as an ATM. I love the staff at North Kansas City Hospital as well.|I've never been treated so meanly by any doctor. He had me in tears within minutes. Initially I had been referred for shoulder pain. But within the 3 month wait to get into pain management, my rheumatologist recommended some stretches and my shoulder was feeling better. I have chronic back/neck pain from a MVA 5 years earlier. It had gotten much worse over the past year and I wanted to discuss that. He continually cut me off when I was trying to explain. I told him that I had crushed 3 vertebrae in my thoracic region. He asked what they did for my back and I said they weren't able to do anything. He laughed and said it must not have been that bad if they didn't do anything. I told him I was in a body shell for three months. Oh, he says. He just kept saying I was referred for shoulder pain and if that's better then he didn't know what he could do for me. I asked if this was a shoulder pain clinic or a general pain clinic.
I had him in the room maybe 4-5 minutes. When he first came in, a nurse opened the door and said something to him. About 5 minutes into my appointment, while he was being mean to me, a nurse opened the door again. I was in mid sentence and he said I have a procedure and out the door he walked. Mind you... I didn't get back into a room until 50 minutes after my appointment time. He came in an hour after my scheduled appointment time. I picked up my purse and left. This man should not have a license to practice medicine. He was wicked mean and I was nothing but patient and kind.|Since 2013 I have trusted Dr. Dwayne Jones as my pain management professional for my service-connected lower back pain.  He has been excellent at communicating with me and developing my treatment plan. The results I have seen from his treatment have been outstanding.  I liked his efficiency in time management and dedication to treatment. His demeaner led me to relax during the procedure instilling confidence in in his capabilities.  He advocated on my behalf through Veterans Affairs (VA) to approve a procedure which allowed me to receive the most optimal pain management plan available.  These procedures have allowed me to maintain my standard of living. With out his treatment my condition would have impacted my job which requires oversea travel, ability to enjoy social events such as sporting events, and outdoor activities with my family.  Dr. Jones has been able to manage my pain, allowing me to improve my mobility, flexibility, and activity level.  I would recommend and continue to see Dr. Jones, and his team, for any future pain management.|I have been going to Dr. Jones for a good many years.  He has handled pain in my back and both SI Joints.  He is professional and did a wonderful job taking care of the pain I experienced and did it all with no discomfort.  I tell the people in my community that he is excellent and personable.  I highly recommend him.|I was told by Dr. Jones that a back brace that I needed would be covered 100% by insurance. It was ordered back in September and approved by my insurance in September. Yeah they didn't send a bill into insurance until after the first of the year causing me to owe almost $600 for a back brace, I've called Dr. Jones's office. They tried to blame it on the person who ordered the back brace and gave me his phone number and told me that I needed to call him and tell him to correct the air with the insurance company called him several times and never got a callback once. I called North Kansas City Hospital. Patient advocacy department  They gave me two peoples names and phone numbers to call that could help me. I called numerous times never got a callback from either person. Looks like now I'm gonna have to get my attorney involved to keep from getting turned into collections over something that should've been taken care of  by Dr. Jones and his staff continue.
David Taylor|Dr. Jones did a trial Spinal Cord Stimulation on me and it went very smooth. The results were that my back pain was decreased by about 70%. He is going to recommend another surgeon to do the permanent insertion. I would recommend Dr. Jones for this procedure.|I was seen by Dr. Dwayne Jones on 5-4-2022. Never have I ever been treated so badly by Dr. Jones! He called me a liar. That I was seeking drugs. He told me he was going to call my surgeon and tell him I was uncooperative. He while I was crying was laughing.
He was extremely verbally abusive! I left in way more pain than I was when I got there. The staff could hear what was happening. They were very kind and helped me with a wheelchair so I could leave.|Thanks to Father God, Dr. Dwayne E Jones and his wonderful staff I am getting my life back. In precious Jesus name Amen

I'm very happy and trust Dr. Burfeind.|When my husband was seeing her, no one notified us that she was moving her practice. It took over 2 months of leaving messages for someone to tell me the office is completely gone from NKC Hospital & they no longer take our insurance. I thought she would have changed from when I was a patient. She was rushed when I was a patient. She threw her hands up when the injections were not helping.

In short, my husband is a mess after an automobile accident where he was not at fault.  The nurses are super friendly and personable.  The care he's received has been very thoughtful and thorough with attention to all of our concerns.  These people work SO hard and have a difficult job of dealing with people who are coming to them for conditions which may or may not have positive results. They have done everything possible to get some pain relief for my husband and have consistently adjusted the plan of care based on his reactions each time they try something.  Some of his treatments worked better than others, but, that is the nature of human body and the science of pain management.  They keep trying their best with their state of the art resources.
I have read some of the reviews posted that are contrary to our experience and hope that those people's viewpoints won't steer anyone away from seeing this doctor or team.

She has so much compassion for her patients and it is very much appreciated.|Was not taken serious, already made up her mind about my medical condition without any further testing. Her nurse was extremely rude. She canceled my appointment for injections and follow up saying my insurance didn't cover the procedure. She had the wrong insurance. Told me to just take 4000mg of Tylenol a day. No thanks, don't want to be on the liver transplant list. My PCP sent me there to manage my pain and she told me to go back to my PCP. Waste of time and money. Will never go back!!!!!!|I was referred to Dr. Burfiend by my primary care doctor. She started out nice and seemed knowledgeable about my condition, however as time has went on, she has become more and more rude, and so Is the nurse staff she uses! She is always rushing me through my visits, she's quick to dismiss me and my concerns. She acts like you're just another patient not a person. Overall, I have decided to leave her office and find another specialist, because I no longer trust dr.  burfiend, good doctor awful person!!!!!!!|I have seen Dr.Butfeind twice now and felt like both time my issues are not being taken serious. Both times I had advised her of the same issue and what helped and didn't help and she didn't seem to care or want to listen to what medication helped, just wanted to put me on medication that I did not want to be on.

From the first day she saw him she talked down to him and showed no compassion for his situation. She treated him like a convicted criminal and was more worried about her self than considering his condition. My father was 82 and mentally full of life.

My left hip was done but I needed my lower back done so I got in Saturday afternoon and got the correct one done. Now I'm waiting to hear the results and what needs to be done next. Meanwhile, I've got discomfort that effects me a lot so I take a lot of ibuprofen, 2 or 3 times a day.|Dr Kadhavi is a stellar physician. He's helped my back and knees with nerve ablation and injections. I trust him and he's very kind and interested during appointments offering options and feedback.

Since undergoing the PRP treatment for my hips, I have had little to no pain and have been able to return to kickboxing and weight training exercises like Squats and Deadlifts.

They always seems to go above and beyond my expectations with both their kindness and the care they provide.

I can't praise them both enough for their compassion, knowledge, hard work, and professionalism.|Dr. Khadavi is professional, knowledgeable, and caring! He takes time to listen and understand the root of the issue and get you the help that you need.  I have struggled my way through local medical systems and not gotten answers for years, but when I go to KCOI and talk to either Dr.Khadavi or Dr. McCabe I never walk out without either answers or a pathway to answers.

Not to mention, garnering (yet, another) negative review, consisting of the cosmic dust, from a single star...

The  (UH Building 2) office unit, appears to be an auxillary "" medical services"" corporation, which provides an insurance-driven, conveyor belt of appointments, X-rays, trigger point miracles, prescriptions, and other pain relieving goodies, for the afflicted....

Everything was routine: introduction of a new patient, submittals of paperwork, the ""does it hurt, here"" questions, prescription suggestions, and the availability, of future appointments....

In short, the staff was....o.k.The building, not difficult to find and a ""not-too-painful,"" Pain Management visit..

The front desk was peopled, with the usual cast of characters, who were grappeling, with another dull Wednesday---while planning, for their next cruise...

Ah, but the back desk----circular pen, for the appointment-makers... A sullen young woman, with 'more-than-enough"" braids, found my few questions, to be noxious----not to mention, the request for a single page, of paperwork to be copied.... This was due, to the medical transportation contact number, which was printed at the bottom...

The young woman stared, rolled her eyes, made a barely detectable ""sheesh,"" sound, and was (considering her general office position) laughably condescending....

On the way out the door, go the the receptionist's, desk-----preferably, while they are in the phone, ignoring you... This is not wasted time, because behind the two preoccupied women, is a large color-coded, dry erase board, FULL of affirmative plaudits... Talk about the delicious irony, of the positively clueless, modern office personnel....

The board is emblazed with drivel, such as: ""Be your own kind of beautiful,"" and cookie-cutter blatter, concerning goals, character development, being non-judgemental, and other ""really-hard"" self-improvement....The board's cheery positivity, is the exact polar-opposite, of the back unit's sneering appointment maker....

In spite, of everything, not too bad.... Everything was accomplished, and the staff is a director's hoot....!!! Just prepare yourself, to jump on the medical corporation  treadmill, and take a number.....|I have had 6 spinal fusions. I have lost 100 lbs and eating right. Everything  I need to do.

I've had plenty of doctors in my time that made me feel I was nothing but a number but when it comes to Dr. Misasi he has always made me feel like he actually gives a damn. There are a lot of doctors out there who do it just for the money but after spending a little time with Dr. Misasi you can tell he has a passion for what he does. So if you're looking for a doctor who cares about your problem and not your money someone who will be honest and straightforward look no further and you have found your doctor|I have a intrathecal pain pump. My pain Dr moved and set me up with this quack. He said from day one he would not do anything except fill pump. He made it very clear  Well he decided I was lying to him and getting pain med from my primary care Dr. I told him I didn't and he called me a liar more than once and dropped me cold turkey. If you have ever been through withdrawals you know what I mean. I'm thinking of getting an attorney for the hell he put me through. He called the other pain clinics, the pharmacy and my primary care Dr. He made sure no one else will see me. Yep. Time to v*attorney|I started out very apprehensive about Dr. Misasi but Dr. Sorrel recommended I see him so I went.  At first I was not happy but just approached him with my doubts and concerns and he was more than informative and took the time with me to explain and talk about what to expect.  The day of the procedure, it was way more intense than an experience with a different doctor and he told me step by step what was going to be done and then several times during procedure ask me if I was doing okay.  Today at follow up he was again very supportive and took the time to talk about what was to come.  I even made him laugh a couple of times.  I am much more comfortable going into the next 2 procedures.   I think it made a difference that I just directed my concerns to him and told him I was uncomfortable so that he know exactly what was going on mentally as well as physically with me.  He is human and not a mind reader .  I appreciate his focus on what he is doing.|This Dr here denied my Referral because I have a nerve stimulator!!
So what do I do for the rest of my pain from a broken back and fibromyalgia??
This Doctor didn't even give me a chance!!
All I wanted was to learn ways to get out of pain, maybe foods to eat and not eat!!
I know there's ways to do this!!

Anthony Estopare
Unprofessional service with disrespectful staff who have no concern on what is best for the patients. Amy office Administrator denies services and guarantees that the patients own insurance company will not pay for services when they assured her and myself over the phone they would. Major communication problems between staff they send you back for x-rays, get you in your exam room and gown saying doctor would be right in. Then the office administrator comes in and says they won't be able to see me because of my condition was a result of a car accident, No I believe and I'm sure many others would agree bone spurs don't happen from a car accidents they take many years to develop. 20 minutes after arriving post to my set appointment when upon being denied service, I asked to speak with the doctor, office administrator replies doctor has already left for the day, when five minutes prior he would be right in to see me. Always read reviews, be cautious and remember to this office the almighty dollar ""greed"" is the most important policy not taking care and helping the patient.|This doctor is absolutely fabulous!!  Very knowledgeable and on point!!  I was alittle skeptical reading some bad reviews on here but I'm so glad I decided to go anyway and see for myself.  Please go and make your own judgment.  I promise you won't regret it!!  The office staff, nurse, and Dr. Galate are wonderful, caring and compassionate people!!|My back was so painful and I could hardly walk. It was close to the end of the year and Dr. Galate and his staff worked to get my series of steroid shots in before the end of the year. It helped tremendously and I haven't had a reoccurance since.|Went to see Dr. He gets paid by INS. And dont care about well being or pain. Only cares about getting you back to work fast as possible. Looks good to INS to get more patients sent to him.
Worst Dr. For any injury hands down!|My wife went there today and left Dr Galate office crying. The man from what my wife told me, is very RUDE.

I went to the website and reached what could be done, and every experience has been pleasant. From my first call to set up an apt to my surgery. My case was a bit difficult, we knew surgery would be the end results. When submitted to insurance I was denied for the surgery, so Whitaker met with me and explained how they would go about submitting an appeal. My case was denied all three times by insurance. I was so worried that they would give up, however his Assistant Missy was in constant contact with me. And they were trying every way to think of getting my surgery approved since you could clearly see on the scans I needed help. We decided to start over my case, since I had been seeing other doctors in the process the first time. We were then able to get my surgery approved, and the team walked with me through all of it. I could hear them discussing ways to try and reduce the pain in the mean time. The way everything was explained and taught to me was amazing, I never once felt inadequate like I had at other offices. He took time to explain what my body was doing so I could understand, and he explained how the surgery would go so I would be at ease the whole time. I would highly recommend and encourage people to come see this practice for any needs necessary.|Best practice ever! Staff is caring and made sure they cared not only for my knee, but me. When I went to surgery with PTSD they created that! The OR staff made sure I had the meds and support I needed. They cracked jokes and comforted me when I was being put out. A few weeks post op when I came in for papers and they saw me limping the nurse saw me on the spot, and got the Dr where they did x rays and supported me. Call backs were quick and staff always took time to see how I was doing, and not just for my knee, but now I was doing overall. Would highly recommend. And Dr Bruner has the best surgical skills I've ever seen! Two failed surgeries and with this one im back to normal! And his PA is amazing to! I love everyone here and would go back in a heartbeat and recommend everyone I know. Heck already have as a nurse.|I was told I couldn't get my appointment until I paid a 200$ bill, which is just crazy, I've never been turned down from anywhere because of a bill.|This place is absolutely amazing! They patiently answered everything I asked while reassuring my family and I about the procedure. I honestly couldn't have asked for more.

She made me wait for 2 months before scheduling me for my spinal injections. This is continuing care and they have been doing these to avoid surgery at this time. After I arrived to what I was told was going to be my injection I have been waiting every minute to get because of the pain I was told by Dr. Hanley that they never received my paperwork from the VA and could not do it. I was extremely upset knowing she was lying to me. I tried to make an appointment 2 months prior but was told the Dr. couldn't even make me an appointment without a current referral. Mine had expired and the VA said they would send a current one. I told them one was on the way and if we could schedule it now so I don't miss any openings. She again said no they had to have the paperwork to ensure they get paid first. I personally seen it was done and they called me to make an appointment. Unfortunately it was for 2 months later and I was already in terrible pain. When I was seen it was not for my injections and nothing had changed with what I needed. She was short with me and told me again she would not do anything without the paperwork from the VA knowing she had it or she wouldn't be seeing me at this time. I told her I was going straight to the VA and see what the problem was. I went to the VA and set down and went over everything with a nurse. As I expected they were sent the paperwork 2 months prior. My nurse tried to call and it went to voicemail. My care provider then called to find out the problem and the office was on a half day and she was filling in. They did gave her look to see if they had the paperwork and she said it was definitely their and had been for months. Why she lied to me I have no idea? They knew I have been in horrible pain and could hardly stand because of the pain. This is not how a ""pain management"" company should behave. This is keeping me in severe pain every minute of my life. I had been waiting on this anticipating some type of relief every day and she could have cared less. The hospital sent me a review and I explained what happened and the next thing I hear back is they don't want me there anymore. This is horrible way to treat a person that has waited on you for so long and now I have no idea when I will see any relief. I haven't been able to work and had to hire someone to do my daily chores to help my wife around the farm. I will be filing a complaint the the Missouri Board of Healing Arts and contacting legal council to see what I can do. This is not how our medical Dr's should treat patients and especially when in severe pain with them as the only help. This is substandard medical treatment and I will be using all the social media platforms to expose her and what she did to me. I hope she tries to make excuses and lie some more, I recorded the entire visit once I seen how it was going. The recording will be on social media for everyone to hear her lies. She shouldn't be able to practice medicine when she has the power to do this to people. This is the worse medical treatment I have ever receives. Hope she is happy with what she did to me and had a good 1/2 day and long weekend. I am still in terrible pain and it could have been avoided. There will be consequences for her actions on this as I will not let it go until she understands it is not OK to do this. They treat veterans like they are expendable and our feelings don't matter. Horrible person.|When I met Dr. Hanley I was on large does of strong pain medication, muscle relaxers and nerve pain meds. She helped me to realize they were doing more harm than good. I got off all meds and we discussed steroid injections. This heightened my ptsd and anxiety due to past experiences with these procedures. She offered sedation due to this and changed my life. I will forever be grateful for what she has done for me.|Horrible, life changing experience with Dr Hanley. She's very disconnected and doesn't listen to patients. A simple procedure landed us in the hospital for 29 days and she wouldn't even return a phone call to help us navigate and a week later she left her office in Arkansas abruptly with zero follow up. I never write reviews but feel morally obligated to warn others. She's grossly negligent. Horrible physician.|My Husband suffers from Trigeminal Neuralgia, a very painful nerve disorder.  Dr. Hanley has helped him become pain free through treatment and medication.  She understands the condition, and we are grateful to have found her.|Dr Hanley was kind and seemed to care and want to help.
It ended up being a waste of time, money and more pain with a botched injection and emergency blood patch...

And in turn it puts people in dangerous situations because they go outside of the professionals to look for relief. And that puts them in dangerous situations that we have seen be proven detrimental and even deadly.|This team is really amazing! They are the kindest I have ever come across in the office that is with physical health. Really grateful that I made the change over here. The staff is so kind. They really listen and they really care. I highly recommend it.|Last week was my very first time seeing Dr. Lamborn and Michele. Extremely friendly, professional and they listened. So,  I'm thoroughly pleased with this office.

They really do care the whole place is nice and very clean. No long waiting The office people are nice also. I can't even say enough. Best place ever!|I have been dealing with chronic pain for a couple years and have been to a few different doctors to get help. I have been a nurse for 20 years and know how patients should be treated and I didn't find that until I walked into this office. I was treated with respect from the sweet receptionists to the back office staff. In my experience compassionate doctors are few in far between and I was blessed to find one!|It was my first visit nice office although it was a drive, I appreciate the referral from Dr. Peters! Dr. Lanborn and his staff are very nice and friendly and understanding of my issues and concerns and what is going on with me it is a lot I have going on I appreciate him working with me and seeing me.

I was telling them my other doctor did the same procedure differently.  They assured me they were doing the procedure as it should have been. I was somewhat skeptical, but went ahead with the epidural.  I was in about a 9 pain radius and 12 hours after the procedure I'm down to a 7, in that 10 is the highest scale.  I would like to apologize and highly recommend my doctors,  who were polite and curious to me during the whole time with me, even though I was questioning their procedure.  Once again I thank my doctors and who did my upper epidural.|I had formally been a patient of Dr Peters and I always got my pump filled there.

But genuinely I feel my pain is a lot easier managed and I don't feel horrible. Always read post care paper they give you it'll let you know what to expect and what to do. As well as any side effects you might need to know. Their team is very sweet.|Melanie NP is one of the best. She is very knowledgeable with my care and  takes time to listen to my complaints. I definitely would recommend Melanie. The staff is awesome, super nice and helpful.|Maddie did a great job of helping. Thorough, asking important questions. Giving me important information. Warm and friendly. I felt completely comfortable in the conversation. Everything went well.|Been with Commonwealth for years and I've been to several of their locations.

The nurses that watch over you in recovery are the best and nicest, making sure that you recover well from anesthesia and are escorted to your vehicle kindly.
These people care from the beginning to the end of your procedure and I appreciate it.|Epidural failed. They've got every excuse ready to tell you why. Do you think the doc's gonna talk to you? Or are you shunted to mean people paid to make excuses for him and keep the patients in their place?

They had a staffing problem. Pushed my appointment two weeks to the right. Day of the new appointment, they pushed it another day to the right. There were way more patients in the clinic than I had seen before. Everything was being rushed. Sedation failed. I told them I was wide awake. They stuck me with the needle anyway and probably missed after I nearly jumped off the table.

Yesterday 1/28/25 was my first visit, so naturally I was nervous. Pain clinics in general are hard, because you never know what kind of welcome you will get. Some Doctors and staff have no compassion, they just go through the motions,  others treat you like they are doing you a favor by taking time to see you, or they think you don't need to be there, while I can understand that they deal with people day in and day out , some of which aren't there for the right reasons, I think the majority of the folks who go to a pain clinic really need the help.Lord knows I appreciate everything they do for me! I've lived with chronic pain since an automobile accident in 1996. So I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when I got to Capitol Pain, the entire staff was super friendly. I seen Dr Andres , on Ring Rd in E-town Ky. Abigail was the nurse who took my vitals and went over my chart, she was super sweet. Dr Andres was Awesome, I wasn't rushed. He was friendly, patient, compassionate, and he listened to everything I told him. I am so glad that I made the long trip to see them. I live 88 miles away. But my experience made every mile worth it!|I feel all of the NP and Dr are wonderful. I believe they do have my best interest at heart. The nurses and receptionist are great,as well. The only negative would be trying to get hold of a real person in the office. I wish we could call and get a receptionist or nurse,if needed. Without going through other sources. Great job to all!!!|This pain management clinic is amazing, the staff is very friendly,  professional and helpful. Also, the doctors are the same. I had a family emergency and couldn't make it to appointment and they worked with me to reschedule. And I called back for an earlier appointment and they got me the earliest appointment. The appointment was scheduled a week and half from my originally scheduled appointment. I really did appreciate them for their help and understanding.|I had a very good experience here at the Elizabethtown office of Capitol Pain Institute. I usually see the Louisville office but due to my husband's schedule with his heart failure doctor appointment I had to reschedule my regular monthly appointment and I was able to be seen at this office. Everyone was very kind and respectful and was quick and efficient with getting patients to their designated areas. It was not a long wait before I was called back maybe 5 minutes. The person doing the vitals was very nice and done her job very well and was also knowledgeable and asked the appropriate questions that would be expected. I'm very familiar with the doctor as I see her also in the Louisville location. I have always been treated very good at Capitol Pain Institute and have been with them for going on 3 years and plan on it being many more years to come. I would highly recommend this pain management program to anyone needing this kind of medical care not only do they have very knowledgeable medical providers but the entire office personnel are the kindest and most respectful of any pain management program that I have visited. Thank you.|The nurse practitioners are great and the receptionist is just as good. I really like thT the receptionist knows My face and name.. You never had to wait in the waiting room very long. And they're always on time with my medicine.|I was really happy to learn that you all offered this, for several reasons we had a major snow and ice storm in E-Town and we had been without power since 6:00 a.m. Monday morning and didn't get it back until Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. along with that I was also sick so which made it great that I didn't have to reschedule my appointment. I really appreciate the convenience and that we don't miss out on any appointments that way|I have loved my visits at the Elizabethtown office. And love the treatment of respect and friendliness from all employees in the office.
Love the way Dr. Aleatha takes the time to work with me and assist in every way possible to help me get through my worse situations. I feel like God has blessed me with the Capital Pain institute family.|Hi I'm a patient here at Capitol Pain Institute in Elizabethtown. I've been very pleased with the care I've received. Everyone from the receptionist to the nurses to the nurse practioners have treated me with dignity and compassion. The staff takes time to listen to me and address my pain issues.
When I first started coming, I was having difficulty leading a reasonably normal life. Now, I'm able to do many activities I thought were gone forever.

She listens to my concerns and makes suggestions to help. Dr Gardner has been such a great doctor he was so great at not only controlling my pain but helped point me to the right doctors and diagnosis. So glad I came to his office|I love the staff at the Franklin location.  Whenever I walk in I feel like I'm there to see friends. They are all so personable yet professional. The wait time is reasonable and they always take the time to listen to me. They have helped me so much with my back pain. Without them, I probably wouldn't be able to get around as well as I do.  Dr. Unick is great when I have to have injections. He  walks me through the entire process of what he's doing.  I can't say enough good about this clinic and the people that make it so wonderful!|The staff and Kelly are a prime example of a generous caring and professional group of people that represent your company.  They're very knowledgeable about you and ask questions about how you feel. That means a lot. I have always felt comfortable on each Dr visit. Thanks for such an amazing group you have there. God bless always|The people are all super nice I have never had a problem until this last visit on January 29,2025. I was told by the girl at the front desk,Kelly the NPRN and also the assistant that checks you in the room that my prescription would be ready to pick up Saturday 2/1/25. I called to fill them and the prescriptions had not even been sent in. So I am having a really bad weekend dealing with this pain and everything going on with my back|Franklin Ky. office was a good place and friendly place. I really liked going there, but I was notified yesterday that Commonwealth,, Pain & Spine are shutting down this office. This is so an inconvenience for someone that now going to have to drive a whole lot further. When they were Interventional Pain Specialist you could call them and talk to someone at the office. Now every time you try to call and talk to someone at the office you have an appointment at, it is no way or possible to call the office. When you call you get an office In Louisville Ky. The person you may or may not get are some of rudest and someone who really doesn't care about you or your health. I was trying to have a procedure done and they were telling me I had to pay for something my insurance company said they were going to pay for but the office was told by Louisville office to take a copayment of $100 first before I could have it done. I was on the phone with my insurance company and they were trying to get a hold of Commonwealth,, Pain & Spine with me on the phone also to tell them it was covered we was on the phone for over an hour, started calling them at 2:45 my time which is 3:45 Commonwealth,, Pain & Spine time in Louisville Ky. We was on the phone till 5:10 Commonwealth pain & Spine time. They only answer the phone one time around 4 PM there time to say wait a second we will get back to you. We waited till 5:10 then I told the insurance company they close at 5 PM there time they would not answer or even talk to the insurance company. Commonwealth, Pain & Spine in Louisville on a scale from 1-10 would in my opinion would get a 1/2 of 1 for wanting to help someone a 0 for caring about your health and concerns and 1/2 for being knowledgeable about their job and how to help you. And something else happened all the time if the office does call you and you have to call them back on the number they tell you to call it goes straight to the office In Louisville Ky. You tell them the office called and you are calling them back to answer the questions they had, the office in Louisville will not put you on the line with the office that called you and they won't even give them a message. My wife and I have been looking at another office but haven't not found one that our insurance company that another company takes because of being out of network. We have complained at the office about we cannot call them or get a hold of them and all they will say is everyone has the same problem it nothing they can do about it because the office In Louisville thinks they are so special and want all the power they even want let you talk to your own doctor. I have been to a lot of doctors because of health problems I am so glad they don't make life or death decisions because the willingness to just not care about there patience. I even have one that was trying to bring politics in it, I think they was trying to find out who I was supporting. Like I said most of the people in the office are very nice but I have had one nurse practitioner that will not listen to you at all just keep typing on her computer your whole visit and when you try to tell her what the insurance was saying she wants to argue that her notes said you was a no show after trying to tell them that you was going to have to pay she was more like the ones In Louisville Kentucky but it is just one. In my opinion if you can find another company I would strongly recommend another company. But I  will say the actual doctor in the office in Franklin Ky. Are really caring person. And Dr Gardner at the Bowling Green Ky. Is a really good Doctor and care about his patients and really try to help.|I'm so appreciative of this place!! It's conveniently located within 10 minutes of my home, which helps on my bad days. With pain, we don't always want to leave home so this was the reason I started going here. The staff has always been amazing with understanding my situation and I have come to see them as friends. Amanda is hands down the best person in this office. She's very organized and always crosses all her T's and dots her i's. Mrs.McBrayer is supportive and kind. She's offered advice and guidance with possible solutions. I wish all my dr appointments were like this!|The PA that I see is so wonderful and I couldn't ask for a better doctor. She knows exactly what to do for me and is the BEST!!  I love her and wouldn't go anywhere else!!! More than 5 stars!!!|They was very pleasant and took time with me to explain some things i mabe going to do and how it works.

The staff and the doctors are fantastic. They actually care about their patients.|After experiencing mediocre pain management from ANOTHER ""Pain Specialist "" for 17 years, I find myself getting the BEST care from Dr. T. Beecham at Vitality pain Center. I've also seen three other doctors there and received excellent care.
Not sure what anyone else has gone through but my experience has been EXCELLENT.   Not to say that once or twice appointment dates have been transposed or whatever else. That's clerical. NOT the doctor.
Now, it is a Conglomerate. They have a central office that takes care of setting up appointments and sending messages back and forth to the different offices. If you need to speak to someone in a particular office, you'll have to leave a message at the main number.
All in all, great place for me!|Hands down the best pain management facility I've ever been to. Dr. Beacham listened to my entire medical history and understood my concerns and confusions with managing pain in this country. On my first visit he immediately started managing my pain and created a plan for the future. Best bedside manners I have ever encountered.|Dr. Beecham was very nice and seemed very intelligent.  That is the only good thing I can say about them.  I have never seen a more incompetent practice in my life.  They returned two out of 14 messages,   I went in for a trial and they locked the medicine in a safe and couldn't open the safe so I Had to come back another day, I am in a wheelchair and return trips from Shelbyville are not easy!  I had an appointment they said was a follow up from another appointment where literally I saw the doctor for one minute.  I canceled the appointment, when I tried to renew a prescription they gave me (non-opioid). They refused it since I had not kept the appointment, not telling me at the time that is what it was for.  They referred me to a surgeon for the pain pump, said it would be installed soon just for her to deny me.  When I called them and asked for a solution they took a week for another referral.  This one the wrong office called me and I have never heard back from the referral or Vitality.  I could go on but why, DO NOT ago there if you are not easy money they will cut you loose!|The staff is very warm and inviting. They have always made sure me and mother are well taken care of and that our appointments are scheduled and any questions are answered! The doctors have always discussed treatment options and followed through with the best procedures. They also listen to any concerns you may have and address them.

The office staff that I came in contact with appeared to be nice. When I was put in a room I answered the normal medical questions asked by a nurse then after a NP (a lady) came in...she evaluated me and decided what I needed. All sounded OK. However, I am allergic to a certain medication that she wanted me to take. She refused to give me a medication that was better for me and one that wouldn't send me to the emergency room. She is the first NP that recommended that I  take a medication that WILL harm me. I let her know that and it's in my medical history but she refused to change it. She must run the office and not the actual doctor because he never got involved in that part. Yes, he came in and talked with me and he seemed like an ok doctor. No doctor is going to give me a medication that I know I'm allergic to and that will cause me harm. I'm not gonna tell people not to go there because some people get treated differently than others. But this place is DIFFERENTLY not for me. I will not return. There's other places to go and if it wasn't I'm still not gonna take a medication that will cause me to go to the emergency room. I GIVE THIS PLACE A|I am a chronic pain sufferer and have constant burning pain over 80% of my body. I've also had major back surgery, and I have arthritis in my spine. When my pain is not being treated it continues to intensify until I feel like I can't breath and because of this my previous pain doctor had me on an extended release medication as well as a quick release. This did not come about easily, it took about 6 years of trying several combinations of medications to help to wrestle down this pain to get it to a manageable level so that I can work and be a functioning adult. Finally 3 years ago my previous pain management provider found the combination of medication that worked for me and I was able to work full time again. Well my previous provider closed down his practice and I was referred to this clinic. They completely disregarded my previous treatment and said I was on too much medication. They completely took away my extender release medication, they reduced the milligrams and cut the amount of my quick release medication in half. Now, I have NO treatment after like 8pm and through the night when my pain intensifies beyond belief, I've never suffered so much in my life! I'll take labor over this because at least at some point it's over. By the time the morning comes and I can take my medication the pain has intensified to a level that the first dose barely does any good and I've missed so much work. I've blown through all of my sick and vacation time and if nothing changes I will go back to being a non fictional non working adult again. That life sucked so bad and it's all over some pill count that was valued over my quality of life! I gave 2 stars because of hope, I am hopeful that this will change soon and I would love to update this review to a more positive review because I found a provider who cares more... we will see.|This place is amazing. The staff is not only friendly but the doctors really listen are super knowledgeable. They saved my life and that's not hyperbole. Tayza(spelling) was amazing and is a superstar. I can't thank this place enough.|The staff and providers at the clinic are very professional and truly care about their patients. They practice ethical healthcare and provide quality care to their patients. In my opinion, that is an important aspect of medical care that isn't found at many places anymore. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a pain management clinic!|I actually love this place, but today has reminded me of why I stopped injections.

They did not answer yesterday when we called to tell them we took off work for the appointment Thursday because that's what day we had the appointment in our calendar.

He analyzed what procedure would best help me get the most relief and the procedure has reduced my pain level immensely.

.|Came in pain and left in pain! I was told anything he could prescribe my primary care could prescribe so not sure why I was even referred if they don't treat pain! Don't waste your time going to them unless you only want an epidural. He wouldn't even prescribe a stronger anti inflammatory.  Horrible experience!|While I was so pleased with my first view visits, things quickly went downhill. It's my fault for not changing doctors sooner. One NP had me sobbing at the end of my appointment because they didn't foresee issues with changing my Rx, causing me a great deal of unnecessary pain for weeks. Dr. Sinofsky flat out said he believed his NP 100% over me. When I told Dr. Sinofsky I was seeing an acupuncturist he made fun of it. Things got better when I started seeing NP Crystal. However now they will no longer see me because I have rescheduled my appointments 3 times this year. I didn't miss them. I rescheduled. I have had chronic migraine disease for more than 20 years. I live nearly an hour from their office. I would have been happy to pay any fees for late cancellations when those happened, but no. They just let you go. The message just said they canceled my appointment. I had to call back & ask why. My biggest regret was not finding another doctor much sooner.|Really nice when I went in for my one appointment. I was supposed to receive a call back to schedule my procedure they wanted to do. Months went by and I heard nothing. I should have been more of a squeaky wheel but I finally went into the office to ask face to face what was going on. Didn't really give me a reason just told me they had now left a note  for scheduling to call me. It's been months again and have not heard anything.|I saw Dr Sutton my first visit explained that I need to contact them to get my med refills. That's great I did that with my other dr but the problem here is noone calls you back. 13 phone calls to them and noone answers or returns call. Saw aprn Friday she said she would send med order to pharmacy but guess what nothing. I might try to find another pain mgnt dr|These ""5 Stars"" are a LIE! I write this as I just finish comforting my mother as she cries again for the worsened pain she endures. I pray that the ""providers"" that ignore and downplay her pain, and that of so many others - SWIFTLY face the karmic retribution as vengeance for the souls who suffer and for each tear shed.

May you face God's wrath.

I'm frustrated and angry because I have watched my mother's condition STEADILY and rapidly decline since she's been in their ""care"".

I have to watch my Mom every single day grieve her pain and compromised mobility, all while they jerk her around with these ill prescribed medications and procedures. It feels like they don't believe her and are dismissive when she articulates her very real pain.

I've watched my Mother CRY due to her pain, more times than I ever had seen her cry in my life. As a daughter, you have no idea what that does to me. I've watched my Mother go from this independent, BUBBLY, joyous woman, living her life to a woman who is depressed, limited in what she can do for her life, family and self.

It breaks my heart and also affects me as much now. I am FURIOUS with this facility.

You all doing ""the best you can do"" don't mean a DAMN thing to me.

Sadly, my review doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things - but at least I have vented.|Unkind. Untrustworthy. Mostly everyone I speak to at this facility seems to be annoyed and like they don't want to be there, but also Dr. Sinofsky performed the wrong procedure on me.

Still - relative to other practitioners, he has done more to educate me about procedures and about the issues in my back, on the whole. I recommend coming prepared with your questions so that you can make the most of the time you get with him. So, if you are looking for a very experienced doctor who is at the cutting edge of his field, I would consider it well worth it to give Dr Hansen a chance. His practice has helped me immensely, over about a 4yr period.|Dr Hansen is the best Dr for anything, not just my back. I did however have a spinal fusion surgery last year and have been dealing with complications since then. The surgeon referred me to Dr. Hanson to look into the other issues going on, which there is a long list. But from day one I've had the best doctor experience with him and his staff send anyone else for any other reason. He takes his time, really seems To listen, the nurses that perform the procedures listen very well and relay information accurately... I cannot recommend these people enough if you're having problems that other places cannot figure out.  They have went above and beyond to help me with the pain and have not treated me like someone seeking meds like some other doctors have in the past.  They also work with me financially when I had a lapse of insurance that I cannot thank them enough for|EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to an appointment the staff, ALL the staff, are AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I've never met a friendlier group of people.  From the front desk to the people at the exit. The doctors are very understanding too.  I'm horribly afraid of needles and Dr. Hansen is so gentle and does everything he can to put my mind at ease.  I've been to 3 different doctors before IPS and none of them have been able to ease my pain from an auto accident in February of 2018.  I FINALLY am getting relief and have even had a few pain free days.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!|Dr. Hansen and his staff are amazing. I would recommend their office to anyone suffering with back pain. He saved my life. I was in so much pain and could barely walk anymore. I had to use a cane and walker most days and sometimes a wheelchair. Thanks to Hansen and his staff I can walk again. I can have an active role in my kids lives. I can actually live again. I owe them everything and so grateful I found his office. I have been a patient of his for now 20 years and wouldn't trust my back with anyone else!|""This happened in 2023. A few days before my appointment, I was notified that it was canceled because the doctor could no longer prescribe medication. This left me to manage my care on my own, which was challenging and very upsetting.

I managed to find a supportive Pain Management Office, but I remain concerned about how patients were left without assistance and why no one stepped in to ensure continuity of care.""",2024-07-17|2023-10-12|2021-12-08|2017-02-13|2021-04-01|2020-08-24|2019-07-01|2017-07-19,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Did they open back up","Does anyone know what happened??

They have done more for me in one visit than the last pain center did in 4 months. I'm still trying to pay them off. For nothing. Thank you for easing my pain. I'm so grateful!|I was really impressed with this Vitality Pain Center. Dr. Bosomworth was very courteous and took the time to listen to my concerns. He was very knowledgeable and explained my condition and treatment options in a clear and concise way that I could understand. I left my initial visit thinking, ""Why can't all physicians be like him?"" I mean, it would sure make the world a much better place.|I have found Dr Bosomworth excellent in his recommendations and in the procedures he's done for me. I personally don't like his bedside manners (or lack there of). Wish he were more humble and not arrogant (but that could be said about too many physicians).

The 1 star is because it is impossible to reach anyone on the phone. Even after leaving 3 voice messages, no one ever returned my call. There also seems to be a rotating door of new staff.

If you don't really care about staff and only about medical care, I would recommend this practice. But if you want/need the full package (which all patients deserve that), then I'd go somewhere else.|I been ok with them for years dealing with Bosomorth, and this horrible new doctor that I didn't ask for named Williams is horrible at his job!!! My medication been in his drop box and takes 2 seconds to send over to pharmacy. Haven't had medications in 3 days... My wife wrote a review also|Dr Bosomworth was very helpful on my first If he was a doctor, he shouldn't be. I was told his name was Dr Randall Oliver. A pathetic excuse for a doctor. He came in the room with accusations and talking to me very disrespectful right off the bat. He accused me of not being at the clinic for 3 months or seeing any doctors at first. Then the nurse in the room confirmed that I was correct and I have been there as early as last month and asked to see a doctor but there was no doctor available. When he saw that I was correct and he was wrong it made him very angry. The first thing I said to the nurse and to him was that the pills were not helping and I don't want them anymore I want another alternative that they can offer. Any advice or anything. He was not listening to me at all and he didn't talk to me, he talked at me. The he denied my pills thinking that would show me. But I had already said I didn't want any. But again he was not listening to me or talking to me. He was talking at me and said I was wrong in using cannabis and kept on and on and then just walked out of the room slamming the door behind him without any medical advice whatsoever and didn't care about my pain level which was a 9 out of 10. I have used cannabis for my pain and to help me sleep and it does work better than the pills did. and he put that down and said that since I do that he's not going to help me at all. But that was not the route to go. And now they will not answer any phone calls or return any phone calls. I will ever darkened their door again. I have actually reported him to an acquaintance of mine who happens to be the director of the Kentucky board of medical licensure, Michael Rodman. He shrugged his head like he knew who the guy was and said he would take care of it. Since the good doctor Randall Oliver at the pain clinic put down cannabis and said that it was illegal and wrong for me or anyone to use, I called my doctor and she referred me to the Kentucky cannabis clinic. I called an old friend of mine which happens to be the lieutenant governor, Jacqueline Coleman. A very sweet and beautiful woman, by the way. And she told me that the governor has already signed the legislature this past May to make medical marijuana legal in Kentucky. And it will be legal on January 1st. She also told me I should put in for my medical marijuana card right now because it takes up to 60 days to get. So I did go to the Kentucky cannabis clinic which was just 3 miles down the road from me. They were very helpful in helping me fill out all the paperwork and got my doctor's recommendation/ reference. The doctor there looked everything over and said it all looks good and I should have no problem getting my card in the next 30 to 60 days. Then he said I would be able to start my cannabis treatment January 2nd 2025. So I'm all set. I don't care what happens to Dr Oliver or vitality pain clinic. I hope they get shut down. Or at least clean up the place. And get good doctors. Right now the only have one good doctor which you're lucky if you get to see him but you will eventually see other doctors. I'm still not done with that doctor Randall Oliver. I'm going to follow through with everything and every means that I can to get that man out of the medical field. In closing I would like to add, cannabis helps me tremendously with no side effects or no harm to my body. The pills that I was given hurt my stomach and my digestive system and has caused me the other problems. Cannabis is natural. Pills are manufactured in a lab that often has many side effects for for many people. I advise anyone who has chronic pain like I do to go to their general practitioner doctor and have them send a referral to the Kentucky cannabis clinic. You should go there. You're treated with respect and not disrespected or talked down to at all.|I have been see Dr. David Bosomworth for over 25 years. He has managed my pain so I was able to enjoy the best quality of life I could with the pain I had. He always takes time to listen to what is bothering me and helps in every way he can. God Bless him and his kindness towards his patients.|Bad place to go. I give them 0 star. I've called 14 times and they our hang up which is highly unprofessional. I came in three days ago and my medication was suppose to be in they had me speak to a doctor over the phone instead of in person. This establishmentis highly unprofessional. My husband is in pain and can't get his medication called in. This is the worst pain management ever.|My son has been suffering with his back and knees for a long time. Dr Williams was so kind and thorough and the staff made sure his meds got approved.thank you for helping my son.after warning them 4 times that our pharmacy closed at 5pm and wasn't open until Monday..Dr bosworth made sure he didn't call his meds in even though my son was in so much pain his b/ p was 186/121.now he suffers until Monday...will find another clinic",2025-02-27|2024-12-28|2024-09-25|2025-01-10|2024-10-25|2024-10-21|2025-01-10|2024-07-10,5|5|1|1|1|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,emergency_appointments|pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ-aa8NshPQogRb5NWyW_nbmc,58

Unfortunately I've had no choice to undergo 7 surgeries for a preventative outcome..
Too make a long story short, I came to KY on November 5th leaving a LTC facility determined to find help!
Capital Pain Institute was extremely Timely, I had a New Patient Appointment almost the following week. It's important to confirm appointment arrival time and complete your Patient Paperwork. The staff was very efficient & accommodating When my appointment was canceled bc I did not know to arrive an hour early.
Overall I feel confident & optimistic that the plan with Dr Razeeq will be a success|The Capital Pain Center is a wonderful place to get help. It has changed my life. Everyone is kind considerate and caring about your health. I have had nine injections in my back and a nerve ablation in Greenwood, Indiana with no results. Capital Pain Center move forward, providing me to injections in my back that have gave me much relief nurse practitioner Anna Kesler is amazing she has showed me much concern about the physical pain. I was going through and has went above and beyond I could not ask for a better doctor or facility. The doctor that performed my two injections in my back was wonderful. The nurses were with me the whole time I was not sedated and very little pain.

The Dr. that I see Ann Kessler ....very professional and listens to my concerns. To sum it all up, CAPITAL PAIN MANAGEMENT is a great all around experience and I would recommend to a family member are friend.|I just don't know where to begin from the time I get there to sign in everyone is so polite and always smiling. I really love this Capital pain management. All the people work really good together and so polite. I love Anna my doctor. She is so sweet and always has time to sit and talk to me and go over things. Great work team. Keep it up|I have had a terrible experience with Captial Pain Institute.  I had an injection in my spine and woke up in more pain than ever before the next day. I was prescribed muscle relaxers which my pain isn't muscle related.I called and explained my back pain the day after injection and the Dr. Said there is nothing they would do but give me more muscle relaxers, which I did not need.When I asked why I needed more infections before further pain treatment,  I was told he was discharging me from further treatment and canceling all further appointments and to have a good day.This is a money scam and they charge $600 for injctions and they go up every visit after that. Just beware!|Not many times these day's you have every person in an office who are there to help any way they can and very friendly, but this place is just that. Very good people. The Dr's help you achieve what works for you and understands. Wonderful Dr's and staff.|I've been a patient of Capital Pain Mgmt for several years.

There is a nurse in with you also and the entire staff is so nice to work with. I recommend this clinic if you have legitimate reasons for pain and need help.

They charged me double for my copay, and when I called today to see what the deal is, they said it's for an old copay.  Fine... I don't recall missing any copays, but I can chek that.  My biggest issue is that they told me it would be my normal $45 copay, and then charged me $90 without saying anything else.  When I called, the woman who answered the phone said ""I'm the one who helped you, and I told you it would be...""  Except she's not the person I dealt with that day, so the phone lady certainly didn't tell me anything.  She put me on hold, came back, and said the other lady told me, too.  I said we'd have to agree to disagree, but they should please be careful to state the full amount.  She got really defensive and raised her voice and stuff.  Generally not a pleasant experience at all.|He is amazing. He cares, he actually cares. He has done everything to help relieve my chronic pain. I had an epidural in my back, it did not work. Instead of giving me more and wasting my money He said it didn't work so no need to try it again. When I asked him about different options, he gave me his opinion and I appreciate that so much. He isn't about the money, he is about his patients quality of life. I cannot imagine going anywhere else. I also love his staff.|This should not be practicing is very prejudice against patients.|The dr is great and talks to his patients and will listen to any questions I have or to any concerns.

First question before your visit became ""Do you have the shots?"". Then we would get a phone visit. Then the set it up to have my husbands and my visit on the same day. Great!! But we were treated very differently on these visits. I was required to bring my pills to count. Since I dont take my pills unless absolutely necessary, they got into this big pill count deal. I might have a few extra and we couldn't have that. There was such a difference in the way I was treated until I left the practice. I felt discriminated against as a female. There was also billing issues caused by their neglect that put a hardship on us.|Dr.Paspuleti is very much is what a doctor should be meaning he cares truly about what he does and takes interest in his patients by seeing each one and not just passing them to someone else in the office you go to see Dr.Paspuleti and that's what u get  and he also has the best staff they are professional  yet friendly if you could  give 10* they deserve it.",2024-11-01|2023-09-01|2024-01-22|2025-02-25|2024-02-19|2024-10-17|2022-11-26|2024-01-19,5|2|5|1|5|5|1|5,,,"2 p.m.|1 p.m.|3 p.m.",73.2|68.4|64.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Is this a good place to go .

Yes, there can often be a long wait time, but this is because Dr. Dubal will work patients in who are having pain & she goes slowly and carefully with her procedures. I'd much rather have to wait for a careful doctor than be rushed in & out of a doctor who speeds through a procedure.|Dr. Dubal is not just a doctor to me. She is a voice in my head guiding me. She dispensed sound advice.  Its been 10 years. Because of her, my life is wonderful. She not only treated my pain, she empowered me and scolded me when needed. Her advice has carried me far through the years like no other. She believed in me. If you are only looking for a doctor to sling narc's and are not ready to move into another direction then she is not for you in my humble opinion. The idea is to put in you a track that allows YOU to be the best you can be while taking minimal amounts of medications... not the other way around. She is slow, precise, and OCD about perfection. Wait times may be long because she loves the people she treats and everyone needs that time. be patient. This is not a regular doctor office. She heals people.

Dr. Dubal. I finally did the (At the time) experimental Ketamine Coma treatment. Its been 10 years of me with a second lease on life. Im sore a few days out of the year but im ME. No medications needed outside of some OTC stuff once in a while. I owe you my life and cant thank you enough for the love and support you and your staff gave me. It was a trying time. Thank you for believing in me until the tests proved I wasnt lying. I love you so much.|The  staff is comprised of COMPLETELY incompetent individuals. Poor wait time. The nurses will not return your calls timely after you've had injection treatments & encounter problems. You will never meet with the physician during office visits if you're  Dr. Dubal's patient. (Even when you request to see her.) You will meet with her assistant ""David."" He is horrible & has Terrible bedside manner.David is not a physician.He shows little to no concern, is monotone and passive to your medical concerns/questions. He will thumb  through a medical book during your office visit  because he is not knowledgeable. Save yourself the stress and take care of your health. Go to a Dr. who will be involved in your healthcare/ treatment plan and not just show up on the day that you have your injections.... That is exactly what Dr. Dubal does .Don't learn the hard way.Terrible facility.|Oh my heavens. Not sure what Dr you negative folks seen. But Dr Dubal is amazing ,  experienced , caring, total empathy and will do everything in her power too help manage all pain. Which mine is all over. She has went overboard for me. You cannot even compare via another Dr. Unless you are only looking for pills but not a life. Amen.  Thank you Dr Dubal and the staff is a class act.  Mary.|I found my saving grace in Dr. Dubal. She's brilliant, caring, compassionate and listens. From the 1st appointment to present day my quality of life has increased tremendously due to Dr. Dubal & her knowledgable Staff. Thank you all so very much.|I am a disabled veteran and I have been suffering with my right ankle pain for  many years.
I have been accused of drug seeking due to my pain. I have an injury that is nearly 40 years old, 3 surgeries later and a total ankle replacement and still I was debilitated by pain.
Thanks to all of the people who have plagued the system with drug seeking behavior, I fell through the cracks at the VA Hospital.
Finally, I was able to get a referral to APC in Lex Ky.
3 weeks ago I received Kenalog 40 and today my pain and mobility are not as bothersome.
I am here today to be treated again.
I have been seeking pain relief, I have not been seeking narcotics to get high.
I hope to be pain free at some point in my life.|Dr Dubal has been helping me by making the pain bearable enough to live with for about 10 years now
She's one of the most compassionate Drs I've ever been to

Another satisfied patient with a grateful heart!!! THANK-YOU!!!|I became a patient ot Dr Gary Reasor almost 12 years ago, after moving to Louisville.   He and his staff are exceptional.   They are genuinely concerned in their patient's well being and take the time to understand my needs.  I am grateful to have become one of his patients as I am living a less painful life than I was before.
I truly appreciate being able to function and sleep better than I have since the 1980's after my permanent back injury.  Dr Reasor tailors his help
to my specific injury & needs.  He has many different options and staff members who help in assisting patients receive great care to lessen their pain which improves their life.
I believe he is an outstanding physician who cares about his patients and their pain issues.|Metro Pain Associates has truly been a blessing from God himself and I am BEYOND grateful for Gary, Jessica, Kim, and their staff! They have allowed me to get my life back and excel in my career. I would recommend this clinic to anyone who has serious pain that affects quality of life. Dr.Reaser, FNP Jessica, and Kimberly are all very passionate, cool, and professional physicians with integrity. These are very knowledgeable and qualified medical professionals that will take great care of you safely and effectively, no doubt. Their treatment program has allowed me to build back my physical and mental strength. I also would like to mention that their front desk receptionist is a very helpful, kind, and understanding woman. Shoutout to Katy as well, she's awesome. I wouldn't want to be a patient anywhere else, 10/10 experience for me.|I am treated by highly skilled, licensed staff who are respectful and empathetic. Stem cell treatment is available here, as well as various types of spinal implants. Epidural and RF are performed in their on site surgery suite. Sedation is available for surgical procedures|Would give a ZERO but can't. They were extremely difficult from the beginning. I was in pain mgmt in OKLAHOMA and moved back to KY.  My Dr sent the referral over and my pain mgmt place in OK sent my medical records. However, they kept saying they needed a release of care saying I was no longer going to my last pain mgmt office....IN OKLAHOMA. You can't even provide this type of care across state lines. That was squared away finally and it was a 1.5 month wait to get in for my first visit.  I had my appt down for 7/25. On 7/24, they sent me a link to complete my paperwork for my ""upcoming appointment"". I spent 15 minutes doing so, just to have them call me and say my appt was THAT DAY and I missed it. I explained that I had it as 7/25. She even said she wondered why I did all the paperwork but didn't come in. Why is the paperwork do at the time of appt? Anyway, you could easily see that it was a mistake and not a no show. She didn't care...told me if I were to reschedule there would be a $150 no-show fee and it would have to be paid before I could reschedule.  She had no mercy at all...just kept saying, I am sorry that is the way it is. I am not even a patient yet. Very frustrating. Would not recommend and after seeing these reviews, I can completely see why it is that way....he seems to be all about the dollar. No thanks.|Dr reasor and staff are excellent and exceptional!

Arrived well before appointment. Signed in, but then sent to the other downstairs office. Signed in again.  41 minutes past appointment time, now empty lot I asked if my Dr is late? THEY NEVER CHECKED ME IN! Nope nope nope. Get your heads outta your @$$ and do you job. Dr left for lunch and still NOONE checked that they hadn't marked me off their signing sheet as completing my checkin?  Very disappointed.|Sent a referral two months ago and I finally called for them to tell me there was nothing they could do for me even though I was a previous patient for 10 years. I haven't been in the last 3 years because of financial difficulties but none of my conditions have changed, they got worse. Okay, no problem I will take my business elsewhere. They didn't even have the decency to call me back. They just left me on hold for nearly two months. Such unprofessionalism.|I recommend not even attempting to use this provider. It's clear they do not care about people living in debilitating pain. For a provider to say there's nothing they can do for you and will not even schedule an appointment to discuss your conditions (after submitting a ton of medical records) shows how extremely unethical Dr Manchikanti is. A professional who is supposed to help people but chooses to not even try is mind boggling to me. Maybe he realizes he's just not a good enough Dr. I am an upstanding human being with a professional career trying my hardest to make it day to day at work while in extreme pain that would cause most people to go on disability yet this Dr doesn't even want to try and help. Hopefully I can find a reputable Dr who does what he's sworn to do. I pray Dr Manchikanti never needs a pain management Dr that treats him with this level of discontent.|I have to take my mother thier. And it's unbelievable to me how little they care about their patients. I don't understand why they still have any patients honestly. She doesn't want shots they make her worse. Dr. Told her that without receiving the shots she can't get her medication? Why would any dr. Want to do a procedure on a patient when the patient tells them they don't help, but in fact makes it worse? It's all a money grab. DONT GO HERE.|refusal of service, my fathers pain medication has been ""under review"" for almost a week, and nobody will even talk to me about it, saying i ""don't understand"".|Dr Love has been my doctor since August 2011 before he ever got to PMCOA and has always been wonderful to me but I do NOT have much good to say about the office staff. I live 40 miles away and made a mistake by only scheduling medical transport for an appointment elsewhere because my PMCOA card was in my wallet and I was tired and hurting from having to unexpectedly move. I called the transportation when they didn't show up for my appointment at PMCOA on Monday April 1st and realised my mistake when they said they didn't have me scheduled so I immediately called PMCOA. I was rescheduled for the Thursday 4th and after the call I went to enter it into my calendar and saw that my day was full on the 4th so I called right back, this took about 2-3 minutes. They rescheduled me for the 9th then they called me right back and changed it to the 16th which didn't bother me at all. I called on the 4th for my medication refill I was called back and told that I was outside of the 90 day window and couldn't get a refill until the 16th. After the call I realized it was right at 60 days and then told that I had cancelled twice but I explained the scheduling mistake and that it shouldn't count as a second cancellation and was told to call back the next morning on Friday the 5th and speak to Jessica. I called several times and never received an answer or a call back. Jessica FINALLY called me on the Tuesday 9th telling me that she wasn't even there on Friday the 5th while not sounding very convincing and saying that I was outside of the 60 day rule instead of the 90 and that it did count as a second cancellation and that Dr Love had to be in the building and that with my medication none of the other doctors felt comfortable signing off on it and I told her that get other doctors named on my medication bottles all of the time and she had no reply just silence. I had to say that I shouldn't be told to call her the next morning if she's not going be there two or three times and that she should find out who told me that and to not do that before she stated that she would look into it. So now I'm left to go until the 16th without medication and when I said that I'd end up at the hospital she was SILENT.
There was a time a while back when I called for my refill and leave a message but the pharmacy wasn't hearing from them even though they were requesting my medication refill as well and this went on repeatedly with the requesting and me calling repeatedly without ever getting a reply. It wasn't until nine days after time for my medication that my friend and neighbor,a professor at MSU started making calls on my behalf and without my knowledge after he became totally disgusted at seeing me suffer. I don't know who he called because he wouldn't tell me but I received a call from the pharmacy and they said ""We have finally received your prescription,we filled it and it's waiting for you"" but I never heard a word from PMCOA about the matter and to this day I don't know why I had to suffer through that situation. I didn't ever mention it for fear of reprisal.
I only left three stars because of the redicunusness and unnecessary suffering but if it stars for Dr Love five stars would not be enough because he has been the kindest, most understanding and helpful pain management physician I've had in my 30 years of constant pain. Dr Love has never been unkind, always understood me, NEVER EVER been rude or walked out on m,hasn't ever performed procedures that were unessesary and or didn't help and hasn't tried to just drug me up out of my mind or prescribe unnecessary medication that messed me up physically and mentally HE'S AWESOME|i'm seen in the hopkinsville office, and have had nothing but positive interactions with everyone.  i've spoken to nurses a couple of times in paducah, but again, only have had positive experiences.  they deal with a lot of people most every day...i'm pretty certain there are some that are unpleasant.  but, nurses and staff can also have off days...we're all human.  anywho, nothing but good things to say!|My husband went here and the doctor did not even see him.  Laxmaiah Manchikanti, MD.  Did not talk with my husband and would not continue his pain management as it was at his other clinic.  Which had closed, so this doctor Sends his assistant in with what they felt was sufficient to give my husband for his pain.  Which turned out to be a medicine that weans people off narcotics, not for pain.

They could have called us before us making the wasted trip for nothing and saved us time and money.

They clearly don't care about people here, its the almighty dollar they care about.

He's offered solutions and taken time with me explaining all aspects of my care, treatment and procedures.

He's the best out there. He has the best bedside manor and has always treated me kindly. Him and his whole staff are the sweetest people and I always recommend my family members to go and see him. I've had one other pain Dr before Dr Lee and every time I went to see him, I always had to wait 4 hrs or longer to see him, but with Dr Lee I've never had to wait more than 30 min's unless he was behind or doing other procedures. There was one time that I really needed to see him and he was really busy but yet he saw me when he didn't have to and I really appreciate that about him. He's #1 in my book.|Dr. Lee was extremely compassionate and understanding. He listened and was very open to all of my questions and concerns. His answers were very thorough and helped to ease my mind. The first time I met him he walked into the room and knew IN DETAIL everything about my medical history and what I was struggling with.

He listens, asks questions, discusses possible solutions and is a great doctor. Wait time is never much. When I have a hard time getting through on the phone, I can get an email response that day. I love this place!|This is far the most worst clinic ever. I had an appointment at 2 o'clock. I did not get out until almost 5 o'clock when I went in they had just gave a lady a Anastasia shot in her back and she passed out in the last appointment. they did the same and the lady passed out, but it was a different lady each time they always try to talk you into getting shots so they can get paid more . They staff is lazy and rude and disrespectful. They expect you to come in for a pill count after you work 12 hour shifts and they do not have any other way to see your pill count like zoom like other doctors. The farm most worst pain management, doctor I've been to. I discharge myself|Dr. Zhou and his staff are great. I was going to another clinic here in Louisville, and they were not helping at all and only wanted me to participate in treatment that doesn't work for me. I explained everything to Dr. Zhou and he knew how to help. He is a great listener and has helped like no other! Highly recommend!!! Here is a pic of the killer goose outside of his office so beware!|Dr zhou has been my doctor for almost 20 years. When I first went to him he was at the pain institute on Whittington Pkwy now he has his own personal practice. Before he ever treated me I went to tell him my concerns about getting epidurals. He sat down with me and actually listened to what I said unlike a lot of doctors these days who stand in the doorway and rush you to finish talking. I found him to be warm and considerate. I trust doctor zhou and would not trust another doctor for my pain management needs. As a result I have referred several of my family and friends to him and they like him as well. The girls in the office are also warm and considerate and help as much as they can. I would hands down and without reservation sugget Dr zhou to anyone in need of a pain management doctor.|Dr. Zhou has been excellent in all categories regarding my pain management. I have seen other doctors and none of them have provided me with the level of personal care that Dr. Zhou has provided me with. The Staff are always super friendly and attentive to my personal needs as well. I highly recommend Zhou Pain Management if you are seeking a well respected pain management practice!|I met Dr. Zhou when I was in so much pain that I could not even sit down. I was discouraged and on the verge of applying for disability. This doctor has been able to manage multiple injuries and seems to remember everything about my life and what is important for me. The office communicates clearly and they keep it simple. Their technology is impressive because they always greet me on my calls, the email reminder stands out in my inbox and I don't get any annoying/unnecessary communications. The scheduled calls keeps me prepared before my appointment and I am usually seen on time. Dr. Zhou focuses fully on me for my visit, so I never feel rushed. Go here if you need a doctor and team of people who are results-driven!|I have had a great experience at Zhou Pain Management. The girls at the front desk helped me fill out my paperwork when I first went in and was too injured to do so myself. I am getting the help I needed after a truly horrific accident when others treated me like a criminal for asking for help. I am thankful for their assistance and kindness. Some other reviewers seem to leave negative reviews without providing any context and it makes me think they went in with certain demands or expectations. I have a lot of respect for Dr Zhou and appreciate him listening to me vent about my pain when I know he has to hear it all day from others.|Dr. Zhou is very knowledgeable and efficient, which is great when you're in a lot of pain. I believe they prioritize the patients getting procedures, which is awesome when you're in a lot of pain and need a nerve block or a cortisone injection - I'm usually out the door in half an hour. With sedation and things like radio-frequency ablation (which I've had here twice in the last 5 years - on my neck), I can't vouch for how long it takes since.. you know, sedation, but the results have been wonderful.
Staff is very friendly and greets me by name every time, and they make a genuine effort to help me feel comfortable. As a chronic pain patient with cervical stenosis, I hope I don't need to keep seeing any pain doctors at all, but since I'm probably gonna have to, I'm sticking with Dr. Zhou.

And even though you're taking your medicine correctly, if it doesn't show on their test, they threaten you through the mail with termination, but never bring up the issue in person. I know well and good it was in my system. (There's also another reviewer on here who had the same problem.). Performed their test even when I was on painful periods with heavy bleeding.  Had the correct count every month--God forbid I didn't.   And really, since the prescription says ""as needed"" system detection should not ever been an issue for their patients. If there was a pharmacy closure (which was often--they wouldn't authorize pick up at another location--often times for 3 days).  No returning calls--getting my first appointment required my doctor having to call them after many failed attempts. Horrible patient care!!!  But it was close to my job, so I continued to endure the obsessive measures. And their little ""not detected"" termination letter hopefully leads me to a more attentive provider.|ANGIE URHAMMER is the most amazing caring physician on the planet. She genuinely  cares for her patients and goes above and beyond to help keep my pain under control. I work 60 hours a week and would not be able to function if not for her. She keeps me up and running so I can provide for my family and earn a living. She honestly is my hero, my life would be unbearable and I would literally be paralyzed with pain. Her treatment plan has allowed me to return to work after a long downtime. She follows all guidelines and doesn't throw opiates down your throat. Until you have experienced catastrophic injury or debilitating pain, nobody can understand the vital role these particular physicians play.|I never met the doctor. They had called day before because doc had an emergency. Okay, I understand, but before I could open my mouth at all the receptionist took an accusing tone because they had left a voicemail the day prior informing me of a need to reschedule and I hadn't returned the call. I had assumed it was just a reminder message since I got it the day before and didn't check my voicemail. I wasn't even upset until she took that tone with me. Should've known it would be bad because when I signed in at the window she *actively* ignored me. Like purposefully avaided looking in my direction. I guess since they're located caddy-corner to the L&N Building, they think they should have the same attitude as the clerks over there. I won't be back. A receptionist is the face of your practice and if you choose her as a representative, I don't trust your judgment and I don't want you touching my back.|I have read the reviews and as of yet I completely disagree. First, I must say, Dr. Haque not only read my records but knew more about my condition than any previous Dr. I was amazed by his concern and knowledge.

Unfortunately, pain management has changed in the last few years. It used to be that anyone with a minor complaint could be seen and receive pain meds. This clinic cannot control what the FDA has done, the new laws and requirements. They are under great pressure to maintain strict records and must have rules in place to ensure that they will  not be shut down, to say it plain and clear.

So, I have a real problem with my spine and a disease in my spine so I have not been treated badly by anyone and hopefully never will.

People need to realize that they should write their congressman. The American Pain Institute has no control over the rules and regulations that the FDA is continuing to impose.|I was the driver for my mom who was having an injection and being sedated.  The waiting room was full. I was told I had to wait on her in the waiting room or she couldn't have sedation.  I am a nurse also and told them with COVID I did not feel comfortable and would wait in the car.  When she is done text me and I will be right up.  They said no but I could wait in the hallway.  People in the hallway did not have masks on at all so I explained that wouldn't work either. They still refused to text and refused to give her sedation since I did not want to wait and potentially be exposed to COVID.  I have never heard of a policy like this.  Common sense says the less people in the waiting room the less risk.   My mom waited for 90 min past her appt time in that waiting room before taken back.  She states during that time no one came out to sanitize chairs or anything. This was the Carrollton office.|I wouldn't recommend this place they are rude they never answer the phone or return your phone calls only open 2 days a week the doctor talks down to you the lady that does your blood pressure is only there for a paycheck I wouldn't put my dog there just a bad experience an you never meet the doctor|They NEVER answer or return calls! This place must be some kind of scam. Read all reviews and not the BS reviews that their staff is writing! Tired of wasting my time getting in here. Going elsewhere that's more reputable. They've probably been shut down is my guess since we have left messages every day for at least two weeks! If they can't return a call or ever answer their business phone, think about how patient care will be at this joint.|Angie Urhammer Is A Amazing Young Lady . She Has Really Helped Me Out .

The rude intake lady said they won't accept her as a patient because her referral indicated that she needs medication management and they don't do that. In fact there is no pain management doctor that does medication management at UK, so she will have to find an outside provider (even though all of her medical care is at UK). I asked if they could at least continue the stellate ganglion blocks that she has been getting and was told the doctors there don't do those. I asked what the doctors there do to help people with pain. She said they help people with injections for musculoskeletal pain such as back, neck, and knee pain. I said that's exactly what my daughter has been suffering from for the last year after having covid. She just rudely reiterated that they won't be taking my daughter as a patient. I felt like she took pleasure in denying my daughter care. My daughter is very medically complex and sees many different specialists, all at UK. This is the first time I have been treated rudely and my daughter denied care. I will be making a formal complaint to UK.|I have had several injections in my shoulder, lower back and neck. Dr. Christopher Mallard is very professional and I trust him. Yes, they do train future doctors but that should be expected at University of Kentucky.  No, the shots don't last forever but for 2-3 months I am pain free. It's  better than going under the knife for me.|Dr. Mallard and his staff are world class!
They have a real concern for their patients, and do what is best to manage their pain.|I recently was fitted with a temporary device to determine if I would find relief from my chronic pain.
Dr. Grider and his Staff took very good care of me with the placement, trial, and removal/assessment of my device!
The results were Game Changing!
Unbelievable! Awesome!
I look forward to having my permanent device implanted, and resuming a normal, pain free life!

Update; two weeks ago I had my permanent device installed; this morning I had my sutures removed!
For the first time in 29 months I am totally pain free. Dr. Grider, and the great folks at Good Samaritan Hospital took great care of me, and helped me get my life back! Thank you!|My primary physicians tried for months to refer me to a pain clinic, after 8 months it was either go to a pain clinic for help or have my arm amputated the pain was unbearable. I chose UK Interventional Pain Associates because I have several health issues, my primary physician and specialist are at UK therefore the pain clinic would have access to all my medical records.

I had no issues with the staff or physicians. I was seen timely, treated very well. However now I question everything at this clinic.

I was seen seen the first week of August all went well they added a muscle relaxer in addition to pain medication and sent me on my way with a follow up visit 10.1.18. On Aug. 24 I received a letter dated 8/6/18 discharging me from their clinic for two reasons 1-tested positive for methadone 2-for not improving.....
First) I don't take methadone and don't know anyone who takes methadone. Second) as for not improving...I must disagree, I see immunology, pulmonary specialist at least monthly at UK hosp. Because I see the pain doctors I'm able to keep those appointments, before I would have to reschedule until I was having a deceit day. These specialist have cut down on my inpatient stays in the hospital.
How is it not physician abandonment to mail a dear John letter to a chronically I'll patient. I know they have regulatory hoops to jump thru but don't they have ethics that patient care must come before regulatory issues. Very dishearten & disappointed in the whole process.|I had one appointment at this pain clinic for severe chronic back pain. They prescribed me a pain medicine for once a day at 50 mg, a very small amount which was fine. I month  later I received a letter saying that I tested positive for a drug that I've never heard of and have never taken and never will. I tried to call to clarify the mistake and ask them to do a repeat on the urine analysis and return my to return my calls. They never responded and said that I cannot come back. I do not even want my pain medicine, I just want this clarified that I have never taken an opioid and I have contacted my attorney to file a lawsuit against them.|Update! It's now been six weeks and still no appointment scheduled...

Treatment received is good WHEN YOU CAN GET IT! I had an appointment, and they wouldn't let me schedule my next appointment in office (every 30 days) and told me I'd have to call to make another appointment. So, I called and they don't make appointments over the phone. Told me I would get a call back so I waited and waited and waited (in pain). It's been two weeks since I called to request my next appointment. I called back again today and was told it's still waiting approval. I'm now wondering if they'll even see me or if I need to go back to my primary care doc and find a new provider. Also, receptionist is consistently rude. Doctors have good beside manner, however. I've never experienced another office taking weeks and weeks to sign a piece of paper so they can allow you to make an appointment. If you're in pain, don't expect to be seen promptly or even on schedule.|I went there for pain. Cyst on spine. I have had two shots for pain in last 8 yrs. Went to this clinic to see about getting another shots. The pain starts gradually at the base of my spine. If I let it go without shots the pain gets worse and overtime I can't walk or straighten up. They told me insurance would not cover it. I called back and they said they were working on something else to get it approved. Heard nothing called back left message. Now 4 weeks ago and no call back. Called insurance and according to them the clinic never called or sent in paper work. So now I am in extreme pain and can't walk very far.

If it is only due to staff filling scripts, he should be able to return to his practice. I really miss this doctor he gave great ephirduals. I was a patient for 26yrs.|Dr. Peters was the best Dr hands down I've ever had for my pain issues. I do hope he comes back as I seen he is on a 1 year probation only, so we are rooting for you Doc.|Dr peters was the first doctor that actually listened to me and helped my pain after having a vehicle accident with a semi truck. My pain was real and I felt crippled however that doesn't matter in a world like today because the bills don't stop and I had to continue to work. I am a single mother with no help so I had to keep working. If it wasn't for Dr Peter's I would have had to file for short term disability. Dr Peter's listened to my concerns and took me serious without judgement since I am younger.  He helped me to continue to live my life and do most (not all) of my daily activities by treating my pain. He was always honest with me and I was always honest with him about how I was doing. He is very smart and kind. He gave me a few spinal epidurals which also helped me gain mobility back directly after my accident. Dr Peter's staff was great and always provided in a timely manner. Thank you Dr Peter's for helping me get back on track to normalcy. God speed.|I was in so much sciatica nerve pain and was not only in pain but depressed from having to lay in bed crying as much as I had to breath I could count on the pain.Went to Dr after Dr after Dr tests that that they would put me though and money I spent trying to just feel li ke I was worth more than just trying to do regular things most people take for granted they can do without pain. He examined me thourly and gave me meds to help with some management with pain ..He listened to me and then said I would benefit having a stimulator .I was not up for no surgery's...But I let him do the trial and it worked so well I didn't want to have it taken out, I have been his patient for 6 to 7 years ...I Can't tell anyone about the pain they don't feel my pain because no one knows what they are experiences until they have to deal with it them selves. There is not a Dr in this world that I trust as much as Dr peters was for me. He made my life tolerable from bed ridden and crying to being able to play with my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren again .To take away this man's career that helped over 300 patient's he helped is not exceptable....They see the small screen in front of them but he sees the whole picture..And this is how they treat him for making so many other's life worth living.|I've been going to Dr Peter's for several years. He's the best pain Dr I've ever been to and I experienced some very terrible ones, that didn't care. Dr Peter's always takes all the time I need to help me. I have chronic back pain. And I don't want surgery, I'm afraid of becoming a cripple. So yes I take pain meds, so I can continue to function and work. I don't want to switch drs and I'm really hoping to try to stay with him. He is honest and truly cares about his pts. Whatever they are doing to him is ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR to him and ESPECIALLY HIS PT's. I'm also a nurse and I've seen what surgery can do to people. Dr Peter's knows this. If I even have to change my meds I still want to stay with him. He's just the best, he's truly saved my life. So I can continue to give excellent pt care to those that need it. I don't abuse my meds, far from it. I'm very conservative with them. Dr Peters, is the best DR, I've ever had PERIOD, not just my pain management but he's better than any Dr Ive ever had. It's a shame they put so many regulations on these drs. He's so kind that he called me personally. He really cares about his pts. And this just sucks. He quickly referred me to another dr, so that I don't have to be without my meds, BUT I DONT WANT ANOTHER DR!! He knows me and I trust him. Please reconsider whatever your doing to him to limit his prescribing abilities. These government bureaucrats need to stay off these Dr's backs!! They went to school for several years to be able to practice medicine, and you've put handcuffs on them like they're criminals!! Just because some people are stupid and abuse their meds shouldn't be blamed on the Dr. Every person makes their own choices and it's not the Dr's fault!!! Especially Dr Peter's!!!|Dr. Peters is a highly skilled and compassionate medical professional who has consistently demonstrated genuine concern for the well-being of each of his patients. Over the past decade, he has provided me with exceptional care and attention. Dr. Peters treats his patients as individuals, not just numbers, and his dedication to their well-being is evident in every interaction. The recent events surrounding Dr. Peters are deeply concerning and have had a devastating impact on everyone involved. My thoughts are with Dr. Peters, his family, and his staff during this difficult time. I firmly believe that Dr. Peters is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the DEA's actions are misguided and unjust. By taking away Dr. Peters' livelihood, the DEA is not only causing emotional turmoil for him and his patients but also depriving the community of a valuable medical resource. I am hopeful that the truth will prevail and that Dr. Peters will be able to continue providing the exceptional care that his patients have come to rely on.

#ShameOnDEA|Dr Peters is easily, the kindest, most caring, compassionate, empathetic Dr I've ever had in my life. He has always made me feel comfortable, validated my concerns, & given me real solutions, never just a bandage & he's never once been condescending or tried to 'pump me up with pills.' In fact, he continues to seek alternatives to treat conditions that other Dr's find too complicated to treat. He has gotten to the root causes of conditions that specialists couldn't, has found real solutions & I am finally in a place where I actually feel like myself again. I wouldn't be here, truly, if not for him. He has saved my life, realizing I had autoimmune disease because he requires his patients to be seen so often to oversee their progress, monitor any medication they're taking & to ensure their safety. His dieting advice when another Dr put me on a GLP-1, not only helped me lose weight, but because of understanding my GI history so well, has kept all side effects at bay. I am so grateful to him! He found a non-narcotic solution to migraines & seizures that have plagued me for decades. I haven't had 1 since he started me on that medicine & my own neurologist couldn't get them under control!
He understands his patients & takes time with them. He never rushes you. He sits with you, listens, let's you ask questions, speaks softly, with you, never at you. I've never heard a cross, hateful or hurtful word come out of his mouth. I never have felt put off or offended by him. I never get nervous, bothered by or feel like I've had to go out of my way to come to my appointments with him (despite the 45 minute drive when traffic moves well) because he makes you feel so at ease. He asks pertinent questions & remembers personal details about your life, things that most people might otherwise find trivial. I often bring my service dog with me. She's gotten older & now has cancer. He knows how her well-being has affected my life & will affect me in the future. And he truly cares. I always leave my appointments feeling like I have had not just a conversation with one of the brightest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, but also an appointment with a Dr who checks up on everything from my chronic pain & the effects of the medication I take, to my ortho/spinal & neuro issues, to fibro & auto-immune disease, & often even a mini-therapy session. I learn more each time I am there because he takes the time to explain things. I've gone in feeling so down & defeated at times from a life that I never dreamed would be my own. 'I did not go to school so that I could be like this,' I often pity myself. But, thank God, this man has given me the ability to get past those emotional hurdles & see that field of hope.
For those of you feeling the need to suddenly give a 1star review, bash & belittle him, his staff & practice (the last one in particular), I emplore you to do your research, (the nightly news does better stories on kitty litter). This man has been targeted for several years & what has happened has nothing to do with money or greed. KY is a big target because of its pill mill reputation. The most disgusting thing here is they've targeted an honest man who isn't a mill, didn't steal, didn't give out meds to his staff or sell cash prescriptions, & who didn't fraud the Medicare/caid system.
I often wonder why he keeps practicing with all the disrespect he receives from patients. I see it in the office & I see it here. But I know its because he cares about his patients. So maybe, before bashing him because 'your mom' can't get 'her' pills, that she's been 'pumped up with,' breathe, think about some of those things, try & imagine what this Dr, his family & staff must be going through, wait for them to help her until he's reinstated (especially since she still has a few days until her next rx is due). Maybe don't bite the hand that feeds? I imagine in the '15 years' that your mom was in his care, you weren't complaining about those meds, especially since you're so upset that her PCP wont give her any now.

The different options are discussed with you thoroughly and they help you find the best option for you. Excellent doctors available for epidurals and blocks performed. Excellent care with a truly caring health care professional.|The Pain Institute is a great place to go for your pain issues.

I proceeded to tell him my condition and I was very understanding that, in my particular situation, getting better or back to where I was probably is just not in the cards. After having several doctor visits, physical therapies, and a MRI this was a last ditch effort to seeing if I could ever be 100% again. I proceeded to ask him several questions because my condition is personal to me and can be debilitating at times. He seemed to be in a bit of a rush and proceeded to make fun of my questions and laugh at them with the nurse, saying ""let me look at my crystal ball."" He then asked if I understood the joke? It was very discouraging to me, as someone just wanting answers for my pain. I can't speak about the clinic itself, but I would not go to this doctor as he was not professional in the least.|I don't do illegal drugs been going there over a year now. All of a sudden I failed a test that they did not notify me of. I got a letter in the mail and if I come on premises they will call the law. Been calling for 2 weeks and no response. I need to know who is top staff there over all of the center. I don't know why they won't call me back with an explanation.  Hanging up on me being snobby. Never have I ever had a problem with them till now. If it was a mistake admit it and give me my appt back this is not fair.|I'm celebrating 10 years of sobriety today.

Most of you know me, but don't know my story...

18 years ago I was in a near fatal car accident. I got put on opioids for the pain, and was addicted within 1 week.
I NEVER bought the opioids off the street, and they were ALL legally doctor prescribed. I was in active opioid addiction for 7.5 years. My pain specialist at that time had me on 10, Lortab 10's a day...

I hit rock bottom, and by Gods grace, I got into a new pain management specialist, Dr. JT Ruxer.

I owe my life to this doctor. Without him, I would be dead by now.

On September 16th, 2014, I decided I was tired of my own shit, and I flushed every single pain pill I had.

I was in withdrawal for 46 days. I did this at home, alone, with my service K9, Minka watching over me.
I'd have to say that these 46 days of withdrawal were the absolute worst, and also the best time in my life.

I learned how incredibly strong I am. I learned to count on my faith in God, and God never failed me.

Today, I am so incredibly proud to say I've made it 10 years sober.

Even though sometimes it's still 1 day at a time, I know that I can do it... 

Please friends, remember, addiction affects everyone, NOT just the addict.|I will never recommend anyone of my friends or family to go to elite pan pain and spine. I know the statistics for African-American and doctors and specially black women that are treated totally different. They'll make you seem like that. Everything is OK and then they'll call you in for pill count which I passed then they'll say oh you had an unsatisfactory urine but you wouldn't tell me that face-to-face. You had to send me a certified letter. I kept telling them that the shots weren't working, we need to try something else but they never listen. They don't take my advice. I found someone else who listens to me. We talk about it. We're gonna try different things and I appreciate that and then what I tell them they don't use against me I like to talk to my doctor and if I can express how I feel because you're gonna cut me off because you think I'm so addictive, but you keep providing me with the medicine  Will never ever recommend anybody to go to elite and spine. Because and one of their PA flunkies is the rudest he walk in don't speak sit down at the computer. Don't ask me anything. I'm sitting there looking at him. He does it make it comfortable for me to talk to him or am I'm supposed to say anything so he goes, you had one little trace of I can't remember what it was but I knew I had been taken TheraFlu and what is the cold medicine NyQuil so he cut me off and was like you have to come every month for a year so I said OK I did the whole year. Urine test were very good , he's rude. I don't know cause I'm black which I'm sure it was cause I don't see too many Black people in there you can talk to Doctor about his PAs. They don't believe you and the patient is always in the wrong.|I have been a patient in pain management care since 2007 and the doctor my general practitioner referred me to was good but Shane Taylor and all the staff at Elite Pain & Spine have introduced me to things that have brought me more relief in a year than my previous provider.

Very comforting and very  compassionate. Listen to your concerns and do their best to achieve the best results for your pain. I have see them a few times and definitely recommend anyone that's in pain to visit and see for themselves|I so wish I could leave negative stars. No stars minus stars. This facility cares nothing about people whatsoever. They're rude inconsiderate they've cost me my job. Because of their incompetence, an incapability of doing their jobs correctly. I could go on for days about how bad my experience has been with this facility and the Doctor.|Got shots and didn't relieve any of my pain. He just keep saying do you have any questions for me. So next visit I went to the Paris office and seen a Lady PA she was very nice and listened to how my pain had not subsided. She proscribed meloxicam and it relieved my pain but the very next follow up I seen Muniswarmy again and he said you're not getting anymore pills (Which was not a narcotic) I said but it's stopped the pain. Never offered anymore treatment but wanted me to make another appointment and I did and soon canceled it.. what a waste of time and money!!|Working to control pain in people is a difficult job; I  have chronic back pain since I was a teenager. I am being  going to see Dr . Vinod Musigwamy since few months a go and he has done a great  job to control my chronic back pain.|Dr. Mumiswamy has been my doctor I want to say 5 years. He has been giving me injections for neck pain and doing the ablation of nerves in my neck which really works. He even saw how I was walking one time and asked if I had back pain, I didn't at the time.  A year went by and I started having back pain. I think he actually predicted me pain before I experienced it. He did a procedure/surgery which completely took away my back pain. If something does not work for you (It happens) they will try something else that will work. Just let them know. I also had an issue in my arm which none of the doctors could figure out. Daniel listened to me and got me in touch with a doctor who instantly solved my problem and did the surgery. I was in chronic pain crying and they have always taken me seriously. All the nurses are really caring as well. I really don't think they get enough compliments for all they do. Thank you. The front office is awesome as well always getting in touch with the correct people.|I received the most excruciating pain of my entire life from the hands of Dr. Maxpain Muniswamy.
The nurses were incredible and sympathetic but
Muniswamy couldn't have cared less about what he did. I needed a lower back injection to relieve the pain of the arthritis in my back. After the procedure I never saw the guy again! I'm not sure if he is just incompetent or just enjoys administering
tortious pain!   After all, it is a pain center.
If you are in need of back pain injections, proceed at your own risk, or go SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!
His reputation must proceed him because I went to a clinic in Lexington and the nurse asked me where I went before coming here and when I told he she replied ""oh yea I've heard of that guy"".|I've been seeing Dr Muniswamy for about 5 years. Nerve blocks and then ablation for my lower back. The first ablation lasted 4 years and recently went back to have it done again last week. I'm free of pain once again. He and his staff are all kind and caring people.|TLDR: Incredible office staff, but careless physician.

My experience with Dr. Muniswamy's staff, especially Nikki & Justice, was phenomenal. They were kind, patient & attentive. However, I cannot say the same for Dr. Muniswamy.

I have experienced chronic migraines for most of my life & they seem to be exacerbated by the fact that I clench my jaw and grind my teeth. I had previously been injected with Botox for migraines, as well as in my masseter muscles for TMJ. When I went to Dr. Muniswamy's office, we talked through these things and scheduled an appointment for injections. When I called to confirm it had been approved by insurance, I was told 200 units had been approved. Given that he had told me standard protocol for migraines was between 100-150 units, I assumed that meant the other 50-100 units would go into my jaw, which seems to be one of the main sources of my tension and migraines.

When I arrived for my appointment, Dr. Muniswamy did not explain the procedure, tell me where he was injecting, or give me any idea what to expect. In less than 10 minutes he had injected across my face, head, neck and shoulders without marking any of his injection sites (I have never received botox without it being mapped out for symmetry). He told me he was finished and I asked about my jaw. He told me he wasn't doing my jaw, and I reminded him of our conversation at my last appointment. He eventually said that he remembered that now (did he not read my chart before coming in or take notes about my pain during my last appointment?), but there wasn't anything he could do because 45 of the Botox units have to be wasted and it would be fraud to inject them elsewhere. I expressed my frustration and told him I felt like this was a waste of $1,000 (he seemed shocked that it cost that much), when the tension in my face/jaw is what drove me to the appointment in the first place. He cared very little about my pain or experience and promptly left the room.

Nikki tried to comfort me and worked hard to make things right, and for that I am grateful. However, as a doctor who is treating patients living with chronic pain, I would expect that they would listen to their patient and collaborate on a treatment plan that best fits their needs, rather than utilizing a ""one size fits all"" treatment. I will not be returning to this office and strongly recommend you seek out a different provider if you are looking for pain management options.",2025-02-26|2025-01-14|2024-03-12|2024-08-14|2022-05-12|2024-05-21|2024-07-18|2023-06-26,5|1|2|5|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJiX43IYFAQogRv0STi_n1VRY,33

His office is very responsive and professional.|Dr. Beacham as well as Ann and Jenny are phenomenal. I've been at this location when it was a previous doctor who owned it. So I've been here through many changes. And I think Dr. Beacham and his nurse practioners are wonderful! Having seen all 3 of the above listed I can state that they all listen to you, help think outisde the box, and truly care! They are not just there for your pain, but to help find the source and treat it, and not just with pills. Having UC and being able to get a procedure to help with that is life changing. They are in a transition,and just like in any other profession it's hard to find a stable work force. They are working hard to find the right office staff to fit their needs and who will stick around.. Good staff is hard to find everywhere right now. I have and will continue to refer Dr. Beacham to anyone who needs help with pain and don't want the tradional medicines prescribed. Because Dr. Beacham is very good at finding procedures and supplements that can help tremendously too!

They put a pain pump in my best friend. And then the pain pump does not work and she keeps calling them. She goes to the ER and they say the pump is not working and they keep doing the same stuff over and over again until she's in so much pain, so she can't even hardly move. This place is ridiculous. They don't follow through. They don't call when they said they're gonna call. I would stay away from this company.  Commonwealth pain clinic is so much better. They have real compassion this place has not.|I don't write a lot of these, but I saw there were some negative comments, so to set the record straight, I have been dealing with chronic pain for 8 years. I spent 6 of them being either undertreated, not treated at all, gaslit, or straight up ignored. I was almost to the point of wanting to die, not because of depression, but because my legs were on fire constantly, I could barely walk, and no one would help. If that was going to be the rest of my life, then it wasn't bearable, nor worth it.

Dr. James was the first doctor to actually listen to me, treat me with respect, and treat the issues. I'm finally to the point where I don't have to be afraid to give an honest assessment of the efficacy of my medication out of fear that they will just decide I'm lying and stop treating me at all. He's very straightforward about treatment options, limitations, and the reasoning behind them, which I appreciate. I don't know where I'd be without this practice, so I would take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.|He performed epidurals in my lower back
It was painful but it did help my back.
Going tomorrow for some neck injections for my spinal stenosis|I really like Dr James and most of his staff. I was there today for my appointment and was very disappointed in the employee that checked me out. She was very rude and acted like she was miserable! I've been a patient for 4+ years and never had this happen before. Maybe she was having a bad day, but if she treats all the patients like she treated me, she needs to find a new job.|This was the best experience I have had in a long time seeing a doctor. The staff was amazing and polite with yes ma'am and no ma'am. Clean office, with pleasant music playing. My wait time was short and I was very nervous. I have had medical chronic pain issues for 2 years with surgeries and no one really listening to me. I met Dr James after my orthopedic and urologist suggested him. He was amazing and listened to everything I said, even joked and laughed with me because I told him how nervous I was. We came up with a plan until I can get a knee replacement in the future, due to my age they want to wait and he is working with both my receding doctors to keep me pain free and healthy. I have had 2 years of horrible visits with other doctors who want nothing more than to take you off meds that work and try other meds or endless injections. I would recommend this group to anyone and nobody was rude or rushed me, I think some reviews are just people not getting a certain way they wanted because you couldn't have asked for a better staff and a more understanding doctor.|There well over a year, seen the actual Dr the first visit ONLY. They called out if the blue while all my grands were here for spring break. I had NO way to get there with 4 kids. Never have they called before, that was the first time. It was completely out of my control. Today I get a letter saying they were discharging me. No warning no real reason and they booted me. They wonder why so many turn to the street for relief, THIS is why. Ive never abused ANY medication..EVER! I've never sold, or given away ANY of my medicatiom and take it exactly as prescribed. I do NO other recreational drugs. They are destroying my quality of life and im absolutely positive they do not care! If I put myself out if this misery i live with 24/7 they would not bat an eye! Shameful practice! Im disabled and can not drive far at all. Me getting there meant waiting for a ride. Thats not possible when everyone is at work and I have 4 small children.|I've been going to this clinic for over 5 years for terminal lupus and other problems. I came home from being at families for Thanksgiving and received a letter in the mail telling me they let me go from the clinic because I missed a meds count. I'm absolutely in shock cause I was never informed that I had an appointment to do a med count, let alone missed it. I've always done everything they've asked of me, never missed appointment, always passed drug test. When I called them to find out what was going on, no one wanted to discuss it, it was just to bad. I know I'll end up in the hospital trying to deal with being taken off meds that quick and it will send my lupus in overdrive! I really don't know where to go from here! Very disappointing!!|I like Dr. James but majority of the staff is rude, mean and unsympathetic. To Edit: had an appointment at 9:30 11/14/23 this morning for an epidural. It's 11 a.m. and no signs of anyone, not even to check on me. 2 hard chairs, my back is hurting. I overheard one of the nurses offer someone a recliner. Excuse me? I'm hurting too!

She told me to disregard, but Wellward  continues to send me the same bills. I have been trying to get a response from their bill collection agency since May, but no luck. Very frustrating.|Overall I can't say I was helped after all. They did a swab for genetic defects but I never got results. They do injections with anesthesia which is as painful as you'd guess! I even tried working in the lab for a bit and saw the machinations in the back. The nicest term I have is disorganized. We were just not a good match.|Everyone there is so kind. . They are intelligent and know exactly how to deal with each patient's needs. I was in so much pain when I first came. I am getting better with each visit. Would recommend Wellward to anyone.|I moved from Louisville to Lexington august 2022. I have been a patient of this facility since. The first 5 months where positive! Testing mostly to target my specific pain points. I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, so there are a lot of pain points in my body. Triggerpoint injections, epidural, injections, nerve block, injections, and acupuncture in my spine and shoulders! My doctors truly cared as they listened to me during all this process of diagnosis. Everything was going great until 2023 January 1 when they changed my doctor and I have seen a different doctor every visit since. I have only had one bad experience where one of the staff complained about my language and I was reprimanded by the office manager, as if I were a child disrupting class in grade school! It was very demeaning. However, after I had complained about this episode, I was given a call at my home from the office manager that had reprimanded me. We actually had a very good conversation where I was able to express my feelings. I feel like the office manager understood me and the other patients a little better after this conversation as I understand them a little better. These are young doctors with new innovative techniques to manage pain. I have nothing negative to say about their process!
I feel like the front staff needs to be a little more diligent. I have been waiting for three weeks for them to call me to set appointments that the doctor had ordered.
All in all, these people are way better than the Louisville clinics by far! The doctors do listen and seem to genuinely care about me as an individual and not just a dollar $ sign! Thank you for that!
The Big Question:"" would I recommend these people to someone with chronic pain?""
Absolutely 100% yes! I have been to several pain management facilities in my past! Let's just say these people run circles around everyone else I have experienced!|On my first appointment I was actually impressed with my interactions with the nurse practitioner that I saw and the doctor that she called in to get his input. On my second appointment they had me see a different doctor and that Doctor who was a psychiatrist was in my opinion an absolute quack, an embarrassment to the profession. The second doctor appeared more interested in arranging for me to have treatments that were astronomically expensive and that even though I had tried those treatments before and they did not work, it appeared irrelevant to the psychiatrist that we would be doing the same procedure I had already had without any benefits. The first visit was great but the second visit made me feel like they were just looking for creative ways to charge my insurance astronomical fees.
I was specifically looking for ketamine infusions and I had more than a dozen medical professionals, psychiatrists giving me a diagnosis that qualified me for the ketamine infusions but wellward seems to be making things more complicated than they needed to be.|As someone who has battled chronic pain for over 25 years and only 45 years old, finding a solution to pain was a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. On top of that I had an accident where I was told it was mandatory to have a lumbar fusion.  I also had bulging discs in my neck and back, a torn meniscus in my left knee and a torn MCL in my right knee...... I know pain.
For those like myself who are weary of the prospect of surgery, Wellward offers a light at the end of the tunnel that you've been praying for. After exhausting everything from Massage, cupping, chiropractor, dry needling, acupuncture, burning nerves, injections, Ice, heat, electricity, and of course patches, creams and anything else you can think of, I had given up on life.
What truly distinguishes Wellward is the doctors. Dr. Danesh and Dr. James are not just MD's. They are like what CSI is to solving crime but they solve your pain problems. I have never had doctors explain to me how anatomy of your whole body and how pain works, giving you multiple options to solve the problem.  They don't just throw pain pills at you or cut you open. In desperation I put my trust in Wellward and got PRP injections in my back and knee. The relief brought tears to my eyes, since it was the first time since my surgery that I felt normal again.  I promise if you find yourself weary of the relentless cycle of pain and apprehensive about undergoing surgery, run to Wellward TODAY!.|Great medical service andcommunication is very good. Highly recommend to anyone.|I can't say enough positive things about this facility! The ladies up front always get my appointment scheduled so fast, and are always so welcoming, kind and attentive!

The latest incompetence of that office was sending me for an MRI when I can't have an MRI. This dr and office just replaced the battery on my simulator. He should have known that I couldn't have this MRI done. No1 told me about the appointment but luckily I got an email 2hrs before I was due to show. The MRI technician said I cannot believe they made this appointment for you knowing that it could cause serious internal Burns in your body and/or try to pull the stimulator leads from your body. When I've been actively voicing my opinion about running out of medicine and it costing me my job to where I made $30 an hour. It started a problem obviously because no one wants to be critiqued and accused of ruining someone's life. Then their latest ignorance was sending me to this MRI appointment to where I could have been seriously seriously injured. The staff at Norton's pain management do not care about their patients, when you voice a complaint, their staff actually laughs at you with the office manager (Ruth) as you're walking out the door. Good luck trying to get and hold of the director for Norton's because they're about as incompetent as the rest of them. What employer is going to believe that a establishment like Norton's would let people run out of their medicine? Instead the employer is going to look at you like you're abusing your medicine. I have Casper reports, drug screens and everything that is on my side. I have done nothing wrong besides voice my opinion and stand up for myself and to try and hold people accountable for their actions.  THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARE BUT I WILL DO MY BEST TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN NOT DO THIS TO ANYONE ELSE. I got dismissed from their practice and had to request a letter, which I received today after trying to call in my medicine to hear from the lady on the phone that I am no longer being seen by Norton's pain management. They don't even care enough to let me know that I've been dismissed by certified letter that is how things are supposed to work as I've heard. I've never gotten kicked out of a pain management place because I do everything by the book|Had a VERY poor experience trying to get a patient scheduled in this office. Spoke with the office manager RUTH who was very rude and aggressive! I spoke very calm and polite with her but she was very argumentative and then hung up me when I tried to get her last name to report this issue. I am beside myself at the idea that someone in your office would be so rude and inconsiderate! I see all the bad reviews for this location and it starts with management. If this is who they have as an office manager then it makes sense why they have so many issues! They probably need a fresh start or re-training at this location. Very unprofessional and just unacceptable to treat people that way.|After waiting in line and in the nasty packed waiting room behind someone arguing over who is responsible for paying for their pain medication with the front desk person for over 35 minutes...then sitting in the run down and dirty exam rooms...my appointment went equally as poor.

I should have just walked out then.

But I was there hoping to see my former pain management doctor after being told they could treat my Arachnoiditis...but instead the appointment was with a NP not the doctor who had treated me for several years prior.
He was my doctor until I refused anymore spinal injections at that time because they were making my pain worse after receiving the dozens that were pushed on me to receive any pain medication from him at all. I told him I didn't want anymore shots because they weren't helping so he said no shots no more meds and that is when I left then. After leaving there I was diagnosed with Arachnoiditis by another doctor in another state. I received 4.5 years of proper care there but my doctor retired leaving me in a tough spot without a pain doctor at all.
But here they quickly reminded exactly why I left this place in the first place. ABSOLUTELY NO HELP or HOPE at all with my Arachnoiditis DX and work related pain but offered to give me more epidurals, a spinal cord stimulator, or a pain pump. All of which I cannot have due to my autoimmune pain disorders...I explained that fully before making the appointment to see if they could even treat me in the first place if they bothered to look it up in their medical journals. I waited 2+ months for this appointment and was also told due to my concurrent psych issues no one would help me at all by the unprofessional Nurse Practitioner. Wonder if they realize if my pain was under control that my depression may not be as big of an issue as it currently is.  As a professional you never say that to a patient especially a severely depressed chronic pain patient.  I didn't ask for pain medication but was treated as a drug seeker wanting to off myself anyway.
I was hoping to try ketamine and or low dose naltrexone for my severe pain and relieve some of my depression at the same time but couldn't even ask before I was given a drug screen which I passed.
No such hope at this place. It is either 60 to 80k for a pump or a stimulator plus maintenance refills or endless $2300+ epidural injections which my body would be further damaged by and or reject the implants or NOTHING.

Go elsewhere these people aren't here to help unless you are willing to put your health at greater risk and possibly end up with what they will say is an untreatable condition that these harmful excessive epidural injections do cause. I am proof.


Update and response to owner:
You already have my current phone number and contact information in my medical file.  I am willing to discuss whatever you want to about my experience and review of your business.|I'm not sure if they are having a staffing issue at this location or if it's something else, but I've had more issues in the last few months than I've ever had with any doctors office before. Mixed up or missing paperwork, appointments that were scheduled weeks in advance only to find out it was rescheduled when I show up, little to no communication at all, and when I give them my info to call me back at their convenience I end up not hearing from them for weeks until I eventually have to call back. I hope they get these issues resolved because this is location is the most convenient for me due to work|When I first started several years ago they were great.  The other day I had to see the nurse practitioner and she was horrible I am having trouble getting my pain medication refilled for the first time.  This is going to force me to go to the er just for some relief.  She was rude and did not listen I am going to talk to my Dr about changing The only one in the front who knows what she is doing is Pam and she is wonderful|Dr Vinayakan and the staff upstairs are incredible. They seem to care and listen and I'd give a 5 even though I've not had any relief. The actual clinic in suite 185 is a very different story. If I could I'd give a negative 5. One of the receptionists was very kind the other jumped all over me for paperwork I was never given or sent. The nurse lacks anything that even remotely resembles empathy or compassion and god forbid you are upset that you've been dealing with the ever increasing pain with no relief in sight.  A patient isn't even allowed to use the restroom. I now have a better understanding as to why people seek help from the streets|Dr. Verghis and Wendy are the best. Thank You both!|My 1st issue:  I give this rating bc of Communication issues with Dr. V's assistant.  I am having a serious situation and have tried to talk with Dr. V directly.  I've only been able to talk to his assistant and what I'm telling her about my situation does not seem to be being shared with him.  I've called 3 days in a row; what is relayed back to me doesn't match up to what I told her.  My last call waa on Friday.  Never heard back from Dr V or from her.  I'm going through a long holiday weekend in serious pain and nothing to do about it.

My 2nd issue is the Progress Notes from my visit 2 weeks ago. I printed off a cooy from My Chart.  There are many very serious errors on these Notes.  I don't know who to talk with to get the corrections made so my appointment information is correct and my history is correct. I think I need to go back and see what the previous appointment Progress Notes look like.

I hope to hear from someone soon so these issues are addressed and corrected.

I had everything faxed that Metro requested. The had told me to self discharge myself from my current pain management clinic before I could become a patient of theirs. After my previous clinic faxed all info to them, Metro faxes a denial to schedule me letter to them. They did not call or email me as for the reason. Not I have to hope my previous clinic will take me. Metro was very disrespectful and unprofessional!!|Dr. Reasor is a phenomenal physician. He always takes his time and so does Jessica, his NP. They answer all your questions and you never feel rushed. I have had numerous injections in my back and hips and will continue to do so with Metro Pain Associates. Thank you for being so professional and kind.|DR Reasor is an excellent physician but his staff is not up to par.  They lost my MRI disk even though I wrote who it needed to go to and who it needed to be returned to.  The staff are also very rude and insensitive to the pain people are in.  Also Since Dr. Reasor is a one man show, getting an appointment in a timely manner is next to impossible so you ended up setting around in pain for months.

1/13/2021 This is an update to my post last February.  There have been some changes at Metro Pain for the better.  Dr Reasor is still a one man show but is an excellent doctor.  His staff have worked to get me in when I needed treatment and Dr Reasor has helped me with additional treatment for injuries I experienced from a motorcycle accident.  His anesthesiologist is outstanding and the scheduler has been extremely helpful in getting my appointments.  Metro Pain is the best in Louisville in my opinion.|Dr. Reasor is AMAZING! He's very funny, excellent bedside manner, listens to every word you say and takes it in account. He's has been treating me with SPG blocks every month for 2 yrs now. I'm so glad God put thus doctor in my path. His team that works with him in the procedure room are amazing as well. They make you feel relaxed and at ease bc I'm a nervous nelly. His NP is also AMAZING! She listens,  dosen't rush and I know she's there for me. A great place with great people. Front desk, Dana is great! All around you could say I love this place and the help I've got from Dr. Reasor.
Bethanie Gitlewski|Dr Reasor has excellent bedside manner.  I have been a Nurse for 25 years and I can't say enough good things about this office and the staff. Everyone is professional.. they don't over book appointments... the wait time is shor .  They are prompt to return calls.  They listen to your concerns and they are very much concerned with helping you feel better.  The nurse practitioners are very knowledgeable and friendly. I never feel rushed or not cared for when I'm there. Always welcoming... concerned and friendly and Dr Reasor has an awesome sense of humor.  I reccomend them 100 percen .  They have helped my pain with fibromyalgia and I'm ever so grateful.. thank you Metro pain|My husband and I were referred to pain management by our family physician. We were very anxious and hesitant because of the horror stories we had been told about it. Dr. Reasor came highly recommended and our physician set us up with him.

Dr. Reasor is a wonderful, caring, and compassionate physician. He eased both of minds about pain management. He discussed a plan of treatment for both of us at great length. He is extremely thorough and we left feeling like we had been listened to, taken seriously, not judged, and happy with the treatment we received from him.

If you have to go to pain management, I would absolutely recommend Dr. Reasor and his staff. It may take a couple of months to get an appointment, but he is well worth the wait.|I'm currently with a pain management doctor who is ""okay"", not great not horrible. Prescribes opioids, persistently wants to ""sell"" you a SCS (spinal cord stimulator) or a Intrathecal Drug Pump. Pretty much like the typical pain management doctor I guess, I am looking for a higher quality, more professional doctor than who I'm currently with. The previous comments are about my CURRENT pain management doctor, I'm not disclosing his name for fear of retaliation. Again the previous is NOT about Dr Reasor.

Dr Gary Reasor initially took about 9 MONTHS to be seen,  after requiring me to send my medical files to him for review to see if I would be approved as a patient.  I did think this was horrible, pain management is a little different than other specialities, people are in pain and suffering and if your primary care doctor is not prescribing opioids you are going to suffer a long time before becoming a patient.  I was though very impressed with Dr reasor, his personality, professionalism, and researching during my time waiting to be seen found he does come quite recommended.|Unbelievable how awesome Dr. Reasor is!!! He truly cares about what you are going through, how you got there & where to go from here to fix it and get you back to the quality of life that you deserve! Praise GOD for doctors like Dr. Reasor, along with his staff. They're unremarkable as well!!!!!!!

While we have tried to accommodate patients who have been displaced by these practices, some patients are inappropriate for opioid management or have a history of abuse, misuse, aberrancy with medications, or physician shopping.  If patients are not able to follow state and federal laws, the practice will not and cannot support such behavior and patients will be discharged.  Patients who have chronic pain and functional limitation are welcomed to the practice for consultation and treatment.  Our goal is to treat patients as we would wish our family to be treated.  Unfortunately, some individuals who are opioid seeking will misrepresent the truth in reviews when they are unable to take accountability for their own poor decision making and misdeeds.   In those cases, we consider a negative review to be a sign that we are fulfilling our responsibility to fight the opioid epidemic.|This is the worst place ever.

Made me feel really comfortable and describing everything diminished my anxiety as had never had a spinal shot like this. I didn't get sedation (my choice) I was a little worried of the pain but it was not near as painful as I expected! It helped he talked to me as he was doing the procedure so I knew what was happening and it took my mind off what was going on! 24 hours on I feel 100% better and no pain ! No reaction from needle puncture. It left the tiniest bruise that has almost faded in 24 hrs. Will definitely go back and recommend too.|Everyone was very helpful and friendly in a place where patients may have some fear. They were thorough and Dr. Zack Klinger explained every step of my procedure as it progressed, making me very comfortable. I will go back to him when my neurologist orders another treatment. And I feel great.|Went in for knee injections and walked out feeling like a million bucks! Got my knee drained in addition to the procedure o went in for.

They had to wait to hear back from the insurance company. I was in so much pain I asked if he could do anything help me relieve the pain. He gave me some numb shots in my back five injections, hoping that it would work I went home and the next day I was worse than I was when I went there on call in the office and asking for some pain medicine until they had my insurance approved. My epidural I was told I can only get muscle relaxers , after pleading with Dr. Klinger that I couldn't stand the pain I have indigestion and I've been eating Advil like crazy. Still refuse to give me anything for pain I'm a 65-year-old male that takes good care of myself I don't do illegal drugs nor do I smoke, but the arrogance of this  doctor to God decided that he didn't wanna do anything for my pain, I have never been treated so badly in my life and at the time of making this review, I'm still trying to seek help from my back pain. I'm currently flat on my back and excruciating pain waiting for my primary care doctor to call me with another referral to go somewhere where they have some compassion , I hate making post but I feel when you put your trust in a doctor to help you that's what they should do. And I'm sure there's many more people like me that just don't post worse experience in my life so sorry my waste of my time going there and not getting any relief , it's unbelievable to me that they can call a pain management|The aides, nurses and doctors are all very nice.

Well done!|I have been seeing Dr. Jackson for a couple of joint issues for several years, I have made much progress with both my neck and my back.

Excellent Doctor and Staff. Consistently provides great medical care and are very good with scheduling appointments and following up when necessary.

They are always very courteous and respectful of individual medical concerns and privacy.

I highly recommend Dr. Jackson, his staff and Commonwealth Pain and Spine.|Dr. Jackson took the time with me to understand what brought me there and what I was experiencing. However I felt that he was judgmental of mental health issues before he walked in the door and sit down with me, although I do understand his concern these issues had nothing to do with why I was referred to him. I would have been more than happy to answer questions, had he asked instead of forming judgement, in regards to being stable for over a decade on that front. All in all he did offer help to get me to my already scheduled surgery date, which I am grateful for. His nurse was much more compassionate and genuinely cared about my problem. She was great making sure I was comfortable. Sadly, I didn't get any information if I had medicine issues from today until my surgery. All in all I didn't expect to need pain management after my surgery and, again, was given pain control meds; could have done without his judgmental idea of me without asking.|I have been going to the practice now for a little over a year. Dr. Jackson is great and all the nurses and others that work with him are too. He is helping me with the pain I am having in back. I would recommend his practice any time.|Everyone was so nice. Dr Jackson took time to talk to me and was informative. He didn't just prescribe a medicine and send me on my way. He wanted to get to the cause of the problem and then treat. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. I would highly recommend Dr Jackson.|I usually give a 5  .
Appointment at 8:10, called back at 8:09.  Everyone was nice and attentive, as always. After I get my shots I usually get to walk out to my driver.  Today was different.   I was told to Sit over there, not knowing why.  I said "" oh I usually just go"".( she may not have heard me ) still don't know why. Thanks for the info.  from there I was just another body. She was not attentive. Didn't leave till 8:38.  Guess  I m spoiled I am usually out 22 to 30 mins. From start to finish.|Had my very first appointment.

We had 9 tx at wellness center. Insurance wouldn't pay for anymore. So went back to pain center. They said they would get an updated MRI   WAITED A MINTH BEVER HEARD ANYTHING. So called pain center again and they said they had not ordered it yet. Went back to pain clinic tin two more weeks. Mark said he would other a MRI. Waited 2 weeks called insurance company. They said they haven't heard anything about a request about a MRI. Called pain clinic at hospital asked to talk to Samantha Goodin  where we started at.  The nurse said she wasn't there and gave me a number to. All her at. Called and left a message. No one called for 2 days. Called that number again and left a message for her to call still didn't hear anything at all so on Friday we call the same number. Nurse said we weren't a patient at that office. I was given that number by the pain clinic to call but she would give her a message to call us. Still no call. As of right now I have nothing good to say except I'm very displeased. I worked at thag hospital for 12 years. And can't believe the service we got. Called my insurance company told them we need someone else. Left my doctor a message and told him to send us somewhere else   Just so aggravating. Waiting and calling since July to try to help my husband get treated fsirly. Talked to pain clinic.

Today is September 4th. I've been calling the Hopkinsville Office, Madisonville Office. No Response. Today ,the September 4th I called Paducah Pain management. They even called all the numbers they have. They couldn't reach anyone. So when are the offices OPEN??|I'm so disappointed of late with no one calling you back and not calling your medication in at all. Causes me to be aggravated because I have to keep calling waiting for 30 minutes and then having no one call you back. I like my doctor but I hate their service. Who in a Drs office stays on the phone that long or never calls you back. My medication keeps me from pulling my hair out so I can live somewhat of a normal life but they just don't care at all. That's the conclusion I make out of it|The Doctors there seem nice. Always in a hurry to get you in and out though. I've knocked down stars because the phone calls leave something to be desired. I've called now a handful of times, it's always over an hr wait time. I've left 2 voicemails, to which they have yet to return my call. This last call was over two hours waiting, just get forced to leave a voicemail because it was their closing time. I'll edit if they ever call back.|Worst pain management ever, I went here for years and have gotten into full blown arguments with the staff, if you can get past the office workers the Drs and , especially, the nurse practitioners are good at what they do. It's the shear laziness of the office staff that will cause u to hate this place. They set your appointments out a little over two months away but the office ladies don't bother themselves with calling or sending a reminder out when that apt is coming up and than if you miss the appointment they act like you are a criminal, than another example of shear laziness is when i contracted COVID, they asked for proof so I emailed it and than they left a voice mail saying ""if it was u that sent the at home COVID test you need to get one from a Dr office, if not disregard this voicemail"" I sent one from a Dr so I disregarded, a few days later Tracy (what they consider a manager I guess) calls with a snide attitude "" Mrs. Brown"" ""we sent you a voicemail and you still haven't sent us a DR note"" ....I had sent one from jenny Stuart for that matter and when I told her this she said ""oh, well we didn't receive it"" no apologies nothing, so I verify the email address even though I have sent stuff to it before and i resend it. Fast forward about a week later I get a letter in the mail kicking me out for missing appointments (even though I never got reminders and always made it within a week or so ) and for not doing pill count (because they never received the Dr note). Now why would they not call me and tell me they didn't get the notification knowing I resent it? These people also treated me like I wasn't in much pain even tho I have over 6 things physically wrong documented and known for causing dehibolitating pain and they have me in loratab 7.5s! The worst part is now that they have done this it looks like I got in trouble in pain management and I am struggling to find a new one and I just got diagnosed with severe canal stenosis after I had been saying for years something is wrong with my back and they throw freaking lidocaine cream at me. If you in anyway can go to the one in Madisonville do yourself a favor and do so to avoid the mess that they call pain management.|Took over 3 weeks for  Dr. Manjikanti to say ""there is nothing I can do fir you."" These pain mgmt docs act like they are god...they're just foreign docs wanting to make bank off of US customers, and have zero compassion.|You can either provide Lisa volburns new pain management with her records or we can just sue you guys!! You kicked her out OVER A NEGATIVE REVIEW THATS 100% HONEST.. looking into the laws, I see that's a form of medical malpractice , and I will be talking to an attorney about this issue and negligence on your end preventing her to get the medical attention she needs.  Try me!! I'm sick of you guys there, it's always something with y'all and it STOPS TODAY.. if you don't care about ppl, then I'll hit you in your pockets and affect you that way.  2aiy and see guys!!!|I've posted for my mom's experience with the Dr Chann.visit. I pray they God I never see her so upset and drive  hour ten min. And be treated like dirt. She had a dr.vist with Chann. Did u listen to her Pain ?? Did u ask her pain level, did you look at her ankle and foot.??  I will be with her the dec. 3 .10 am appointment.  She's not a win insurance number. She's human. I can see what people sometimes self medicate. Ur not doing ur job..... point blank.. it's human being.. not insurance number. So ur paid and yell next... My mother is so upset and shaking crying. Cause she can't get a Dr. To listen and really care about ....pain management... Pain management..  definition of it?? To help manage pain... Listen to ur patient ..and help them like ur supposed to for God sake..|I just visited this clinic less than a week ago.  This is my experience but each person has to make their own decision.   I was sent a grey.booklet that I was to fill out and bring with me to my first appointment.. I had difficulty in answering some of the questions so I called the office.   I explained this to Tracy.   She informed me if I didn't fill it out completely the doctor would NOT see me. (BIG RED FLAG)  When I arrived I handed it to the receptionist.   Tracy looked it over and marked some sections and had the receptionist to bring it out to me to let me know I didn't answer the questions. I told the receptionist I did answer them and removed the yellow sticker to show her but Tracy was not satisfied with how they were done and she brought it back out to me.   Things went down hill quickly.   I snatched the booklet out of her hand.   I didn't mean to do that but I was extremely frustrated by then.   I had already told her numerous times that I did answer the questions but there were a few I simply couldn't answer.   I felt as if she was pressuring me and badgering me to answer the questions despite the fact that I had repeatedly told her I couldn't.   She proceeded to tell me I didn't the doctor would NOT see me.   I saw this as a threat do this or else.   I proceeded to tell her what I thought.   I mentioned the rating and the bad reviews and that she was one of the reasons.   One review complained of staff being rude and she definitely was.   Instead of yelling and arguing with her I should have simply gotten up and walked out.   A patient's treatment should be based on the facts, on an exam and tests if necessary.   It should NEVER be based on guessing which is exactly what she wanted me to do.   If this process of facts, exam and tests are not followed the patient is at risk of not getting the best care as possible and the outcome may not be as good as it could have been.   No patient should ever feel pressured or threatened when seeing a provider.   This type of treatment of a patient is unethical.",2024-09-04|2024-06-20|2024-03-08|2023-09-08|2024-06-12|2024-01-29|2023-11-04|2022-07-04,1|5|3|1|1|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Are they execpting new patients","I am not sure have your primary doctor refer you to them",long_wait_times|pain_management_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJz7NNwV4zZYgR3GzUj6HzkTw,32

Prescribed me pills that I said give me headaches but still prescribed.  Also they have generic drug screening.  He said my meds weren't in system and they were.  I can't recommed this place.|The Dr. I had at the time was a huge disappointment but I don't think he is there now. Very clean. I remember a couple of very kind and attractive nurses that I felt really comfortable around and had the since that they really cared about the patients there. Sometimes the waits were  long other times It went Very fast.  I was there about five years before I had to cut back on all the meds for my own good.  I left a star out for the horrible Dr.|My Dr is Dr. Verghis. He is probably the best one in this office. Although they do run a little behind, it's not bad. He listens and is very understanding and knowledgeable. He doesn't push procedures on you at all. The only downfall of the office is when you have to call in a script. They are either really good about it or terrible. No in between. Sometimes your voicemail seems to get lost I guess. But as Dr.  Verghis goes....he's amazing. Most of the staff is very friendly too. They treat my wife and I like family.|I've been getting Caudal Epidurals from Pain Management for about 7 years. I get them every 4-5 months, So far, I guess I've had about 20. I have NEVER had an issue or bad experience. The Dr's and staff are excellent. Very kind and very professional. James Q. Bilyeu|I have been a patient of Dr. Gudibanda for many years and it has helped tremendously! I am a fan. I am not a ""pill"" person, I go for the procedures which is a better course of therapy. The pills are addictive, and hard on your organs. My advice is to stay off the pills.
Dr. G is very good with the injections, I get them in my SI Joints. They use an X-ray and there is slight sedation. IT WORKS. It does not hurt. It is stressful, cuz needles are involved, but it's not bad.
I have been to many PM Clinics and this is the best. Yes, there is a wait...like all the other places. Yes, the clinic will drug test you if you take opioids but since I do not, I am not required to do that testing. Other clinics insisted and tried to charge me for tests I do not need, it is a cash maker for them...a real racket.
If you are in pain mgt, you are at the last stop...where they send you when there is no where else to go....
I have been so so so lucky to have these physicians and the staff helping me. I have had some bumps in the road with rescheduling too much...I had to realize how important this is in my life and quality of life I have...but it hard to get off work sometimes or get rides after procedures for me....
I also do my PT there at the hospital when needed, they have a professional staff and a large area which I prefer over cramped little places in strip malls.
It os so easy to judge these types of clinics, but they have certain policies for a reason. They deal with loonies on heavy meds who are addicted. It's not easy to care for as many patients as they see a day....
This is the BEST place in Louisville for Pain Mgt, hands down. I owe them so much.|certain staff members are very rude and unprofessional. I started out having Dr.Verghis because of insurance change on my part I had to start seeing Dr.Gudabanda he's very hateful i miss Dr.verghis he is more understanding.Some of the nurse's that work up there act like it's a bother that they have to do something for a patient. It has gotten to the point I am looking for somewhere else to go because I cannot be talked to like that anymore|I have had a great experience with all the staff, nurses and Doctors at Norton Pain management. I only receive injections in my back and do not require any narcotics. They are wonderful people.|I had a spinal fusion in 1998 which was a failed laminectomy. I was able to continue to work 10 more years with the experience and steady hand of Dr Ricky Collis.  He worked miracles with my back.

The doctors are very helpful|I had been with Commonwealth pain for almost 8 years. Dr Walls managed my pain medication.  I ask him personally,  if he did abdominal injections and he said ""no"". His lady assistant said they didn't do them and don't recommend them. I found a Dr in Louisville that did the injections and Dr Walls continued my pain meds. I came in for my appointment and he had his assistant tell me that I am no longer being managed by their group. I responded with the above comments and he said that he would never have said that. The man has the personality of a dead chicken and told her that I stepped on his toes.  So unprofessional to let personal feelings control a patients care. Beware!!!|Everyone there is very friendly and they seem like they wanna help you in any way that they can They have helped me in a lot of ways|Everyone in the office was very professional,
Knowledgeable and friendly.  Dr. Walls explained everything to me in detail, making me feel comfortable. I will be having my procedure done soon.
Thank you Commonwealth Pain and Spine.|I had my first apt today after being with another pain management for the last 7 yrs. The staff was pleasant and helpful. However the Dr. was impolite, couldn't have been more unconcerned, and truthfully acted like a toddler that was pouting and I somehow was taking up his time. I know that many of these pain doctors do deal with patients that are ""drug seeking"" or possibly addicted to many of the pain meds that they prescribe.  But for many of us that have chronic conditions, it is sad that we are made to feel like criminals if god forbid we have to go to an emergency room, and are treated shabbily by doctors or other healthcare professionals because we need pain meds to help us get through a day. I have to deal with that ""stigma"" whenever I have to see a new doctor. One would think that doctors that deal with patients daily would have some idea what many patients have to deal with regarding constant pain. I am fortunate that if I have to I can get by without medication and my pain at this point isn't intolerable.  So that being said, I will not be returning to to Dr Walls.  His obvious disdain for those of us seeking treatment do not need his condescending attitude or his flippant dismissal. I'm just too old to put up with being made to feel as though I was a bother to him.|I always get a reminder of my appointment. The staff are very friendly and helpful with any of my needs. The doctors give all information of me to me. I rarely have a question, unless I want another procedure. Thank you for helping me|My pain was never validated. Was told over and over to go to the ER. No imaging was ever done to determine the cause of my pain. I now see another Dr at a different facility and and MRI was done immediately. Found 2 bulging discs and sciatica.so glad I went with a second opinion. I am now being treated for my pain and feel that I am being heard. Wish my experience could have been different with commonwealth pain.|First visit for me and I was a little apprehension ,after reading the reviews about Dr.Michael Walls ... Let me tell it straight.We should never judge a book by its cover or discriminate against anyone...He is a good Doctor.That being said his staff were very friendly  and Dr Walls listened, an answered all my questions  and set up a plan to help me with severe sciatic nerve pain, tho I'm a very new patient,
I felt very comfortable with Commonwealth Pain and Spine.. I will say if your looking for a Chatty Cathy he is not one of those Doctors.He's a straight to the point kinda of Doctor,

I went in with high expectations, but it quickly became clear that their focus was more on securing payments and pushing memberships than delivering the service I'd paid for. The staff's attention to detail was lacking, to put it mildly. The person operating the spinal decompression table seemed clueless--barely aware of what they were doing and with next to no experience. Even after I pointed out that the machine was misaligned, nothing changed. Then there's the fact that my 20-minute session started four minutes late and ended two minutes early, yet I was still charged the full rate. The office staff couldn't have cared less when I brought it up--no empathy, no effort to make it right. So, after that second session, I walked out, mentally firing them on the spot.|Everyone that I spoke with from the first phone call to the face-to-face visit, they all are so professional and nice.

Sickening to pretend they care for patients when really they want to keep you at least the whole hour and charge for spinal adjustments when I have never been adjusted in that office because I've had 3 neck surgeries so they are scamming insurance companies and there customers because you are not a patient to them!!! My insurance company is being notified of all of these false charges as well! And the proof is in the photos attached if you don't believe me you can see with your own eyes!

Ok I'm almost finished with treatment program and these are my thoughts. The pain in my left shoulder and neck have diffinately improved and that was my goal to achieve.

I am truly grateful for Dr Riley Love|Dr.Love took care of my husband for many years. He was an extremely patient doctor who always made time for us. He even made time just to talk to my husband as his pain increased. Dr Love made sure my husband had options of what medications to use during a certain time so that when he was in a little pain, he could use a less potent drug but when his pain increased he had the option of using a stronger drug. He seemed to know that my husband would never abuse the drugs, so he allowed him to choose the drug that matched his pain level. It was a relief to my husband when Dr Love gave him choices of what medications to use on his own.

After that first visit things went south very quickly. He went thru my history of medicines that I had been on but didn't seem to care about my true medical problems. Dr Grainger had seen that I had been prescribed pain medicine for quite some time and he assumed that I only took the medicine to keep from having withdrawals, so I was completely cut off my needed medication after many many years being prescribed it. He just left me high and dry, no help to get thru the withdrawals from being cut off, no referral, no compassion! I guess it's typical these days for doctors to assume we're all just looking to get high and abuse pain pills. I'm so sick of the stigma from the doctors. I don't want to get high, I only want a little better quality of life without pain. I told my precious doctor that my medicine was no longer helping me for 2 years and he totally ignored me. We do build a tolerance for these pills and they do stop helping us. I could go on and on but I feel like this doctor didn't want to waste his time on me so I'm not wasting my time on him.|He is a very good doctor. He takes his time he's very concerned and as long as you need, he gives you that time he's very caring and compassion.

I don't know if I've ever been treated so badly. My doctor treated me like a criminal. I'm 67 years old and I've never been convicted of any crime.  I've never been arrested for being violent. I would recommend another clinic.|The doctors and staff have always been kind and courteous, my appointments times are within a reasonable wait time. My questions and concerns about my treatments are always answered. And I feel as a patient that I matter..|This is a terrible clinic to go to. I went there for several years and in the beginning they tried to do some procedures to ease my pain but they didn't really help. Then they just quit trying. I have quit going because they changed my Dr 3 different times and the last time the Dr they had me seeing said instead of giving me the option of taking the pain medication when I needed it she insisted I take it all the time. I tried to do as she said and was struggling with controlling my bodily functions. When I told them I wasn't coming back they informed me that my last 4 or 5 drug screens were dirty which was impossible. I am now going to a different clinic and this new Dr says I have arthritis in my lower back and knee so he I'd planning a procedure to try to get me some relief. And he is listening to me that I DON'T  want an excessive amount of pain meds. I do NOT recommend this place at all!|My visits have always been professional. The office ladies are very nice and the nurses assistant are very kind especially Rodney ,who makes my day always cheerful and kind. And my PA mrs.Shockley is  absolutely so helpful and a carrying  physician assistant, and always willing too help me. I am blessed too have a place that all the departments are great here.|I have been a patient at this clinic since 2012;  If they say something I do not understand regarding procedures etc. , I ask questions because that's what they want you to do.   As for waiting times, there have been maybe 2-3 times that I have had an extended wait, but its very rare given the number of people that they see. I live 2 hours away and have no problem traveling to see them because Im not usually there over an hour unless I am having a procedure and they are a little behind.  If I take anything new over the counter I always ask a pharmacist how drug screens will read, and always take packaging so they can see for themselves.  Unfortunately the drug laws are super strict, and it's sad because so many things can cause a false positive.. today most all pain doctors will refuse to see you if you have a dirty test, not just here.  This center has provided me with with more help than I have ever had anywhere else, and I appreciate them all very much!  I have to say though that the only dr. That I did not like was dr. Hummel, and I only saw her once maybe twice butI told them I would not see her again due to her rude treatment.|if I could have given no stars for this office I would have.

I was referred to this office in the Fall of 2017.  I have been on disability due to a car accident since 2009 and had left my prior pain mgmt office due to the way staff treated the patients. I had read the few reviews of this place and it scared me to death but I tried to stay positive that I would be treated professionally.

The amount of paperwork I had to fill out prior to even getting an appointment was beyond ridiculous, they did not make it easy as their forms could not be completed using a smartphone but only a computer, thus I had to use the library to do the forms.

I finally was given an appointment with Dr. Laura Hummel. I waited close to 4 hours in the waiting room. When I was finally called back I was told my RN friend that drove me could not come back with me. I have never heard of a policy like this and my first question is what are they trying to hide? Well it turns out a lot. I was would be refused an exam if my friend went back with me so I had no choice but to go back alone.

They brought me to a room that wasnt even big enough to be an exam room. There was no overheard lights, just a desk lamp and a candle, quite unusual for a practice that treats physical ailments. Next thing I notice was a pretty desk sign that said ""the pain medication you prescribe to a patient rarely gets dispensed to that patient"". I was appalled and knew this was going to be bad.

Dr. Hummel finally came in and I knew immediately that this appointment was a big mistake. She immediately questioned my medications and said I was lying, that my previous doctor would never prescribe those. Funny I had all my bottles with me that stated exactly who wrote the meds, but she didn't bother to look at that. Next she asked why I was there. I told her that I wanted a 2nd opinion, I was tired of being treated poorly and that when I had wanted to get a 2nd opinion the office discharged me. Again she accused me of lying, that she knew of no office that would fire me for wanting a 2nd opinion.

She half heartedly looked at me when I stood and had me walk on my tip toes, that was the extent of the physical exam. She proceeded to tell me that I had 1 leg longer than the other and that was my only problem, nothing Tylenol and warm baths wouldn't fixed. I questioned her than why have I been on disability for so long and why have I gone thru every treatment possible with no results? Who  in their right mind that was faking it would ever subject their body to the intense pain these procedures produce? Not me for sure. I mentioned that I had a lift in my right shoe as I have a shortened Achilles tendon from how I walk due to my hip. She said that's impossible, that's the leg that is longer. I showed it to her and she told me my podiatrist was wrong and I did not have a shortened tendon. She never once even touched my body to examine me and just got ruder by the minute until she came out and accused me of being a pill seeker and then kicked me out of her office.

I have never had anyone in the medical profession ever treat me the way Dr. Hummel did. She actually had me wondering was it all in my head. Thank goodness I came to my senses and did get referred to a different pain management office in Louisville. Funny they immediately diagnosed me with SI chronic pain, which is what my doctors in Michigan had all diagnosed as well. I am now going on my third SI injection this coming week. But oh I forgot, I'm just faking it.

Stay clear of this horrible office, unless you want to be treated like nothing more than a liar and drug addict.|I've been going to pain management for over 10 years.  I've only had 3 in that time period this being the last. They are the worst to all they want to do it stick you with a needle and charge you and your insurance a fortune. I'm a retired coal miner that's busted all up and they've ruined my credit over something I didn't even know I owed. 5 years old and they still hounding me.|The doctor was rude and had a serious lack of empathy. My experience was a nightmare. The building was so trashy like I was in a dope house and the atmosphere was tense and cold. They will not give you time to speak or explain and he seemed to have his mind made up that I was drug shopping or something before he even spoke to me. Said the pain was all in my head and that my surgeon, (a man who Mayo clinic and Cleveland clinic were highly impressed with when I showed them the work he had done on my back if that tells you anything.) pretty much said he was a quack and that the surgery I was getting was because I wanted it not because it was necessary--which is also ridiculous.

Dr Requested for me to have a mri done was told I would receive a call to be scheduled. 2 weeks passed and I wasn't contacted so I called the office to see what was going on and whomever was in charge of putting the referral through didn't which cause me to have to wait an additional week to get an appointment. Yesterday 1/16 was my scheduled appointment again I arrive at a punctual time and was not able to be seen because something wasn't done in office!|After my 3rd stroke Dr Bautista seem me in the hospital and I've been his patient for 3 years now.   Was recently hospitalized for a month when my lungs just stopped breathing.
Sent home with 3 days worth of meds and now this office will not call in my meds or return any of my calls.   I didn't do anything wrong that I'm aware of and haven't since going to this Dr.

Also sent more medication over to the pharmacy which I can't pick up because he hasn't approved that medication either and it's too high for me to afford. Which makes things even better? You can't call anybody in the office cause they don't pick up the phone let alone schedule an appointment because they don't answer either.|Uofl is the worst. I always have problems with their pain management department. To schedule an appointment the line always goes straight to voice-mail. It seems like they are never working. They say they will call me back and never do it. Called the next day told the representative what have she didn't even acknowledge it. She puts me on hold and never comes back on the line. All they do is waste my time.|I'm a cancer patient and was not sure about using pain management but they have been helpful in trying to find the right answer for me.

I always go there explaining how I'm doing and the doctors ask me my opinion of what is working. My goal is to get away from pain meds and that's what we're shooting for.

Everyone there is wonderful.|Very friendly and informative doctor....  Dr Berg explains everything perfectly, and knows how to help with your pain better than anyone I've dealt with so far!    -  Daniel Fabian 2024|I been having back problems for about 6 years now, the place I was dealing with the whole time I had been needing to seek help elsewhere cause I wasn't getting the help I needed there! So I came to THIS doctor and it was NOT good timing when I did, because he was going on Vacation and I NEEDED HELP! So I was forced to go BACK to the place I was trying to leave from the start, so of course I still didn't get the help I was seeking from them so I recently tried going BACK to Berg it's hard to get through their line so in the mist of me trying to go to him again of course I'm trying to find help elsewhere too but I FINALLY got through on his line they knew I would be returning so they let me go through the steps of getting referrals sent to them etc they kept saying they didn't receive the referral so I went to my PCP PICKED UP the referral & the confirmation was attached showing that they sent it over TWICE. I took the referral to Berg's office PERSONALLY lady at the front said I can't be scheduled yet it's been a year since I had been there I would need insurance looked at an etc I'll get a call from someone the next day, next day came I didn't receive a call so I called and called them all day left voicemails like I had been doing since I first started reaching out to this office a YEAR AGO like I said it's hard to get through so i finally got someone on the phone she said,  Oh let me see what she did with your referral! Waited on hold for a second BERG picked up and INSTEAD of him being blunt he said we don't recognize your referral so you can't be scheduled I'm confused atp so I asked what do you mean? BERG'S words, well you came here before &didn't come back (that wasn't a no call no show I CALLED&CANCELLED my far away appointment) you went back to the other place etc there nice people you should go back, he wasn't trying to hear me and what I had to say about WHY I went back to where I wasn't getting help from IDO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN. I was just hoping I could refresh his memory on how it was bad timing because he went on VACATION and had an appointment set for me too far down and I NEEDED HELP! YOU FORCED MY HAND TO GO BACK, THIS WAS not ABOUT YOU! IF I kept trying to get that HELP I WAS MISSING from the OLD PLACE I HAD BEEN GOING TO OR ANOTHER PLACE I wouldn't care because this is my body my pain my life this is a SERIOUS MATTER and CLEARLY I need HELP it says it in black and white on paper work X-rays MRI'S ETC but THIS DOCTOR DIDNT think about that really he think HIMSELF he felt some kind of way because I WENT LOOKING FOR HELP that should NEVER be PERSONAL with a REAL DOCTOR don't RECOMMEND especially since you all had me calling ALOT had a referral sent over brung it MYSELF I'm sure YOU already KNEW you wasn't gonna see me again which is cool but DO NOT waist my time when I could've been looking elsewhere like you KNOW I WILL! His reasoning was STUPID & BS I knew he was full of it when he said you should go back there their good people ME, speechless after that came out of a DOCTOR'S mouth! But that's what landed me in your office from jump cause I didn't want to be there silly! I had been there SIX years and we weren't getting anywhere! But THE GUY sound like a J*rk to me. He's selfish he think about HIMSELF he did that because of his OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS these offices out here are sick it's sad when we're trying to get you to do what your getting and going to get PAID FOR it's not for FREE an it's your JOB too much disrespect an lack of communication etc when it come to these places being trusted with peoples lives! I will say he is the 1st DOCTOR I went through some selfish j*rk ish like that with. I handled myself pretty cool cause usually I'll get back with people like him trying to be half a** smart & SELFISH but I'll leave it in the father's hands cause I know he WILL handle that!! Good luck to ALL dealing with these careless people welp so called doctors out here when it come to your life!|Dr Berg knows his stuff! I was having back pain to the point my leg was going numb.

Don't come here. They are awful and do not care in the slightest about their patients and try to cover the mistakes they make along the way. Stay away. Ridiculous amount of gaslighting. I would rather eat nails than ever return here. Pathetic excuses for providers.|I have NEVER had a bad experience with Dr. Daryl Barnett's office. Dr. Barnett is kind and courteous. He goes out of his way to be helpful and to ensure professionalism in the office. I see Jacque APRN for most of my visits. She takes her time to get to know me as a patient AND as a person. I cannot possibly recommend this caring office ANYMORE than I do! It is marvelous!|Dr Barnett is a great Dr.  Very down to earth; explains conditions and options in a way that can be understood by a non medical person.  He makes you feel comfortable and at easy.  He has always been concerned about me as a whole patient.  I can say the same for Brigid Buckman and Jacqueline Dennis.   Dr and NP's are caring and not judgmental. I am a long time patient and would highly recommend this office if you are dealing with pain.|Dr. Bauer is outstanding doctor she is very caring and will go out of her way to make sure you are taking care of. She is very caring. I have been to another pain management and never had someone to care about me like Dr. Bauer she is awesome!!!|Dr Barnet was great, compassionate and accepted my truth about my pain. I was switched to Brigid who was very judgemental, scolded me for taking too much Tylenol instead of Hydrocodone, go figure! When I was asked my pain level for which it was a 10 that day, I have arthritis and it was raining that day, they said they had to send me to the ER. So I lowered it to a 5 because I just got out of the hospital for a pulmonary embolism & DVT that I had been telling her that I have been feeling faint putting on socks and in the shower. Plus the ER will not do anything for you when you're seeing a pain management Dr. I am very honest with ALL my Dr's, sometimes too honest, but I refuse to allow some jaded APRN to treat me as if I am not worthy of help when my regular MD referred me to them. After speaking to someone after I was told I could not return who goes to the same office about this experience, they also did not like Brigid and was switched to another APRN, they were not told they could not come back. I was told if I can't see everyone in the practice that I would need to find another practice. I found water therapy for which is working great for me, after I found it pain management sent in the referral. I am having tremendous mobility issues for which land therapy would not of worked out for me at this time. Why wouldn't pain management recommend this for me or pay attention to my medical issues when it comes to the pulmonary embolism and DVT??

Usually when I hear stories like this about pain management offices, they eventually get shut down for illegal practices... I will stay with my water therapy because it's working. Most likely I will not subject myself to another pain management Dr to be treated this way. I am not a drug addict, I have passed all drug tests I have been given, I haven't even smoked Marijuana in life. I was just trying to seek management of my pain. Two good things came from this experience, me finding water therapy on my own and getting prescribed a non-narcotic medicine to help with the nerve pain. I highly recommend not going to this pain management center, but if you do, I hope you're not vocal about your treatment and only tell them what they want to hear because then they will tell you that you need to see their shrink if you say tell the truth about anything...|Dr Barnett is a very good and caring person. Aprn Brigid Buckman and Jacqueline Dennis are also very good and caring and non judgemental. I have been a long time patient and have recommended. I did have a couple problems with staff but they have long since been replaced. Never a problem with the Dr.|Referred here by my doctor.  Saw the nurse practitioner not the doctor and was charged a large amount of money to have someone spend only a few minutes with me and just recommend shots.  They also had me provide a urine sample without letting me what the test was for or that insurance would not cover the test.  The front desk staff was also not friendly.  I attempted to dispute the charges but was just told ""that is what Baptist Health charges"".  Baptist Health is overcharging for services.

I work a physical job and just want the edge of my pain to be taken off until I'm able to have surgery. Still no meds (mind you it's just tramadol er not anything super strong like Roxy) and I cannot get them to even return my calls. It's absolutely unprofessional and irritating! I'm about to just be done with this place too! I waited 4months for the appt and for what?! Ughhh|I should have known not to go here. Should have trusted the reviews. I'm a disabled veteran. The VA gave me a referral to go here. I have been waiting for a few months to get in. When I arrived I completed my registration. Was at my appointment on time. Someone comes out to let me know that they can't see me because of 4 documents that weren't filled out. She stated that she could tell I filled them out online but they can't see them. The paperwork would have taken about 5 minutes to complete. Instead they rescheduled me another appointment over 2 months away. I won't be back.|Do not go here for your chronic pain, especially migraine. After suffering for 7 years, I brought my teenage daughter here for Botox. She has had a daily migraine since she was 12. It felt like a factory line, first of all. We saw Cheryl Vinson, APRN, who I quickly realized had no idea what she was doing. Instead of injecting botox where my daughter's pain was, she injected it how she wanted to. We were also seeing headache clinics in Lexington and Chicago so we weren't always able to make the appointments in Paducah but always rescheduled. For that courtesy, my daughter was just dropped as a patient, even though Cheryl has also rescheduled on us twice. I would highly recommend seeing Dr Trimble at Horizons Headache Clinic in Lexington if you or your loved ones have a chronic issue with migraine. Avoid Paducah Pain and Cheryl if you possibly can.|After being on pain management for three years through my orthopedic doctor for severe arthritis and spondylitis, the state insisted that I go through a pain management clinic. We tried to get appointments at several near to where we live.  Mercy Health Pain Management of Paducah was the only one that would work with me in getting an appointment in a reasonable amount of time.  Everyone I talked to prior to the appointment day was very kind and compassionate to my condition.  By the time of my appointment I had been off of pain medicine for six weeks and was dealing with pain that radiated through my lower back, bursitis in my heels and elbows, pain in both knees (the right one especially needs to be replaced, but I am only 49 years old and would rather wait), and arthritis pain in my hands, hips, and shoulders. We had a Walt Disney World vacation booked since January, when I was still on pain management through my orthopedic doctor and we were counting on that to help me get through all the walking that has to be done.  The office staff was very kind and the nurses were wonderful.  Cheryl Vinson, the APRN, is FANTASTIC!  She listened to my symptoms and pain explanations, she examined me to help figure out where the pain was coming from, and formulated a plan to not only treat the pain but to also relieve the symptoms.  I have had an extremely difficult time trying to sleep the past six weeks and have often ended the night with only two or three hours of sleep.  My wonderful wife has had to listen to my complaints and watch helplessly as I struggled to get through the day and to sleep at night.  Ms Vinson was so helpful that my wife burst into tears of gratefulness at the end of the appointment because she knew we had come to the right place and was getting the help that I needed!  I could not be happier being under Cheryl Vinson's care!  They are not going to arbitrarily throw pain medication at you, they are trying to be responsible to their patients and, thus, they need to certifiably diagnose and understand your condition before they offer any medications.  I am content with that.  It helps protect me and helps to protect them as well.  I would give them more stars if I could!  My experience with them has been wonderful so far!|If I could give zero stars I would. I seen Millicent G Kadner, APRN, she was very rude and has zero passion or sympathy for anyone who lives with chronic pain. I waited 6 months for an appointment, drove an hour and waited for almost 2 hours for them to tell me they couldn't help me. I asked why they didn't tell me this over the phone when I made the appointment, she claims she didn't even know why I was there. Then afterwards she puts in my web portal patient notes that I was told before the appointment that they told me that they couldn't treat me when they scheduled me but that was a lie or else I wouldn't have wasted my gas time and energy going up there. I even explained I was willing to try non narcotic options but she said the best she could do was ibuprofen when I know theirs more options than that. I wouldn't recommend a dog to see them for pain. Don't waste any efforts going there, seek treatment somewhere else|Very confused clinic. Would not treat me until Paducah PM would release my pain contract they would not release me. I was no longer on main meds and still refused to see me ???? I was a new patient and on meds the rest of my life for a spine injury. They said I could have 1 pain pill a day is all they'd prescribe. Really? For a spinal cord injury? They got NO med records from my clinics out of state so therefore didn't believe my condition. I had to leave my appointment after wasting 1 hour there to call my old clinic to get records sent to me first. Next appoint was 1 month out. Never seen Dr just NP. All staff was rude and confused|I have seen Cheryl MANY times, as well as my husband and she has been nothing but extremely helpful.

I Lost my Left Kidney,which had a Tumor under it and a Large adrenal Mass above it. The Dr caused a Hernia feeling around with the Kidney. But sent me Home   but I got Covid 19 and had to go straight back and was in ICU for a while. He sent me back home Anthe Hernia Ruptured and Blood started coming out of my Stomach. Which I had ti have Emergency surgery that morning twice because it ruptured again on the say out of Surgery. Then they put some machine with tubes in my stomachfor 3 Months. And I went to a Rehab. Where they had Covid so Bad My Son came from Tennessee and took me out because he'd seen me the Last time with Covid and didn't want me to get itagain. But , I did miss 5 appointments So they Dropped  Me. Because of Contract. It was my Fault for getting sick. So I don't blame Him. I just don't think they told him I called Office and I was in Hospital so many times that year. And Now I can't find a Pain Management Dr. And He was a Great one .

He finally calls me a week and a half later apologizing and saying he has been very busy and was taking time from his lunch break to call me back......needless to say that comment angered me as it probably would anyone in my situation.

What gives him the right to talk down to patients and belittle them? When I called the insurance and let them know how he treated my sister, they reached out to him. After she completed physical therapy, which caused her more harm, and had a reaction to the back injection that landed her in the emergency room, we expected empathy. Instead, they brushed it off and denied any responsibility. When I took my sister to her next appointment, Dr. Davis didn't have the courage to face us, instead having his nurse practitioner handle my sister's appointment. She recommended a different injection and had the nerve to say if we didn't like it, we could leave. No one deserves to be treated like that.

Kudos to her|I sought treatment at this office for a serious work-related injury. I visited multiple times due to a specific referral. However, despite sending detailed and updated documentation several times to the medical providers, they failed to review the information, resulting in the denial of the referred procedure. I made numerous attempts to explain the referral, but was not well received. Notably, when the evaluation summary of that visit was requested, a particular employee, Riley Ann, displayed hostility and juvenile conduct by shouting, stomping away, and using abrasively toned language. Management failed to take any action to address or rectify this behavior, further contributing to an unprofessional environment.|I was getting good care until doctor hajaji was not there and they put some other guy to see me who had a attitude as soon as he walked in the door of the room that I was in. One of the nurses kept telling me. I was lying about my medicine at the pharmacy. And I told her to take herself there and figure it out herself. If she thought I wasn't telling the truth because I had no reason to lie. Come to find out when we were leaving. The nurses up front confirmed that the lady that was calling me a liar was the liar herself.. but whoever the guy was who came into the room that worked with Doctor hajaji Is very unprofessional and we're trying to tell me i was having things going on. That wasn't happening, and when I tried to explain to him what was going on. He wouldn't listen and told me. He was the doctor and he didn't want to hear what I had to say about where I was hurting. My husband and a friend came with me to this appointment because after a month. I'm still in severe pain that has not been taken care of. The rudeness of this Doctor left me crying as I left from my appointment. The rude Doctor also made a comment to me as I was leaving. ""You won't be getting any care and you'll never find out What's going on with you!"" And he made it happen for me to be removed from getting good treatment by his partner.
I was scheduled for an epidural to help my pain. Now I am fighting to find a new Pain management because of a Rude idiot that was trying to convince me that things were going on, That wasn't when I was trying to tell him what was going on. He told me I wasn't a doctor. It's my body and I have x-rays to prove that. I have other things going on. But he was so stupid he didn't even want to look at it or understand what he was looking at. So was the assistant that was taken the notes.. doctor hajjay is very good, but the rest of the people here are very ugly.
I would have given them 5 stars if they actually took me out of pain but they didn't. But I'm stupid because I don't have A phd. behind my name and me, trying to tell them what is going on was pointless.  I was crying because my husband came to ask him. Why were they putting the horse before the cart? And putting me in more pain instead of finding the actual problems. That is when the guy got offended and made the ugly comment that ""You would never find out what's going on and I wouldn't be getting any treatment."" I brought my husband and my friend because maybe they would believe how much pain I was in if they heard it from somebody else since they didn't want to listen to me and what I had to say about my own body. All they want is for you to show up for stupid appointments every week. So that way, they can run through medicaid. Instead of taking care of everything at one time.
They have refused to send my medical records to my new pain management now for 2 weeks. When you call them, they are very rude to you on the phone. And the lady lied instead. She had a call medical record when all your records are handled in house at the office. I had called one of their other locations to find out that information. They are refusing for me to have medical treatment. By withholding my medical records from my new Doctor..
And for the record for the guy who saw me, that wasn't the normal doctor. he would not have been called outside of his name if, he did not threaten me that I would not get the help that I needed or find out what's wrong with me. So before you act like a victim you best think about what your doctor's words were to the patient. He might have a PhD behind his name. But everybody is different and for his lack of knowledge when looking at an X-ray and reading the report. And act like he don't know what's going on. Maybe he shouldn't be a doctor.|Excellent care. I had suffered for over a decade. Pain stole my quality of life. Dr. Hijazi diagnosed the main source of my debilitating back pain.

Being a chronic pain patient for 20 years made me very anxious to find a Dr who could and would continue my treatment and care. I found La Pain Specialist on the web and was given an appointment with dr John Crosby. He was able to view my records and pick up my care immediately. He was so caring and asked about all my health issues. He didn't rush thru the visit and was very thorough. After a visit and a procedure at their surgery center I trust him explicitly to take good care of whatever needs may arise. I highly recommend Dr John Crosby..|I'm a disabled US Army veteran that has been in pain everyday and night for 37-years of my life. Dr. Crosby is the absolute best of the best. He is hands down the finest example of a true professional with a heart of gold. I thank God for Dr. John Crosby. He is the finest, most knowledgeable and compassionate doctor that I have ever witnessed in my 20-years of receiving medical treatment.|Hi there  , I have a great experience during every visit.  His office is very nice, the staff is very friendly.  Dr Crosby is a very compassionate person.  He  listens and he really cares about helping  you manage chronic pain.  I recommend him highly!!!!|Dr Crosby is the nicest, kindest, most patient, most thorough and most understanding doctor I've ever had IN MY LIFE! He truly has my best interest at heart. All the assistants there are polite, patient, accommodating and pleasant, bar none. Thank you so much!|Dr. Crosby and his staff are awesome. Everyone is really nice and listen to what you have to say. Dr. Crosby especially is helpful and understanding. He actually cares and knows what he's doing. Definitely not a pill mill. He addresses the source of the pain.|I was so pleased to find Dr. Crosby. He was so astute to my needs.  Moving from one state to another,  I was fearful that I wouldn't find proper care for my many back problems.  I am blessed to have found this Pain Management Clinic. Dr. Crosby understood the issues and stepped into action promptly.
Thank you so so much.|Dr. Crosby is the best!!!  He is always professional, knowledgeable, not only with pain management, but your health overall.  He genuinely cares about his patients!  He takes his time and does not run you thru like cattle or another dollar.  You are in the best care with Dr. Crosby!|Dr. Crosby and his staff are all very nice and professional.  Dr. Crosby is friendly and makes his patients feel comfortable in his presence.

There are two drawbacks to seeing him.  First, his office is extremely hot and the staff say it's the fault of the door being opened and shut so often.  I've been in similar offices where there was no heat issue when the door was open and shut often.  I think this is something their landlord needs to look into.  Second, the wait after check-in has always been EXTREMELY long.  I have sometimes sat waiting (in very uncomfortable chairs, btw) for 1-1/2 hours to be seen.  When you bring this information to the staff, there are various reasons as to why the wait is so long, but will often say you're next in line and magically I am.  I have gotten to where I wait 20 minutes after my assigned appointment and go to the nurses' station.  I hate complaining, but I'm already in pain, as are most of the rest of the folks sitting in the waiting room.  I wish that were the end of it,  but once the nurse put me in a room, I have waited back there for anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes again.  Summary, LOVE Dr. Crosby and his staff, HATE the wait times in his office.",2024-07-12|2024-01-16|2023-08-25|2023-09-29|2023-09-22|2024-01-30|2023-08-31|2023-09-30,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|4,,,"2 p.m.|10 a.m.|11 a.m.",65|61.666666666666664|61.333333333333336,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ78hphQ-lJoYRmsHn2Z4gNFo,227

Thank you for being such an excellent provider to the area & to the patients!! I not only have been a patient of the practice since July 2016, but I had to move for my job back to Illinois & I DRIVE from here down to Hammond to see Dr. Chad (well, to see the Miranda- PA for my implant refill that's in my back) bimonthly simply because of the care they've given me since I moved back here to Illinois in August of 2017. When I say that Dr. Chad saved my life, those are not words just lightly spoken. He saved me physically but also mentally.

(established patient original from the Northshore area!)|The staff at the front desk are very friendly. The office is clean and comfortable. Nurse Kristen is Awesome. She treats me so special. She knows who I am by name, and she truly listens to me. She knows Me and treats me like a person. She is just Totally Awesome. The Doctors ( Dr Chad,  and Dr. Miranda)  all are absolutely amazing. They both actually make me feel so comfortable and at ease. They listen to me, really listen which is important to me. They show great concern, compassion, and understanding.  No running in and out. But most of all they are the ones that figured out what was causing my pain and treated me correctly for it.
I can say more, but if you are looking for a great Doctor go see Dr Chad Domangue.|The staff is very friendly & helpful. Doctors are caring, knowledgeable, & spend time explaining procedures, etc. With their patients. I personally have made major strides in my recuperating from surgeries & pain with these wonderful Doctor's! Many of my friends have had miraculous healing in taking advantage of the new procedures that are offered. I cannot day enough good things about my care here at Cypress Pointee.|Even the administrative front desk workers are warm and friendly. The nurse returns phone calls within 24 hours. I'm comfortable being seen by any of the nurse practitioners, because they're all extremely responsive and competent. I never feel rushed or ignored.|The office visit was very informative & to the point. I didn't feel like my time was wasted. The nurse is very friendly & outgoing. Gave lots of useful information. Checking & checkout was smooth. I have referred at least 5 patients to the clinic.|Have been with Dr Domangue for 4 years now and love him! He's smart, very driven and overall a great Dr.
He's willing to think outside the box for my situation and always willing to listen to my concerns. My last Dr was just a pill dispensery.
I'm looking for more than that and he's delivered and also respected me when I have not wanted to go to the next step on additional surgeries that I need. Meanwhile treating me with full respect and compassion!
10 stars Doc!|Dr Domangue, M. Johnson, PA, and K. Pierre, Nurse, are the best medical staff anyone could hope for!  Dr Domangue is very thorough in his assessments, research and care of his patients.  He is personable, easy to talk with, and he listens closely to his patients about their health issues. The same can be said about M. Johnson.  She is very attentive to her patients concerns and will go beyond what is expected to ensure she treats her patients with the best and timely care.  K. Pierre is very knowledgeable, caring, and listens carefully to her patients, and communicates effectively with the physicians to ensure the patients receive the care they expect.  I highly recommend this staff for your health care!|Doctor Chad is the best pain management doctor in the state of Louisiana. He has been managing my chronic low back and leg pain going on three years. He offers the very best advice, and a wide variety of treatment options.

Thank you Dr Domangue|Dr. Domangue is a great physician and works with me to help ease my pain. He has helped my husband and myself for many years with injections. After my neck surgery and my husbands back surgery, he has been awesome. His staff are great, especially Miranda and Kristen!  Kristen is wonderful, very knowledgeable, and makes us both feel very comfortable. We both look forward to her professionalism at each appointment. We will both continue to see this physician and his wonderful office assistants!|My wait time is on schedule. I love how my appointment flows smoothly and nice and quiet in waiting room.

Thank you AVALA Pain management  employees for your hard work and dedication to make my visit go as quickly and prompt as possible.  Have a blessed day.|Dr. Chad Domangue is the Most Efficient and Knowledgeable Man i have Ever encountered, He is attentive and doesn't Rush....Avala Pain is the Best thing that I have Ever done. He has Dropped his Patients with No prior Contact or Conversation Nor any Notification or Referral before Doing So... Bad Business!!!! He was still a Phenomenal Doctor!|Dr. Chad was a very important part of chronic pain patients getting help that was so badly needed. For reasons he states he is no longer doing chronic pain management.  This has left many patients in a hard place. More and more doctors are leaving patients without care due to FDA restraints. None of the doctors care to fight for their patients. They pack it in and change what they do. This leaves patients nowhere to turn. Yes, we got referrals to other doctors to turn to but how long before they fold up also. The FDA feels that this will help keep prescriptio n medicines off the street. They evidently haven't done their homework. All this has done is put patients in need of help looking for medication out in the streets buying from the people they are trying to put out of business making things worse not better. I wish Dr. Domangue and other pain management doctors would fight for their patients as hard as they do for their money.|Usually have great experience with Dr. Chad and Miranda. This last week has been a nightmare of an experience with the office staff. From the ones that DONT answer the phones to those that work on prior authorizations. I have called a week working to get a PA completed. Received ONE call back a couple days ago was told by a very nice lady she told me I could call her back at ext 105. One morning I actually lucked out and a call was answered. To be told she wouldn't ring ext 105 without me going through the entire story again. While speaking to the girl at Ext 105 she did tell me the PA was approved said she looked at it again the next day when I finally did get her call back. She said she saw it yesterday and looked again to make sure and yes approved. Wrong answer again. Wasn't approved. We are now in the appeal stage because the insurance didn't receive enough information to approve.  Called again today to see if the insurance had called them and to followup. Again no answer ALL DAY left a message asking PLEASE PLEASE for a call back well now 4:40pm again no call back again. Very disappointing!!|Dr. Chad is seriously, the BEST & COOLEST guy ever!! To top it off, his staff is just as awesome! I have been so nervous for years to talk about what has personally worked best for me to treat my pain & to not feel like I'm being judged considering I'm in my 20s, but when I saw Dr. Chad for the first time this week-- I knew he would be the doctor to finally help me & make me feel comfortable enough to talk about my pain & what works for me. This is the start of a new beginning for me-- to finally enjoy life & not sit in bed or on the couch all day, almost everyday--in a dark place mentally because of my pain constantly getting in the way anytime I try to do anything fun & get out the house. I am so glad I chose Dr. Chad, and excited to have him along side of me for the rest of my life to be my doctor to treat my pain. I cannot even put into words how happy I am to finally find something that works & helps manage my chronic pain. I have laid in bed so many sleepless nights due to pain, and me worrying/crying silently because I have missed so much of my kids life due to my pain and never being able to get out and enjoy life with them. But after years of just dealing with it & almost giving up... I FINALLY I am getting the treatment I need & that works for me! It's like a huge load off my shoulders.

I went through multiple doctors, physical therapy and opioids as part of my treatment.

That is until I found Dr. Firas Hijazi.  He was the first one who actually listened to me and informed me of non narcotic alternatives.   I now live with less pain overall but more importantly am not constantly living in a fog because of taking opioids as the means of control.

I still have pain, as the injections wear off and the nerves grow back.  But in the months between procedures I have more of a life.  Able to drive without the fear of being a hazard to others or getting a dui.

I highly recommend Dr. Firas Hijazi.
I also recommend trying the injections and RFA as an alternative treatment option.

Thank you to the Staff as well.
I've been to all the offices and Alliance Surgery Center and consistently received professional, yet friendly service.

I am going on around 10 years of treatment with Dr. Firas Hijazi.

I also have lower spinal issues not shown in picture/diagram.|Friendly,knowledgeable, caring staff offering on time appointments with easy scheduling. Love Dr Hizaji and his staff. Highly recommend.|This is literally one of those places that's only interested in making money and they will treat you like cattle and they will force you to take injections because that's where they make their money even if they don't help and they don't care if they're dangerous or painful. And also notice that they will not even let you take a family member with you because they're so scared of getting sued because of how terrible they treat their patients I've actually seen them hide reviews so you've been warned if they mistreat you immediately see a lawyer|The staff is always helpful and polite. The doctors are very helpful and have various options for treatment!|Dr. Homra has been amazing! I recently had my first procedure in his Metairie office and the experience was very pleasant. He took his time and explained everything he was doing step by step throughout the entire process. My pain has gotten significantly better since I've started treatment with him.
His entire staff is so caring and polite. The young lady at the front desk is so kind as well as the lady in the procedure room. They definitely know their stuff!|I love Dr Hijazi and his staff!!

I was finally sent for an MRI 3 months ago. I have arthritis and spinal stenosis in L4 and L5.  I'm 40 years old, I have a job that requires me to be in my car 8 hours a day and sitting causes the worst pain and I'm too young to feel this bad physically!! I feel like no one has been listening. My orthopedic doctor took months to accomplish anything then sends me here to get meds when I've specifically said that's not what I want.

On my first visit with Dr. Gordon I was talked to with respect about numerous options that could help me. I felt like he was hearing me not just trying to get to the next patient. Within 4 hours I had a call back for an appointment to receive nerve blockers. My orthopedic doctor would take months then say it was the insurance company. Dr. Gordon assured me that this process would be quick so I could receive more lasting relief not just pain medication. Also the staff were personable and efficient! I'm so grateful I found Louisiana Pain Care and I look forward to getting my life back!|What's worse than zero stars because I have to give one to review yet I'd give them whatever the worst shape is and only highlight one of them.

Worst possible place to take yourself or a loved one who has chronic pain. Literally pushed me to constantly get injections then after a hundred not working and one their beach houses paid off. I was told through imaging that it's not bad and I'm making a bigger deal about it that I should. Went literally weeks later to a neurologist and he literally told me that last guy is a complete idiot and I had a piece of disc that fractured off my L4-L3 bulge pulled out of my spinal cord and the rest of that one shaved down.
They were completely aware of my family history of back issue and I literally have the same name as my father. So giving me naproxen after I come piss in cups and do countless expensive and painful injections, then completely missing that is absolutely unacceptable. I'm so glad I finally got in with the other guy but I still need 4 more done and they obviously missed those as well.  Literally sell your soul to whatever evil bad guy you believe before going here. I've lost years of my life, money, and my mental health because these people didn't help me the way they should have.|I've been seeing Dr. Forte for months now and he and his staff have been wonderful to me.  I've also had two procedures at the surgery center and everyone there has been so nice, caring and helpful.  I'm so thankful to have found these people to help me at such a tough time in my life.  Blessings to them all.|La pain care and staff are truly awesome people. They go above and beyond to make sure that you are well taken care of. I would like to recognize Dr. Henry Gordon and Teresa Kennon for their hospitality and kindness shown each visit.|I've been seeing Dr John Ledbetter and his staff for almost 3 years. He and his staff are exceptional and they truly listen and care about their patients. My lower back is kept in check by the care I receive from these people. I wouldn't know what to do without them. More people that's getting quality service from them like I do should leave a 5 star review. They deserve that!!|I was seen there for a few months maybe a little longer.  Each time I had a co-pay of $30. I had a couple of no shows due to my not having the $30.  I was on a pain medication that allowed me to function.  Earlier this year I decided to try a friend's alternate pain management method.  It didn't work so today I went back to them to resume my medication regimen. I didn't always take my pain meds because I didn't always need them.  If I had extra at the end of the month I flushed them. I took a drug screen for a company while on them and they didn't show up. So apparently they didn't show up at LA pain care urine test either. So I saw a fast talking NP today that reviewed my history and asked me what I wanted. I simply said to have my pain care handled by LA pain care. She left to go talk to the Doctor and next thing I know a nurse is handing me a discharge sheet with recommendations on it that we're never discussed with me.  Apparently I'm supposed to live with the worsening neuropathy pain the rest of my life.  I really feel like I was just dismissed as a pill seeker and nothing was seriously discussed with me by the Doctor. Very unhappy, frustrated, and hurt by my treatment today.|I've been coming since the first of the year, I see a lot of reviews that are absolutely BS. I can only speak of Dr Forte, He is by far the best of the best, not a doubt in my mind , he is definitely on top of what I'm going through, I feel pretty sure all the bad reviews I've read, I'm pretty sure y'all are the problem, It truly has nothing to do with this clinic nor any Doctor, or nurse practitioner, cause the are all very passionate and caring as anyone could ever be.|These doctors are wonderful and very humane. Went there for 17 years, had to move cross country and the doctors are not humane here. They make you scream during procedures.

Then after a procedure, at the hospital before leaving, I spoke to his nurse there to see if since this would cause more pain than normal and it was almost time for me to refill my meds if he could write for a couple extra pills. The nurse said yes to just call the office.  The office staff was extremely rude and refused to give him the message. So I reported it to the joke of an office manager. That procedure was treatment for one of multiple injuries. My other injuries I'm seeing a neurosurgeon and will be having surgery in the near future, so I wrote a letter saying that at that point in time, I was no longer in need of treatment. I even got a letter that says to go back if needed. Well, my neurosurgeon said I should go back here to pain management until surgery. I called today to try and make an appointment only to have the office manager tell me that I had an issue with some staff, so it was in my best interest to go elsewhere. When I asked if that was her ""polite "" way of saying I'm not welcome, she hung up on me. Stear far, far away from here, if you are in need of help due to pain. They will treat you like trash and not care or help you. If you do become a patient, don't disagree with the staff. If so, you will end up in my shoes. Treated like trash and unsure of what to do|My first visit was with Dr. Robertson in November of 2023 and things went well. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis and was having severe lower back pain. We scheduled an injection and everything was great. Each visit thereafter has been with his medical assistant.

My most recent visit was on 10/16/2024, again I saw his MA. It was determined we would schedule another injection. I was told clearance from my primary care was needed as I would need to be off one of my medications. Two weeks passed, there wasn't any follow up so I called the office. I was told they had a change in personnel and the way scheduling was being done. I was told to f/u in a week. Upon me following up I was told my doctor had not returned the necessary form and it had been sent twice. I found that odd because my doctor and her staff are very quick to respond to requests. Typically a response is received within 2-3 business days. When speaking with my primary care on or around 11/13 she confirmed the document had been completed and returned to your office and provided me with a copy.

As of today's date, 12/06/2024, Lisa from your office still has not followed up with me. Therefore, a call has been placed to pay the small balance, under $8, and to obtain information on obtaining my records to move to a different doctor stating I was not happy with your office. I was not asked what my issue was, the person simply cold transferred me to someone whose voice mail picked up. I called back and received the rudest person ever. I was explaining to her that I'm unhappy with your office because it's been almost 2 months since my visit and still no follow up from anyone regarding the scheduling of my injection. The person stated perhaps they were waiting on clearance from my doctor. I informed the document had been sent since last month and that I have a copy. She asked if I brought a copy to them to which I stated I did not as it isn't my job to do so. This person stated, ""look I'm not going to argue with you. I'll take your payment"". Before she could say anything more, I advised no, you will not take my payment because I'm not going to pay it!

What I thought was my solution to Ochsner turned out to be a nightmare!|As a 23 year old with a debilitating chronic illness, Dr. Segura was my FOURTH pain management doctor as I had been turned away by 3 previous ones who refused to give me anything for my pain, even after seeing that I am hospitalized constantly for this issue. I rely on pain mediations to be able to function daily. Dr. Segura listened to me and took me very seriously. He is such a kind man and I am so lucky to have found him. He speaks to you like you're an old friend. I highly recommend seeing him for pain management.|Amazing team and Dr. Segura is amazing. A doctor who CARES about his patients and not just making money off of my pain. I thank God for Dr. Segura|I've been seeing Dr Segura since January of this year, I was with clinic in Metairie for over 6 years and for some reason they decided to discharge me. I guess they figured that they made almost 1/4 million dollars from me. I'm glad that I was able to find a dr on the Northshore and Dr Segura and his staff care about each patient. He's asked me a few times about having the radio frequency ablation but I don't like the idea of having sharp items near my spine because my issues are at C5-C6 so if anything was to go wrong I wouldn't be able to feed myself. I also like that they give 2 month appointments so I don't have to come to Covington every month, but sometimes when they do the e-scripts it might be dated for the weekend and my pharmacy isn't open on weekends. Which I wish the pharmacy was open at least 1/2 a day on Saturday, that way I wouldn't be out of medicine the whole weekend.|Went to Dr. Segura in the West Bank office when he was just starting out.  He was seemed to really care about my well-being and I really liked him.  Something happened in that office because he was the only pain doctor and the others were orthopedics.  He told me he was moving to the North shore.  I followed him to his new office and things took a turn for the worse.  His NP called me at work and said I had until 4pm to bring my prescriptions in.  I left work at noon and drove an hour to his office.  There were no patients waiting but the NP made me wait 2 hours to count my pills.  When I complained about the wait to her she got an attitude with me and said I could go somewhere else if I didn't like it.  Two weeks later I got a letter from them stating that I had Cocaine in my last drug test and was discharged immediately.  What a coincidence?  I wrote to Dr. Segura explaining what happened but never heard from him again.|Hands down Dr Robertson is the best. Dr. Robertson sat down and listen to what I was dealing with and then gives me his straight to the point advice. When I came to Dr. Robertson I was all the way messed up I had a back surgery that went wrong I was down and out and thinking I wasn't ever going to get better because another Doctor had butchered me up but Dr. Robertson and his amazing nurses assured me that they were going to do everything they could to help get me better are. Dr. Robertson nurses listen and they do everything they can to help you out in a timely manner. So I can honestly say that Dr. Robertson is the best doctor in this great state and his nurses make him a better doctor. And that's hard to find a doctor that listens and actually cares about you getting better and a doctor that has great nurses that back them up and picks up the slack for their doctor.|Doctors seem like they're good, but other staff is bad at following up and scheduling, never got my procedures done thanks to them.

Life is so much better with the pain level at an acceptable level.|Dr. Jolly is a great doctor who really tries his best to help you with your pain that you are dealing with. I've been seeing him for a few years and he tried to help me with different options with my back issues.He hasn't given up and we both finally found the right option to cure my pain that I was having.He is a very personable doctor and I would recommend him to anyone that has any type of problems with their back,neck,or any kind of nerve pain.|Dr. Jolly and his staff are top notch!  Super responsive and Dr. Jolly is an amazing practitioner.  Will definitely recommend to anyone struggling with chronic pain.|The new staff here are very rude.  Need the old staff back because they resolved problems quickly, were nice & handled professionally. Some problems I have experienced
1) An error of theirs, like wrong Dr. Code on prescription so pharmacy cannot fill, took an entire week to correct & that is the pharmacy calling everyday & myself as well. All that needed to be done is send in a new script, same meds with correct code.
2) They scheduled me on wrong day & called the day before to set up another appt & was without meds for at least 1 1/2 weeks to a month at times.
3) To change a script that is same medication, because on back order, ex. need 1-10mg instead of 2-5mg dosage which of course = 10mg, is going to take 1 1/2 weeks, because have to be seen. Let the doctor hear this & I bet he will change that script in a heart beat, without needing to see me.
4) One time, staff in back, told another patient & I to sit in waiting room for paper scripts, for the receptionist to ask an hour later, can she help us. We tell her, we are waiting on prescriptions & then she goes in back & they tell her, the prescriptions were sent to pharmacy. Now why they never come, to tell us, once they changed the plan to send them to pharmacy.
4) Doctor is good, takes care of pain, with meds & injections, just he is only in bi-weekly & new staff say, have to wait until next week when he comes in office. That is not true, because old staff never did tell me that & had any issue resolved within 2 days.  Most of time the same day.
So for these reasons I do not recommend unless they start piecing the puzzle pieces together to get better resolutions for patients beside making them wait so long, plus they need to change their attitudes. Too many doctors out there to deal with the attitudes and wait times.|Dr Jolly is so personable and compassionate. Highly skilled physician. Great care great nurses!|I am always impressed when I visit Dr. Jolly's office. They are very kind, and they listen.|It's real great I like it does a good job|My review would've had a higher rating but I don't know Dr. Jolly that well. I had an appointment with him years ago. I received injections in both knees. He was great and seemed very caring. I really liked him but I couldn't go back because my insurance was no longer accepted. I was told I could only see Dr. Kaufman. I discovered he has horrible bedside manners!! I cried when I left his office and suffered lots of pain over the years because I didn't want to go back to him. Finally, I was sent to Dr. Davis and he's much better! He has given me injections in my knees, hips and I had a Radiofrequency Ablation in my back. Unfortunately, it only relieved my pain for a month. Still hopeful that he will keep trying to find other ways to ease my pain and improve my quality of life!",2024-07-26|2024-12-04|2024-09-27|2024-07-29|2024-08-21|2024-05-21|2025-02-18|2023-05-21,5|5|5|1|5|5|5|3,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,surgery_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|pain_management_services|board_certified_physicians|short_wait_times|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|convenient_clinic_location|medication_management|injection_treatments|on_site_pharmacy|advanced_treatment_options|telemedicine_available|online_appointment_booking|free_parking|wheelchair_accessible_facility|insurance_accepted|flexible_payment_options|cash_credit_payments_accepted|comfortable_waiting_area,,,,,,,,,,ChIJPb4RfNyxIIYRxJYj36NJbl0,106

I originally decided to go to pain management to try to hold off as long as possible on having to get my 2nd knee replacement due to work constraints and length of healing time off of work. As well as having left upper arm pain that wakes me up nightly along with various other conditions. The 1st visit went fine. I met Dr. Davis explained the situation. I was prescribed the lowest dose of meds 2 daily. That was fine with me. Unfortunately a couple weeks later I took a bad fall. My next visit after the fall was with the NP and I asked her ""do you think I need an mri?"" She said ""no I don't think so"". She goes to confer with the real doctor and comes back in with yes you need a cervical mri (upper spine) when the majority of my pain was now severe left buttock pain since the fall and still left knee pain. I got a knee injection was given the same low dose of meds 2 a day and was sent on my way. So I did the mri and upper X-rays. The mri showed herniations and disc bulges in my diagnostic portal. I advised in their portal that I wanted to see the DR for the results visit. Upon arrival I AGAIN am met with the NP. So she of her own admission says they messed up and should've ordered a full mri. Which means another lower mri co-pay ($90) and lower X-rays and states she wants to check my tailbone. I have heard many people discussing fracturing or breaking their tailbone and the severe pain and it can take up to over a year to fully heal. Ok. But...my tailbone does not hurt. Feel free to cover your bases after you've already dropped the ball. So I can't sleep at night due to the left arm pain worsening since the fall and now can't work at my desk all day without severe left buttock pain. She again leaves me on the lowest dose of meds 2 a day. I now still have to choose what parts of the 24 hrs in a day I want to endure the most pain and take Tylenol the rest of the time. Dr. Davis would have known that IF I actually got to see HIM. Maybe he did know and chose not to care. I pay for private health insurance every month out of my own pocket to see a DR. I am not a ""drug seeker"" but turned to pain management out of desperation to have some type of quality of life. However I never dreamed as a 55 year old woman with osteoarthritis, a prosthetic disc in my neck, neuropathy, fibromyalgia and a host of other various ailments that a Dr. would just let his patient stay in constant pain like this daily and not even actually SEE HIS patient. I get it's more $ for him to have a NP see patients while he sees his chosen patients and does procedures and after all it is all about $ in this world. But it should also be about ETHICS and OATHS taken by doctors to treat their patients properly and not allow them to be in this type of constant pain daily. I will never understand how a Dr. can sleep at night practicing in that manner.|Miss Lauren was very thoughtful and thorough during my office visit.  She treated me  in a very professional manner and listened carefully to all of my questions and concerns.  She was truly FIRST CLASS because overall she treated me as a human being, not a number.  VERY SATISFIED!!  Thank you Lauren.  Sincerely,. CORTLAND WILLIAM KING WALSH|Terrible experience. Doctor Bryant didn't introduce herself, didn't ask my name, didn't ask how my pain was, did a cursory exam, dictated when I could get my medication filled (I had already been out for a few days, which means I am going through a rather painful withdrawal right now), and sent me on my way. I had seen Dr. Jolly for another condition about a decade ago and he was a joy to work with. I don't know what's happened, but they now seem more interested in ""moving the meat"" than taking time to get to know their new patients. I made a big mistake switching PM physicians. I would suggest people try LA Pain Doctors, at least they take the time out to do full exams and treat you like a human.|I had the Best experience at this office they offer complementary snacks,water,tea soda.The staff is wonderful.

Add to that fun much of it was repetitive. Then I was called back over 2 hours late! I was the only person in the waiting room. My input on treatment for issues I have had for years was ignored. When I refused to consider the injections they wanted to start immediately they were appalled and unhappy. Never mind I have had a number of specialists I have seen for years tell me to not do them.

Then I'm told the NP wanted labs. When I asked what and why that upset them more. I'm a retired nurse, I take no order without questioning it. Almost a month later and I still have no clue on the results. Imaging was supposed to be ordered and I had to call back a week later to see if it was sent anywhere. The nurse actually acted like I was clueless and it was my fault the hospital didn't have the paperwork. Of course they wouldn't give me the orders to hand carry for some reason. Needless to say my association with this clinic is one and done.|Wonderful staff! Mimi and Dr Ponder are the best! I'm living pain free thanks to them. I recommend them highly!|I had my first appointment here today. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so kind (I am not any easy person right now) and attentive.

I will be forever grateful for his professionalism and his excellent care.|I have only seen Dr. Gordon once very briefly. Each subsequent appointment has been with a PA. The structure of the Pain Clinic is such that you must visit once per month (paying your deductible each time) so that they can simply prescribe more meds. In addition to the random drug testing (which in my opinion is only a means to keep authorities from raiding or at a minimum auditing the facility), there is little help offered beyond more services that bring in more money (such as steroid shots by the clinic next door, also owned by the doctors). When I expressed a desire to seek a second opinion from a surgeon, I wasn't discouraged, but it was presented as a last resort with a lot of downside and not much promise of relief. Not sure I would recommend them for someone interested in getting to solutions at the source of the issue rather than simply masking it with pain killers.|Always professional.friendlyand definitely address why you're here and how they can help.

No nonsense straight forward doctor. Procedure was fast with minimal pain. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Make sure your provider sends over all your MRI/X RAY'S and other supporting docs with the referral. Experience may vary they worked with me very fast after I explained my time line for my child's surgery and a school I have coming up. I was referred here from Fort Johnson. Good luck!|I have been with Dr. Brewer for years. I did my best to comply with the Rules and Regulations, for the most part I have complied. Beginning about 6 months ago I started being treated as a hostile patient. First, they said my urine test came back positive for fentanyl; which I do not have access to. I had medical procedure s done that may have used that. I couldn't give a urine sample at the snap of a finger so I was made to sit there for four hours drinking water nonstop where I ended up going to the dr. Because I about drowned myself due to having gastric bypass my stomach couldn't hold that. They swabbed my mouth, low and behold it came back fine.

This is the icing on the cake. My daddy is in Hospice and I was with my family. I get a call. We need you to come in for a pill count. I explained my situation. We don't care, you need to be here by 5pm or your prescriptions and appointments will be cancelled. Needless to say, I did not leave my Daddy's side. You do what need to do and my Attorney can handle the rest with the harassment charges along with the charges with what my body may endure by shutting me down immediately. I am a heart patient and this is not good. But Melissa and Carrie Anne, y'all have a blessed day because I'm still with my family and daddy.

I don't need to speak with you Dr. Brewer. Your office lacks empathy. For my daddy to be with Hospice about to pass and Melissa and Carrie Anne demand me to be there or get kicked out enough.  Again, my attorney will handle their harassment. I hope this happens to them in the near future. Have a great day!|Dr Brewer and his staff went above and beyond today during the week of February 15, 2021 ice storm.  They worked all day getting medicine called in and succeeded in getting my husbands called in despite pharmacy closures and electricity outages.  The answering service, Dr Brewer and especially Ms. Nicole, were patient and compassionate, even though I had to call 3 times due to not being able to find an open pharmacy that had his medication.

I'm grateful.  Thank you guys so much for what y'all do|Ive had a great experience with Dr. Brewer & His Staff of PA & Nurses.
I've been treat with respect & some with pain that needed to be controlled & after 5 back surgeries later, Dr
Brewer is doing this well. Working with me in the process of managing the pain. Which by the way get a little out of control sometimes. But Dr. Brewer is always on top of it!
Would highly recommend Dr. Brewer & His Staff of professional!!|Very unprofessional! Waited 2 hours before doctor came in! Then he asked if something was wrong, I asked why my appointment was 2 hours prior and he is just now coming in? Then I stated that if I'm 15 mins late you charge a no show. He decided to reschedule! Mind you I was not loud or rude to this man! He is not above any of us and my time is just as valuable as his.
In response to owner comment, the nurse took 5 mins|Fantastic first visit! Staff was very professional,  yet friendly.

Dr. Brewer offered several options  to go to for medications. I found him very caring towards me, the patient.

I will definitely be going back to Dr Brewer. Thank you, Dr Brewer, for giving me some hope in managing my pain in the future.|Dr. Brewer is the most arrogant, uncompassionate man I ever met. From the 1st visit to the last he not once garnered my trust. Therefore anything asked by him weren't answered. If he had spoken to me compassionately I would have answered. I was even asked no less than 3 times by him and his nurse why I used a wheelchair!! Excuse me Brewer for getting in my condition by incompetent surgeons. I also was made to wait in exam room for an hour and a half with no apology or explanation.|I've been his patient (pain management for MS related issues) for over 4 years, and when he divided his practice and opened a new location, I transferred as well. He is thorough and with all injection procedures, I have had as good or better outcomes than I have had with any other doctor.

Hands done the best doctor I've ever been to.  His office staff are caring and dedicated. He truly cares about his patients.|I've been a patient at this clinic for around 6 months, and I can say with confidence that Dr. E and his staff are by far and away the best pain management team in the state of Louisiana. I've been to more than my fair share of doctors from many disciplines, and pain management is easily the most difficult one in which to find quality doctors. The staff at Accurate Clinic is beyond reproach. They treat their patients with compassion, and express a true desire to make their patient's lives better. From the receptionists to the support staff, the nurses, the PA, all the way to the doctor, they are the best team around and it's not even close.

I can't begin to express the gratitude and respect I have for Dr. E himself. He actually spends time with his patients to ensure they are on the best possible treatment plan possible. He coordinates care with my rather extensive team of doctors. He truly listens to his patients and and isn't dismissive of their thoughts, ideas, questions, etc. He's basically exactly how every doctor should be, but unfortunately very few actually are.

There simply aren't enough stars to demonstrate how exemplary this office and it's staff are, and the gratitude I have for their absolute desire to improve the quality of life of their patients.|Ms.Amanda is absolutely EXCELLENT! She goes over and beyond to make sure that you are taken care of! She is very compassionate, caring, outgoing, and truly makes you feel special as a person not just a patient! She is very encouraging and overall more than a 5 star rating!!

Dr.Ehlenberger is a TOP NOTCH physician! He is very kind and thorough! He makes sure he educates you on so many medical topics that it almost feels like a class room! If it wouldn't be for him accepting me as a patient I don't know where I'd be today. It's truly worth the drive!|My husband and I are very pleased with this clinic.  Dr. Ehlenberger is very informative and takes the time to explain things in a way that a person can understand them.  He and his staff are very courteous and kind.  We are being treated for pain and have been helped greatly.  I would definitely recommend this clinic to my friends or anyone who is in need of medical attention.  They have a very informative website which lets you know all the services they provide be it from Massage Therapy, General Practice to Urgent Care needs and much more.|Dr E has been my primary care MD for many years. He takes a lot of time to get to know his patients and utilizes many modern cutting edge principles to promote health and wellness. He is always working on new ways to better his practice and it shows. I would highly recommend this clinic for simple health maintenance and more complex lifestyle coaching.|Doctor Ehlenberger takes his time with his patients and shows compassionate concern.  He goes above and beyond to explain medication and treatment options.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.
A well deserved five star rating.|Waited 5 hours and 30 minutes to finally get ready to see dr EllenBurger. They took my clean urine and claimed there was as a problem with it. I explained that I had to pick up my sick 5 month old child and asked if I can reschedule due to the long wait. They refused me (but told me if I can wait again and use the restroom again that I can see the doctor) I had to leave to get my child so they still charged me 75 dollars for a visit I never had. I can't wait to get my results in for my clean urine that they so called had a problem with. I also waited two months to finally get into this doctor and it has been hell to say the least. If you can get in with Dr. Anseman at my old clinic I would do so any day before accessing this office. The front desk along with the wait time here is unreal. Only a fool would wait that long every month just to get a refill on their pain medication. God bless.!|Dr. E is thorough, incredibly studied, and very empathetic.  My experience as his patient has been superior.  My case has been very complex and far from easy to treat, but Dr. E has showed extreme patience and diligence in helping me find solutions to remedy my pain.  ""One size does NOT fit all,"" and Dr. Ehlenberger tailors his treatment plans specifically to me.  I have been battling chronic pain since 2003 and to date, I haven't received better care by a physician and his staff than I am receiving right now under Dr. E's management.  He takes a comprehensive approach and looks at your entire biological picture to help the patient understand his/her condition and how I can work with him to improve my condition.  Dr. E is constantly educating himself with new research, and incorporating that knowledge into his practice.  If you are having any issues with pain/pain management, I would look no further.

I can confidently say, he is very proactive and truly listens when I tell him about my extreme back pain and how it's affecting my quality of life, instead of being reactive, which is what other pain doctors have done since my injury. Mine is a complicated case due to a spinal fusion with a lot of hardware in my lumbar spine, but he finds ways around it when doing my procedures and has given me back a semi normal quality of life, that I never thought I was going to have again. His office staff are just as wonderful and caring as he is, you will not find a more caring, compassionate, and competent pain management doctor in the southeast Louisiana region. I highly recommend anyone that is need of pain intervention to go see Dr Faust.|I saw Dr Faust recently for a back pain episode, I was very impressed with the approach he took during my appointment. Dr Faust was very attentive and gave me suggestions to treat my pain at home. He made me feel very comfortable and I will only see Dr Faust for any future pain management.|I would definitely recommend Dr. Faust for pain management.  He is thorough in his exam and listens to what you have to say about your pain issues and will discuss options available for your circumstances.  My recent treatment has proven to be very effective.

His staff is wonderfully helpful.|Everyone is so nice at his office.  He is very thorough with everything.  Has a great bed side manner.  You don't feel rushed or just another number.  He takes his time and listens to everything you have to say.|Dr. Faust is the best interventional pain doctor I've been to. The reason my back was so vulnerable was due to my job as a dentist - having to sit for a prolonged period of time - and my poor posture during work. Dr. Faust's recommended procedures, allowed me to live and work ""pain free"".
Thank you for everything, sincerely..|The staff is friendly, caring, and supportive  Dr.Faust is all of those things, also, but most importantly, he is extremely skilled.

I won't change doctors unless Dr. Graham retires and/or moved. and he's too young to retire and I really really hope he doesn't move. He couldn't  be replaced as a doctor In my opinion. I don't wanna have to change doctors.
Thank you, Dr. Graham and Steve. Y'all have always been amazing to me.
Sincerely,
Yolinda Ratliff|Dr Graham came into the room introduced himself and greeted me with a smile. He informed of my diagnosis and gave me a thorough explanation of my treatment options and asked me what I wanted to do. He told me he don't recommend surgery which took a lot of pressure off of me. I really appreciate his concern an experience in his position. Thanks.|Dr Graham is by far the best pain management Doctor. His staff is awesome!! Dr. Graham takes his time to listen to you, and he won't give up until he can get you through the day without pain. I am glad I found him.|Love Dr Graham and his attention to detail. He listens carefully and shows the utmost care and concern. The best part is that he doesn't just try to throw medication at me like others have done in the past, but finds other ways to help eliminate or dramatically reduce my pain. He truly wants to help his patients live life better not just mask the pain. So grateful to have this man and his staff be a part of my care team!|Dr. Graham listened to my concerns about my back and leg pain and thoroughly answered all my questions. He gave me more attention in one visit than what I've gotten from previous doctors I've seen in nearly a year. I thank God for the recommendation from my cousin Angela who is a current patient. His bedside manner and genuine concern was refreshing and reassuring. I look forward to getting better with his help!

I thought he was the best doctor I had ever met. That is before I met Dr. John Crosby. I have now been in treatment for 20-years for my horrible arthritic disease. Simply put, Dr. John Crosby is by far the best pain management doctor on this planet. Time and time again Dr. Crosby has stepped up to help this veteran. If any of you out there are veterans you know how horrible the VA claim process is... Yet, Dr. Crosby has never denied me the very best care he could offer and as much help as he could provide me in my 7.5 year battle with the VA. At every turn he has been there for me as I'm sure he is for ALL his patients. Dr. Crosby has changed my life for the better. I have no idea how I can return the favor. But I do know how I can help others. And that's by getting the word out about a doctor above all the rest. Oh, and Dr. Crosby is just as good of a man as he is a Doctor. My life has been and will always be PAIN infused. At least, I have the very best doctor I could have ever imagined. Thank you Dr. Crosby for being you and for making my life a little easier.

I love Dr Crosby staff and my nurse practitioner|Dr Crosby is without a doubt a well educated physician, his experience is definitely documented in a clear and precise manner.
He listens to his patient's concerns and addresses them in a caring way.
I found Dr Crosby to be a gentle man with extremely great knowledge in his field of medicine.
I look forward to the epidural he is going to  administer to my upper back to treat a four year long acute pain from shingles,!|Dr. Crosby and his team are wonderful. He really cares about his patients. I had a really bad surgical experience recently, and I told Dr. Crosby and Casey, his PA everything that I've been going through. They took the time to listen to me, address all of my concerns, and took over the complete management of my post surgical care. I have improved and am getting better day by day because of their care, and I really appreciate them. I've been a patient of his for a couple of years now, and from my very first visit i knew i had found the right doctor for me, and I was pleased because he spent an hour with me talking to me, did a complete exam, and we came up with a plan of care that included physical therapy, medication, an MRI, and what worked for me. I'm a registered nurse and I had two serious injuries to my neck and my lower back years before at work, and I have a couple of other very painful chronic conditions, and Dr. Crosby didn't treat me like I was a drug seeker or like I didn't have the well documented conditions that I have. Instead he took the time to get to know me, really listen to me, and included me in my plan of care. I had been to several other doctors who just dismissed me and treated me like I was crazy, and wanted to just give me drugs which is not what I wanted or needed, and did me no good at all. Dr. Crosby and his team have never treated me that way which I really appreciate. They always take the time to make sure that I'm doing OK, and that my current treatment is working well for me. With this recent issue, I had severe pain and suffering including multiple infections caused by the hospital staff, and my surgeon did nothing about it. Dr. Crosby took over my post surgical pain management care after I explained everything to him, and I'm so thankful for that because when you don't have proper pain management after a major surgery, and i had two mismanaged surgeries at the same time, you can't heal properly which he and his team understands. I can't say enough how thankful I am for them. Without their help and the intervention of my primary care physician I would not be in a good place. I'm healing comfortably now and my pain is under control thanks to them. I give them 10 stars, and I highly recommend Dr. Crosby to everyone!|I wish I had more time to chat with him very knowledgeable man my last visit my wife learned a lot! About inflammation!!!
He told her to look up the Whole30 diet!
She's not big or anything it's just a better way of eating!

I asked for Jello shots..Valium doesn't relax me much..hahaha. I went in with a pain level of 6 and limping...Dr. Noles administered the shots..and Hallelujah...I walked out pain free and no limping..I pray that it will last a long time...I returned to work on February 1st.

Highly recommend!|My husband was referred by 2 doctors to see Dr. Jake Trahan and the doctor will not take him on as a new patient.  Why?  They won't give us an explanation.  My husband has suffered from Peripheral Neuropathy for 22 years and it has progressively gotten worse.  All the doctors that have seen him over the years said there was nothing they could do for him, so he was given opioids to take.  Our doctor that was managing my husband's pain all these years retired in Dec. 2023 and we were left with a list of doctors to call.  Either the doctors are not taking new patients, or they don't prescribe pain medicines.  We were not told that Dr. Trahan is not taking new patients.  We were told that he would NOT see my husband as a patient. This is a PAIN MANAGEMENT FACILITY.  Please explain to me how this doctor can so easily turn us away without even letting us have an appointment??  I watch my husband writhe in pain everyday, to the point he just wishes he was dead.  It's a shame that a person in this much pain cannot get an appointment at a PAIN MANAGEMENT FACILITY.  The medical system has failed us terribly.|Dr. Trahan has helped change my life. When I met him, he was confident and had a plan. He showed compassion and empathy for my condition. He has done an epidural and two nerve ablations, which have reduced my back pain significantly without pain medication of any kind.|Would like to thank Dr Jake and his staff. His PA was great and easy to talk with. Dr. Jake is wonderful , easy to talk with and takes care of pain quickly! He is very careful to identify the nerves causing the pain . Then quickly takes care of those nerves. Very nice guy weather you see him in Crowley or Baton Rouge.
I have been pain free for over 2 months.|I have only been seeing Dr. Jake Trahan for a month and he has already figured out and eliminated the terrible pain I have had in my leg for almost four years. He has totally amazed me because he has done something for me that other doctors didn't or couldn't do. I absolutely recommend him 100%. I just want to tell Dr. Trahan ""Thank You So Much"".

Years of not being able to function because she's too high on pain pills. Years of me having to answer my children's questions of ""what's wrong with maw maw?"" Years of watching her slowly fade away and and not be able to stay awake through a whole conversation.  Years of watching her endanger herself.  Years of watching her count pills to make sure she has just enough left to pass that drug screen. It's an addiction and Dr. Patel graciously hands out pills like candy to patients to keep them coming back.

Update:  My mother passed away the morning of Christmas Eve 2023.  She had been on Hospice since early November.  Note to others who may be addicted to the high amounts of pain meds this doctor prescribes to you.....  you will be in tremendous pain in your last days here on earth.  Our Hospice organization was astonished at the amount of morphine and fentanyl patches they were having to administer to her to help alleviate some of the pain.  December 23rd, we were having to roll her to clean her.  At that point she was mostly sleeping and barely speaking.  She would scream out in pain.

This was the case as well through her various surgeries.  Ankle surgery, hip surgery, open heart surgery, partial lung removal.  She suffered in pain because unfortunately there is only so much pain medication they can give you before it affects your blood pressure and other various medical conditions.  Therefore, she suffered.  She would cry out to me in pain wanting me to do something for her and there was nothing I could do. She would continuously ask the nurses to please give her more pain medication, but they couldn't.

Secondly All he really cares about doing is sticking you with needles everywhere there is pain never wants to talk abt how the pain medication is not helping. Tells me don't talk or mention the medication like he's afraid of being recorded or smth. Just says well I'll inject a lot more in that area.  Not to mention it's causing me to gain weight. When I asked to not be injected he told me he can't give pain medication without being injected. And the fact that you hv to pay Cash for your urine test. Blows my mind. Why can't my insurance cover the urine test? I'm really disappointed and feeling like he doesn't care abt his patience and what they have to say. In fact when I first came there I didn't have any nerve pain in my legs only pain in my mid and lower back.  but from the first time he gave me shots in my back I start having nerve pain now in both legs and now my Knees now at age 40 I fall sometimes while walking and exercising.|The lady Theresa that works at his office is very rude and doesn't obviously like her job.

Theresa is super nice no matter how rude  patients get,but she will tell you what you need to hear not what you want too. as far as the meds go he wants you to get healthy  and no fault can be found there. if he feels you are only there to get meds to run and sell or get a fix he will boot your butt out on the street.  sad thing is most will never know his nice side since all they want is pills. my daughter even likes him and she watches the shots every month he  hits me with and she does  not like people who hurt me or give shots period,but she is more welcome than me  lol!|Great doctor who actually cares about the root of your pain. All of the negative reviews are from people who are just looking for a handout. Dr. Gupta doesn't play games and doesn't write prescriptions just because you want them.

I love Dr. Guirguis.  His has given  great advise and gets me into other great physicians care. He always gives me temporary relief from excruciating pain .  I do have a few pain free and painless days after every visit.   However, the  steriod injections has made me pre diabetic. No one in my entire immediate family has diabetes. And,  I have gained more than 25 pounds. The  medication ( pill form) only gives me a few hours of pain relief. . I was an Investor, contractor,  builder,  Line dancer ,certified teacher, tutor and world traveler before this pain.  My health has totally deteriorated from pain . Now, I am sedentary and unable to take care my simplest daily needs.  My life has totally ended from uncontrollable excruciating pain.

My husband injured his back over a weekend.  Dr. Martin and his PA were amazing, he went from barely able to walk on a Sunday to back to work on Wednesday.  Can't say enough about the treatment he received.|I see Dr. Martin for low back and elbow pain. I tried my best describing the pain in my elbow but didn't think I was making much sense. When I tell you this man injected my elbow RIGHT ON THE MONEY. I went back a month later for my other elbow injection. I now have zero pain in both elbows!!! All 5 doctors are a God send to the Lafayette area. They are so incredibly sweet and very willing to help make their pain patients as comfortable as possible.|I did not end up in need of such services by choice.  My Lafayette-based Marine Corps unit was deployed on a combat mission overseas where I was wounded by enemy fire, leaving me permanently injured, and dependent on medical treatment, hardware, and/or medication to manage the effects of such injuries.

As anyone who has experienced severe long-term pain will tell you, if not properly managed, it will take over every aspect of your daily life.  What was simple before is demanding, and what was straightforward before is now complicated.  To blunt the mental and physical effects of the pain, I devote time daily to stay strong and limber, to eat right and not put extra weight on the injured limbs and joints, to maintain a rest and sleep schedule, to maintain a support group for when the pain is overbearing.  Anything I can do to rely less on medical treatment is a daily priority for me, but some treatment is still required, and is necessary to maintaining a demanding full-time professional career and social schedule.

Recently, I had a refill due at APC Pharmacy.  My home is a couple of hours North of Lafayette.  Upon arrival, the lead pharmacist notified me that the medication would no longer be filled by APC Pharmacy, ""because I also have a home and pay a portion of my taxes in Texas.""  Although she was prepared to deny the refill, she did not have the written prescriptions required to fill the medications elsewhere.  Should a patient call the nurse's station and request a written prescription, the first thing you're told is to expect up to a 10-day wait, so after doing everything I could to advance my cause, I returned home without the prescriptions.

From the time the refill was due, to the time it was filled elsewhere, nine days passed.  For a person experiencing severe physical pain, whether acute or chronic, neuropathic or nociceptive, one day without treatment is the longest day of their life.  I believe anyone has the right to deny business, whether their reason is right or wrong, but to not consider the patient's basic needs (written scripts) upon denial, leading to consecutive days without treatment, is not caring for the patient's health.  It's careless, it's not healthcare, and it's not professional.

In my case, one careless 'healthcare professional' was responsible for a week of physical agony, a week of unscheduled ""vacation"" days with my Engineering Firm, a week of zero sleep, a week with little to eat, a week of no exercise, two round-trips to Lafayette, and a daily reliving of the injuries that required me to depend on healthcare treatment in the first place.  Each day was long, and it's not something I plan to experience again.  I leave this review not to convince future patients to not choose, or to choose to be treated here.  In fairness, the majority of the administration, techs, nurses, and doctors in the office and pharmacy are 5-star individuals.  But I leave this review here regardless, because something like this should never occur, yet it occured to me here, and therefore, it could occur to anyone else that chooses to be treated here, and especially anyone else that chooses to fill their prescriptions at the attached pharmacy here, and if I were considering treatment here, I would want to know about such instances, so I could make an informed decision.|I can't  be more displeased at this time. I had an appointment with them but during the Christmas holidays I forgot to call. I made it there to my appointment drove all the way from Alexandria to Lafayette for nothing. They know I got 2 bulging disk in my back just did  epidural injections on my back prior to all this and let me leave there with no script.  I talked to Christine told her I was coming days before that she didn't bother to tell not to come if I didn't call within  a 10 day supply time.

To add insult to injury they gave me another appointment only to call cancel that one and told me they can't see me til sometime in February and I can't get mrds from another doctor cause it would void my contract.  To me that is malpractice.  I am in pain and very upset with them and the VA for allowing this to happen to me a War Time vet.|According to my wife's doctor she needs pain management because of the new legislation passed for prescribing pain meds .

I've got a Spinal Stenosis diagnosis about 2 months ago but have been suffering with my back since 2005.
The staff here at Dr Billiodeaux's, made you feel welcome and important  from the very beginning. Dr Seth himself was very thorough , in depth and knowledgeable.  I received my first injection yesterday and all I can say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
It was fast. I hurt a couple hours afterwards but the medicine fi ally hit where it needed and I've FINALLY  had the best nights sleep I've had since 2005. In my personal opinion,  Dr Seth and staff are the BEST in the business anywhere!
Thank you for giving me back some quality of life you guys. I'm looking forward to my next appointment and HIGHLY  recommend you all to any and everyone suffering from their ailments whom want relief and life back.
Simply amazing!|The staff are all friendly and warm, made me feel comfortable right away. I have 3 disc's in my L's that are all sitting low and are on my nerves.  My second appointment I went in for my injection. It was so fast, I was home within a half hour. The NP is amazing, Dr. Billideaux is very good at what he does. I am grateful for them all. I am pain free and have a follow-up appointment already scheduled. Absolutely 5 out of 5 stars!|I have been seeing Dr. Billiodeaux for years on and off. I have never had any issues getting in to appointments, getting answers to questions. He is by far one of the top doctors I've had the privilege of being worked on by. Kudos to his staff for what they do. I get a lot of people get agitated they don't see him directly even going through VA but his staff is amazing and he does stay informed. Everyone needs to keep in mind he's very sought after for work and to be seen by him. I gotta say he's has an amazing bed side manner and always is there if requested to talk to. I recommend him to all my friends and fellow VA patients for work. Good job Doc keep it up and to his stuff you all are killing it keep up the amazing work also.|My visits was to have injections in my back/neck with Dr. Billodeaux. The front desk associates were wonderful at all times. The last two injections was absolutely horrific for me. Both times of the injection as Dr. was administering them It felt like electric bolts going through my arms and head as my arm came off table. So scary the Dr. said whoa and i told him that scared me. Long story short Dr. and his assistant both times was cold with no emotion. I had to get off table no help with my arms feeling so painful. Never will I ever recommend him nor his assistant. The Nurse Practitioner was so caring and thoughtful.
0 rating for my experience.|I am a veteran finally got a community care appointment after 3 window visits. Brought MRI results with me 2 buldging disc 3 pinched nerves excruciating pain and they set me an appointment for August 28th  32 days later
The VA send us to private doctors to be seen expeditiously in this they failed. Dr Billideau did not see me on my initial visit all reviews that say he did is a lie and fake. You won't see him until time of procedure|As nurses, both my wife and I have worked with many physicians. My wife recently had a MRI performed and the results showed several disk that was causing her severe pain in her neck and and shoulders. We researched the various pain management physicians in the Lafayette and surrounding area that could suggest the best treatment without going directly to surgery. We found Dr. Seth Billiodeaux at MEMORIAL MEDICAL GROUP INTERVENTIONAL SPINE AND NEUROSURGERY in Lake Charles.  My wife set up an appointment and he treated her with the Steroid Injections. The pain started subsiding within a few hours of the injection. By the afternoon of the same day, her mobility improved greatly and the pain was now very manageable. The next morning she was pain free. She seen Dr. Billiodeaux twice for the same issue. The first injection kept her out of pain for close to 5 weeks. Of course each patient will experience different results. However, 5 weeks pain free is quite extraordinary and she is very pleased.  What we like about Dr. Billiodeaux was his thoroughness, positive attitude and sincerity in caring for her. We drove from Lafayette to Lake Charles. In view of the results, the drive was well worth it.  His staff was simply great. We highly recommend him for pain management based on the positive results. If you are experiencing back or neck pain, I truly believe a visit with Dr. Billiodeaux will be well worth your time. Thank you Dr. Billiodeaux, seeing my wife free from pain not only made her life better but mine as well. You are simply one of the best and we can not thank you enough.|Dr Leger sent an urgent request for Michael hales for upadural and a shot in his neck where the pinched nerve is. Lady put me on hold and said they did not receive it. Dr sent it to you again yesterday. Lady this morning said mame we have a lot of referrals and it will take awhile. Call back in a couple days!!!  Husband in excruciating pain so now we are in the ear here at memorial emergency .

My husband did get to see Dr Keller. He was awesome. He explained everything in detail and answered all questions.

As I said earlier, your staff at the window do not appear to have any empathy for the major pain my husband is in.

Filled out paperwork, paid the co pay and when finished my husband brought back the paperwork to the desk. I asked him where was the receipt for payment, and he had left it with the paper he turned in. When asked for the receipt, she stated she had shredded it!!!  Shred a receipt   She did print another one, but I've never heard of anyone shredding a receipt.

I was extremely tired as I had been bringing my mom to her dr appointments and my husband all week and was exhausted. So while waiting I put my head on my hand staring into space,
I just happened to have my head facing the reception window,  they looked at one another, opened the window and they both said , do you need something , not real nice like I was staring at them.

To me they are young yuppie young ladies and we were treated as if we did not matter. Again the have no empathy for excruciating pain as they probably have not had pain like that.

Just to be clear, not the doctors in any way. The window staff could be more attentive to patients pain.

Talked with the nurse with Dr Leger and they sent the request on Monday and Tuesday and again Wednesday. I wonder what happened to the first two.

Anyway, I am very thankful that you are taking care of my husband. Right now all he can do is lay in bed so it does not hurt. Still waiting for appt for mri as he has an appointment to see you again on Tuesday. I'm sure they will call Monday.

Thank you again for caring for my husband and understanding the pain.

We saw dr  Keller last Thursday. He was to order an mri and made an appointment for Tuesday which is tomorrow. I called the mri and they have no records on my husband and she said when she did get it it would take two weeks.

My husband is almost out of pain medicine. We cut them into fourths to make it last. He cannot go without pain medication for two more weeks. The only relief is lying down.

If you can't do anything we are going back to emergency and someone is going to help my husband.

Called your office again and they are waiting on the insurance to approve the shots. The mri will come later. Thank you Jesus.

Thank you
Michael and Kathleen Hales.|Dr. Billiodeaux takes time to talk to his patients, consider options, and provide excellent care.

I highly recommend Dr. Lonseth and his office.|Dr Lonseth has excellent bed side manner. He is very professional and shows compassion.  Edward goes above and beyond. Marquita always has a smile and makes sure the job gets done. You can depend on her to follow through on every task. Tyler is very friendly and always acknowledges the patient by name|Excellent doctor and well organized, professional office. Had epidural injection and trigger point shots with him. Highly recommend him.|I am a 75 yo physician fairly new to Nola . I left my medical connections back In Orlando .
I was trained ""old school"".
I had a wonderful experience with Dr Lonseth and his entire staff.
He was warm, professional , knowledgeable and extremely helpful. His willingness to help me as a patient exemplifies what all doctors should do for their patients .
His staff was great from the minute I walked in the office.
He was highly recommended to me and I can only hope that this evaluation will help others with pain reach out to Dr Lonseth.
Sincerely,

Dr Campisi|I was a patient of Longseth Interventional Pain Centers until 1/20/23. I had an appointment for a tele-health call to fill prescriptions. The last telehealth call had an associate of Longseth confer with me. She accused me of lying about dates of scripts to be filled and not taking my meds as perscribed. She also did not fill migraine script. When I asked her for a small increase for 1 of my scripts her statement was ""they will not do that."" Who is they? She did not even speak or even ask the OWNER of the clinic for increase. This happened 12/22/22.
The God complex and arrogance of Dr. Longseths'associates knows no bounds. She got my re-fill date incorrect and accused me of not taking my meds as perscribed because of incorrect refill date.
This morning as we had a heated discussion. Another associate whose name he said is ""Montry"" not only threatened me to not fill scripts but also released me from a clinic that is not his. The black female associate that accused me of lying excuse was, ""we all make mistakes including you."" This deflection of truth is typical of office associates that open thier mouth before confering with Dr. Longseth. One of the members of clinic has now accused me of racist comment due to a description of an associate whose name I do not know. Beware of this clinic. They assume far too much. As well as disrespecting me first. I do not take threats lightly. Longseth has, of course, taken his staffs side without speaking to the patient, me. This exposes they care about themselves and not us first.|I've been treated by Dr Eric Lonseth for almost 2 years.  I love the staff are friendly and ive always got any answers to questions my phone calls are actually returned same day if I leave a message.  Dr Lonseth  has helped me so much.  Living in pain 24/7 is hard. And I am not only made sure I get pain relief daily I'm about to go get injections for lower back pain this morning.  Will be my 3rd back injections in 2 years and I do get so much relief from the experience and skills that Dr Lonseth has for giving injections He uses CT scans to make sure of each injection place is safely done. I don't know how anyone could leave a bad review about Dr Lonseth or his staff best Doctor who has treated me for my pain and takes time to explain procedures and has been awesome Dr with great knowledge and help for my pain management.  I drive from over an hour to go to him and yes we have pain management doctors closer but well worth my drive. I don't trust any other doctor for my injections in back neck and left shoulder Great Great Great Dr n staff luv u all ty for years of help|Dr Lonseth is very prompt and attentive to my healthcare concerns. Exceptional plan of treatment of care. Great bedside manners. Ms. Cheryl and Dr. Lonseth's staff has the utmost professionalism.|Not only did they cut my meds from 30mg to 7.5 mg but 9 out of 10 times they don't even call in my script on the correct date or time.

Why are you an on call provider but don't call your patients back to gather data about their health?? You determine what's important by sending a message through the an on call service representative. Never have I experienced an on call provider that did not reach out to the patient. This type of practice and response shows there's no true concern or compassion to your patients. The least you could've done was communicate with your patient to determine their concerns and condition for calling during after hours. Sure hope you are not the same person providing treatment to my grandmother. It appears we might have inconvenienced you on a Saturday night and you didn't have time to speak with us to make a truly informed decision regarding her care. Also to mention, I asked if Stephanie can please contact us to ask her a question to see if there was anything we can do to help my grandmother until Monday. She told the representative no she won't call and we just need to wait until Monday.

He listens to me. I have seen him for years. He has always been helpful in trying different things to help reduce my pain. He also has the best staff.|Dr. Kramm has truly been a life saver to me. After having suffered immeasurably for many years from an infected & inflamed opened wound that would never completely heal, Dr. Kramm introduced me to a very simple injection that could help the inflamed nerves to calm down to allow healing to take place. In less than 2 weeks, my wound was completely closed up and my wound care specialist was shocked and asked for his name. 3 weeks prior, bone was visible!

Dr. Kramm truly cares to get to the cause of the problem. His kind and calm bedside manner puts one at ease. He is humble and tells you the truth. Regarding my injection, he was honest snd said there is no scientific evidence that proves this would work, but that based on his experience, he believed it stood a chance at trying. He is truly a Godsend and I recommend him to anyone with chronic pain.|Dr. Kramm continues to be a shining light in an often frustrating world of challenging illness and pain management. He is compassionate, understanding, and Tricia, Stephanie, Catherine, and Kelsey always go over and above to make sure that anything I need is handled. There's no comparison out there. Kramm's the best.|Amazing everything.
he admits to at one point being a young whippersnapper who thought he knew everything and then realized if he wants to help his patients, he's got to listen to us! And he does. If you have pain and no one can seem to figure it out, it could be a soft tissue problem that Western medicine doesn't necessarily think is an issue. Until it turns into an issue. Normally people have to wait for surgery. He does such a vast variety of injections So that the body can heal itself!? Yes, it's true. And we have a lot of work to do on me L O L, but he is not the least bit intimidated by a very very complex situation: congenital issues, along with several injuries that went untreated for many years. Injuries on top of injuries. He's funny and explains things well. Is naturally curious about anything that would help us to alleviate chronic pain. He works well with other doctors and even ask me questions about what to do because it is, as he says, my body.|Dr. Kramm is very kind and understanding. He's the best doctor I've ever seen! And because of my illness, I've seen a lot! If he isn't sure of something, he takes the time to research it. I allowed my husband to go in at several of my visits and he said the same thing! He's the best doctor we've ever seen!|Dr Kramm himself is very good but not his staff. I have been a patient for around 10 years. Unfortunately lost insurance.  Trying to transfer to a doctor on Medicaid for now but won't help. Not even a call back to say no. This after giving me expensive new medicine. I can't afford both a 200+ appointment and over 300 for medicine due to new rules.|I agree with the other reviewer who wrote that Dr. Kramm is the best doctor in the state. I have to add a slight caveat that he is in my top three, but I would find it very hard to rank those three any further than that. He is an exceptional physician who treats me for pain from rheumatoid arthritis and shingles-related nerve damage. I never have to wait more than five minutes in his quiet, peaceful waiting room. His staff is calm and efficient. They must not ever over-book, because Dr. Kramm always spends as much time with me as I need. He explains everything in detail at the level of a patient's ability to understand. He also has a sense of humor and obviously loves people. I hope he will continue to be my doctor for a long, long time!|I have been going to Dr. Kramm for about six months now.  I can barely put into words what this doctor means to me and just how good he is!
I am a very sick female with a lot of problems.   Dr. Kramm has ALWAYS taken his time with me and he actually listens to me.  What doctor does that these days?  He takes care of your problem and for once in many years I can live a quality life.

This is the best doctor in the whole world if you ask me!   There is not another like him!!  If you have issues with pain, this is your doctor.   I would like to keep him to myself, however,  that wouldn't be fair to Dr. Kramm.

The wait time is never over 15 minutes.   There is absolutely nothing about this doctor that I say that's negative.

Years of not being able to function because she's too high on pain pills. Years of me having to answer my children's questions of ""what's wrong with maw maw?"" Years of watching her slowly fade away and and not be able to stay awake through a whole conversation.  Years of watching her endanger herself.  Years of watching her count pills to make sure she has just enough left to pass that drug screen. It's an addiction and Dr. Patel graciously hands out pills like candy to patients to keep them coming back.

Update:  My mother passed away the morning of Christmas Eve 2023.  She had been on Hospice since early November.  Note to others who may be addicted to the high amounts of pain meds this doctor prescribes to you.....  you will be in tremendous pain in your last days here on earth.  Our Hospice organization was astonished at the amount of morphine and fentanyl patches they were having to administer to her to help alleviate some of the pain.  December 23rd, we were having to roll her to clean her.  At that point she was mostly sleeping and barely speaking.  She would scream out in pain.

This was the case as well through her various surgeries.  Ankle surgery, hip surgery, open heart surgery, partial lung removal.  She suffered in pain because unfortunately there is only so much pain medication they can give you before it affects your blood pressure and other various medical conditions.  Therefore, she suffered.  She would cry out to me in pain wanting me to do something for her and there was nothing I could do. She would continuously ask the nurses to please give her more pain medication, but they couldn't.

He's the best pain management doctor around. I have severe scoliosis. My hip started to hurt after I was rear ended. He knew it was from my back. Gave me pain block injections in my lower spine. It's been a few weeks now and it really helped my hip pain. I've been to a few pain management doctors and Dr. Royster is absolutely the best!!|Let me just say if I could give Dr. Royster 0 stars I would. This man is manipulative and bullied me into getting a treatment I was very hesitant about due to the side effect I read about and the contraindications it has with my autoimmune disorder. After receiving the treatment I experienced far worse than I even expected. I have tried to contact this office multiple times and they have been ignoring my calls and they cancelled my appointment. They refuse to acknowledge the side effects I'm having are from the medication they gave me and I've been terrified and feel abandoned by this physician and his actions about my concerns and experience. If you want a doctor who cares for you DO NOT GO TO DR. ROYSTER|I love Dr. Royster and his office staff very much. He is the most empathetic and professional doctor I've ever seen, and I've seen many over the years. He explains every procedural option beautifully. This doctor truly cares about his patients. I'd rate he and his office a 10 if I could.|These folks are the best in the business!! I have been going to Dr Royster before he started his own practice because of a near fatal motorcycle accident in 2009 and have been blessed to be in his care. He works with you with a variety of treatments and really helps manage my pain, he even worked with me when I didn't have medical insurance allowing me to pay as I went. Although I live in Nola I work in Florida so for convenience I tried a local pain management and back specialists here in Florida and it made me realize what a diffrence it makes going to doctors that don't try and give you a one size fits all approach but have multiple methods to deal with your pain etc. So I will gladly spend the money to fly back to Nola from Florida whenever I need to see the good doctor. And also a special shout out to PA Kim Adkins she's the best! Love you guys!|I have been going to pain management Dr.s for awhile now and believe me I've had some night mare experiences. I can honestly say Dr. Royster and staff are very professional, I have never in the 3 years I've been coming here had to wait more than 15 mins in the waiting area. His staff is very polite very helpful. Dr. Royster has always asked me how I am doing and when I answer him he actually listens to what I have to say. He doesn't just go thru the motions he ask i answer and he actually responds to my answer. Every single time I have seen Dr. Royster he is smiling, singing, humming has always been in a very good mood, very easy to communicate with. I highly recommend Doc and his staff I promise you won't regret. Finally a pain Dr. that has compassion and understands chronic pain. Thanks Dr. Royster and staff|Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I haven't experienced his standard practice.  My Neuro surgeon sends me to Dr Royster for specific treatments and he is great.  Good bedside manner that puts me at ease before going unconscious.  Once the referral goes thru everything seems to go thru smoothly.   I can't speak about office visits but I can't believe it would be any different,|Dr. Royster, along with his medical staff, are highly recommended by me.  I have been through the ringer with other doctors, and Dr. Royster puts me at ease and actually listens to me.  He saved me.  I now have a life, can work, and have a purpose finally.  Cheers to you, Dr. Royster and medical staff!|Those people are lying they are people there to just give 5  they don't listen I don't/havnt  ever feet like I was ""listened to"" paper work is constantly wrong.  Been a year. Still wrong to work comp people making me have to do hours of extra leg work to get the therapy.  He just wants to sell you another surgery with a 20% chance of working.  And not only has the most uncomfortable chairs during your 2! Hour sit & wait in them your in more pain than when you arrive.  After 17 years of this injury I've never been treated worse or felt less appreciated as a result of my decision to stop a kidnapping resulting in 2 low back surgeries, than I have by him & his staff!",2024-03-13|2024-03-02|2023-12-15|2020-06-08|2020-08-19|2018-07-04|2022-02-07|2017-11-17,5|1|5|5|5|4|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJp-ns5q-lIIYRY4NYcmmZXuo,25

I truly appreciate his kindness, caring & compassion & am so glad that he is my doctor! ( also kudos to his wonderful staff especially Courtney !)|My doctor retired and I got stuck with a money grubbing pill pushing excuse for a competent pain management doctor. If all you want are drugs then he's your guy.....nothing wrong with that. If you want responsible,long term care, don't waste your time.|Dr. Lee is THE BEST pain management doctor!! If you want to see a very talented, compassionate, intelligent doctor who really cares about his patient's well being and will do everything within his power to make your life pain free, this is the doctor for you.

From performing a much less invasive SI joint fusion to helping me to get off opoids and replacing them with medical cannabis. Getting off the opioids is the best thing that has happened in my pain journey. Medical cannabis has helped me so much more, without the side effects of the opioids.|Dr. Steve C. Lee, is truly a patient-attentive, caring young doctor in the field of pain control. He takes the time needed, understanding that each individual patients life & situation is not always as routine as the regimen prescribed, and works with each person on that basis. Advanced Pain Institute has wonderful staff,
are extremely flexible, and for those who have a true medical need, I'd highly recommend them.|Dr. Lee was highly recommend for pain, but I got a lot more.

Dr. Royster and all of his staff are excellent professionals that address your needs on an individual basis, and you are treated with the utmost respect, compassion and dignity.  It is so refreshing to have not only Dr. Royster there to listen to my concerns and address my issues, but also each and everyone of his staff and nurses.  They will all go out of there way and bend over backwards to help you with any of your concerns.  They are extremely prompt, courteous and they really DO treat their patients as part of their extended family.  I would always recommend these fine folks to anyone that I encounter.  Keep up the great work you guys, it is DEEPLY appreciated and so are each and everyone of you.|Dr. Royster and Dr. Simpson are amazing!
The entire staff team is just as great! From the moment you walk in you'll so welcomed, so at ease and well taken care of; before and after procedures.
Best pain specialist in Louisiana.|I became a patient here in November of 2022 and I was given injections in my neck. As a result I lost my mobility in my right arm. I've tried contacting Dr. Simpson for 4 consecutive months and I was denied access of speaking to him. I went to another state and sought further treatment. Upon my return I went inside the office to sign a medical release form and I was also denied that by the Racist nurses there. At this point I'm having to seek legal advice to obtain my medical records to see if this was a attempt to end my life. I'm advising All African Americans to stay away from this medical facility it's not a African American friendly facility. Dr. Royster staff isn't any better. The entire office is filled with a bunch of unprofessional, rude Racist who don't have the courage to tell African Americans they're not welcome there.|Today, I was Annoyed that I'd waited over an hour and watched 5 people go to the back that came in after me. I verbally expressed my frustration, I heard Several staff members laughing and  talking about me once the door to my room was closed. A nurse/ aid talked to me like she was my elderly grandmother when I said I was Annoyed then had a condescending attitude with me when I answered her back. Completely unprofessional, you can't get mad when a patient is rightfully frustrated and call you out for it. I  won't be back.|COVID restrictions have put medical offices personnel in new and every changing roles.  However, I found the frontend staff friendly and helpful.  The backend clinical staff were kind, and knowledgeable.  Dr. Royster was exactly the type of physician I like working with ~ fully engaged in a conversation, listens and responds.  I would highly recommend Dr. Royster.  Dr. Royster responded to my pain issues with positive outcomes ~ am I cured no ~ but I am not taking medication either.  On going treatment for an on going pain is the plan until another plan requires development.  Thank you IPN!!|Dr. Eric Royster is amazing! I've been with him for several years, and I'm so thankful to have him as my Pain Management SPECIALIST!! He respectfully treats me as an individual with my own special pain issues and does that with  empathy and dignity!! I highly recommend Dr. Royster as a TRUE Pain Management SPECIALIST!!|I am submitting this review based on the quality of service received from staff.  I contacted the clinic as I suffer from migraines and other regular  headaches. I was excited to make an appointment with Dr. Friedman after reading his bio. I was told by a very unfriendly staff member answering the phone that I had to send my medical records prior to making an appointment. (Something I have never had to do for any other clinic). None the less, I requested my records to be be sent from my former doctor's office and a couple weeks later sent an email to the office of Integrated Pain and Neuroscience to ask if they had received my records so I could call and make an appointment. I sent this email three times and never received a response. It is 2019 and it is common practice to use email as a communication tool during our busy days. To be ignored by the staff of a pain clinic is utterly disrespectful and unprofessional. Unfortunately I will never find out if Dr. Friedman is a wonderful doctor as I must now start a new search due to the lack of empathy and professionalism of this clinic's staff.|I can't say enough about how great this place is.  The doctors are very personable, actually listen, take their time with each patient, and have/use a wide variety of tools/techniques at their disposal to help their patients out. I really can't say enough about the wonderful job these doctors do. Wish there was a 6th star I could give them. Very highly recommended. Call and ask to see Dr Royster or Kim today.

From your appointment time until he sees you plan an hour and you a half to two hours waiting in those hard little chairs, I usually bring a book..|Dr. Aust is undeniably the most compassionate pain management doctor I have encountered. He is extremely educated on a vast variety of conditions.
After 10 years of having a debilitating pain issue starting in my early 30s that led to a much lower and very difficult quality of life, Dr. Aust took the time to get my pain, which was a general 5-8 daily, under better control, around a 4-6 per day until we could do the surgery that took my pain down to a 0-2 ALL THE TIME. Dr. Aust gave me back my quality of life from the horrible condition of the bladder called IC. He and his growing staff are exceptional.
His Nurse Practitioner, Nicole, is also compassionate and extremely capable for continuing care.
My best doctor hands down.|Dr.Aust was highly recommended by a top neurosurgeon at Southern Brain and Spine when I explained to them that I would prefer not to do major invasive surgery with the fusion. Dr AUST really knows what he's doing. I've been going to him for several years now and he gets results. Namely pain relief, Without fusion surgery. I would highly recommend him to anyone suffering from miserable, debilitating back pain. His whole staff and team are professionals. They're fast efficient knowledgeable and friendly. Bottom line they get the job done.|Personally, Dr. Aust is an excellent pain management doctor. I would recommend him highly I mean really highly anyone who needs help for Painmanagement.|Dr Aust has done medial blocks and rhizotomies on my shoulders and lower back from injuries I received from a car wreck years ago and I refused surgery then. All the non invasive procedures have been a total success.  He even corrected the 1 rhizotomy that another doctor done, in Dr Aust absence...my mistake for allowing the other Dr to do and dismissed his mistake in the procedure.  Dr Aust fixed the other Dr's mistake.  I am so thankful for everything Dr Aust has and still is doing for me.  He is so committed and compassionate with his patients. I will never see anyone else. He has saved me from the horrible surgeries that other Dr's have said I needed. My best decision ever when I found Dr Aust.  If you have the opportunity to see him, you will be glad you did. I have several friends I suggested him to and they too are happy with the outcome of seeing Dr Aust too.|I truly was looking forward to working with Dr. Aust--he came highly recommended by some top political affiliates/close friends who have utilized his services--it's unfortunate that I called on Septmeber 11-expressed the major concern with current, persistent Sciatica--I was told I could not schedule an Appt due to ""New Patient Coordinator"" being Out-Of-Office; I was told the next day, would receive a call; never did--until Friday (September 15)--of course, the pain was persistently heavy, which is what prompted my call as semi-emergency attention was needed; it seems for  whatever reason, someone dropped the ball on properly following up with a potential new client who owns several thriving businesses and would have gladly paid over and beyond the cost of rendered services--when the person did finally reach out, the energy seemed apathetic and certainly unapologetic. It's unfortunate you have to jump thru so many hoops, which prevented a potentially great patient-Doctor relationship from being formed and a path to alleviating persistent Sciatica.|Dr. Aust is not only on of the kindest people in the world, he is an amazing doctor. I have suffered with lots of back pain from a car wreck 5 years ago, and Dr. Aust  has not only alleviated so much of the hurt, but he has constantly been concerned and checks up on me to make sure I am doing well. He is NOT the standard "" Let's do surgery"" doctor. In fact , his methodologies are designed around not having to rely on pain medication and surgeries. I highly recommend Dr. Aust! Just to top it off, his manners and consideration are unparalleled.

Staff locked entrance doors refuses to have a face to face conversation about my appointment on that day. They yelled threw the door we are closed at 11:30am which is rude to a paying customer.|This place solves pain issues. The Dr.J is the best. He has the answer for your problem . The  staff is amazing. If you need professional help, this is the place to be.|This is a pill mill. Went to this doctor for over 2 years and only physically seen him twice. Unscrupulous doctors like this is the reason why the opiod epidimic is out of control. My visits consist of a urine sample to staff and usually a wait for up to 30 minutes to answer routine questions about your medication which takes at the most 2 minutes from a office staff. Then a couple of hours later the doctor would call and the entire call would last from 8 to 10 seconds and in that time he gives you your next office visit. There is no way this is practicing medicine and being concern for your patients health. This doctor has no idea who I am! Then he calls my prescription in that's it. On my last visit instead of waiting my up to 30 minutes I waited for 2 and 1/2 hours for the staff to come get me and ask me questions I was irritated and told the staff that sitting for 2 1/2 hours is not good for my back. They called in medicine. I assumed everything was okay but 33 days later when I had not received my call to come in I left a message for the office and then at that time was told I was released from the clinic without any notice. The doctor is well aware of my medical condition and this is illegal for him not to give me proper notification to seek another doctor. This was done out of spite from his incompetent staff! I did get my medication! Doctor is in it only for money! He is rich!|Love doc munjumpali and his staff. They are very kind and helpful. I felt taken care of and my appointment was stress free.|He's a terrible doctor as you can see by his ratings by patients. I seen this doctor dismiss an elderly woman in her early 80's because she missed an appointment the day before because of transportation issues with Medical transportation which she took from Mansfield, Louisiana. I also seen the same with other patients for no reason|Great doctor & staff!! They never make me feel judge for being there. Would recommend to anyone! I literally drive 2 hours to see Dr M!|Stay away is all I can say. I have never witness anything in a doctors office like what I witnessed at this place. Doesn't care one way or the other about treating people..3 hours past my appointment  finally  see this man. Look elsewhere if you need health care.|Dr. Munjampalli's office usually runs very well.  You usually have to leave a message and be called back to talk to them,  but they usually phone back pretty quickly. PA's are also usually done pretty quickly as well.  I do use the word usually because like everywhere else, sometimes things fall through the cracks. The staff is always absolutely amazing!! As for Dr. Munjampalli, I like him very much.  I had a false positive drug screen,  which he only asked me about after the !4th! false positive test. Most doctors would have booted me after the first one without even exploring the reason for it. I explained I have had this issue before because of one of the other medications I take that cause a false positive result.  He took me at my word and gave me an oral test the next time. He does everything he can to make sure I can stay a patient and get the treatment I need. My only very small issue is I needed a tiny increase in my medication and it then became about smoking.  Asking me if I just planned on being on these medications for the rest of my life and if I didn't help myself he wasn't going to continually up my medication. Again small issue,  his reasoning was medically spot on. Which he actually took the time to explain. Overall, I recommend him highly. No place is ever perfect,  but here they do try very hard to be just that, perfect.",2024-12-04|2024-12-11|2023-08-28|2024-07-22|2024-06-19|2024-04-09|2023-12-23|2022-11-23,1|5|1|5|2|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJN-IPC8csMYYRWrRcIUHru74,23

I was originally disappointed with the service. When one is severe pain, one reacts! Since getting the lack of communication issues taken care of, I must state that Dr. Fincke has gone above and beyond to help me resolve my back issues. I thank you and pray I bounce back from the debilitating problem. Thank you for your help!|Since 2005 I have been under the compassionate care of several of the doctors and physicians assistance. I would hate to think of loosing any of them now.
Thank you to the team of kind and caring health givers.|The staff is friendly and helpful with your exercises. Patrick is my mama's therapist and he is super nice and does a good job.|I was going nowhere with another clinic and I found another clinic, The Spine and Pain Treatment Centre. They started working on my case and over a few months, I could feel a more comfortable and relaxed place. It has been 7 years now and with some new treatments on the way,|I am a brand new patient. Matter of fact, I have yet to see a doctor, but they are working on getting me scheduled. In 2010, I fell through my attic and landed on my hardwood floor. Ended up with 2 compression fractures at T11, and L1. Also blowed several disc out in my Lumbar spine. I had a double discectomy to cut the bulges off of the disc that blew out. After that, I have lived in very bad pain, and have been declared fully disabled. My latest MRI shows degenerative disc disease, and  alot of arthritis from the breaks, along with calcium growth on my vertebrae from the fractures.
Im from Natchez, Ms, and was previously seeing Dr Vance, at Comprehensive pain management of Madison. He was a great doctor, and had me on a great regimen of RF ablations, sacroiliac injections, and medication. I was actually able to have a decent quality of life again, playing with my kids, and such. Then, he adopted a no nicotine policy. Like an idoit, I'm a smoker, and just couldn't drop the cigarettes, so he had to let me go. I gave this place 5 stars, because so far, they have been very helpful trying to get me in to see a doctor. I will update this review after a few visits, but I also have heard very good things about this place such as, MOST of the doctors genuinely care about you and your pain. I need a doctor that cares, and will help me. I'm praying that this is the place, and they dont judge me by my arm tattoos, country boy exterior and such. Alot of places are quick to judge. Hopefully we will soon see, as I'm supposed to call them Monday 9/7/20, to set up an appointment. I must do something, because my quality of life has went down over the past couple of months, not having a pain management doctor. I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do to help me.|They switched my appointment because my regular PA couldn't be there. Then they forgot to switch me back. I sat waiting for 2 hours. The woman at the desk somehow messed up!! I checked in at 10:30 left at 12:00! No excuse for this!!!|Good luck trying to reach your doctor or his assistant when calling.  You MIGHT get a call back at the end of the NEXT day.  Front desk etiquette is horrible and unprofessional.  The only good thing about this office were my visits with Dr. Braswell, whom I will miss.  He has great bedside manner and he's very caring and compassionate.  He listens to my concerns with patience and understanding.   Dr. Jiha is the WORSE 'medical professional' I have ever encountered.  That is why I am changing locations to receive my medical treatment.|By far the worst experience I have had with Ochsner. I was initially seen in the emergency room at Our Lady Of the Lake with dangerous elevated blood pressure and no sensation throughout my entire left leg. I was ""patched "" up until I could see my primary physician, which is in network with Ochsner. I was referred to Dr.Das about two to three ago for the earlier appointment available. I was not notified for an earlier appointment of no sort. I called to inform nurse that I was caught in traffic and was 7 minutes away from the office and was pretty much given an ultimatum to be checked in within 5 mins or I would have to be rescheduled. This was so upsetting considering the fact I left work two hours early and live the next state over. I have never experienced such negligence especially when a patient is experiencing some of the things I have.

They won't let you change to another doctor in their clinic even if you're willing to drive to south Baton Rouge or Denham Springs. You're stuck with Dr. Braswell and his incompetents and his staff no matter how bad you are willing to change.

They have lost so many patients I don't think the satellite clinic will be open much longer.  I truly think that they transferred Dr. Braswell to Zachary because they didn't have any returning Baton Rouge patients willing to continue with him.  Very poor patient care and attention.

You have to be 26 in order to have a quicker process in getting your medical card, but if you're younger they lay out all the steps to take and make it super easy!! Love love love Mrs. Felicia !!|Easy in, easy out.  All the staff was very friendly, making the appointment painless.  Ms. Felicia Smith, the Nurse Practitioner, was most knowledgeable and informative in delivering the necessary information.|I can say, without a doubt, that my experience with Pause Pain & Wellness in Hattiesburg, MS, has been nothing short of transformative. From the moment I walked into the clinic, I felt welcomed, supported, and understood--a stark contrast to the often intimidating or overwhelming experiences that can come with medical treatments. The level of care, professionalism, and compassion at this clinic is truly unparalleled.

One of the standout elements of my experience was the incredible staff, particularly Felicia Smith. Felicia has an extraordinary ability to make you feel at ease. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable about the medical cannabis process but also takes the time to genuinely listen to your concerns and needs. It's clear that she is passionate about helping her patients live better, more pain-free lives. She explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and never rushed through any part of the consultation. In fact, I left feeling empowered and confident about the next steps in my wellness journey.

The entire team at Pause Pain & Wellness embodies a holistic, patient-centered approach that I find so refreshing. It's rare to find a healthcare facility where the staff is not only invested in your physical health but in your overall well-being. Everyone I encountered, from the receptionists to the medical professionals, treated me with respect, kindness, and professionalism. The clinic itself is bright, inviting, and designed to make you feel at home. The calm, soothing atmosphere makes it clear that the team is committed to creating a healing environment for their patients.

As someone who had been struggling with chronic pain and the side effects of traditional medications for years, I was initially apprehensive about exploring medical cannabis. However, the staff at Pause Pain & Wellness made the process seamless. They took the time to educate me on how cannabis could be a viable option for pain management, walking me through the various strains, dosage options, and potential effects. I felt fully supported in my decision to pursue this path, and it has absolutely changed my life. The results have been incredible, and I now experience relief from pain in a way I never thought possible.

Felicia Smith, in particular, deserves special recognition. Her guidance and compassion were invaluable during the entire process. She answered all of my questions (and trust me, I had plenty!) and ensured that I was comfortable and well-informed every step of the way. It's clear that she truly cares about the people she serves, and her dedication to her patients is evident in every interaction. I felt like I was not just another patient on a list, but a person whose health and happiness truly mattered to her.

Beyond the medical side of things, I also want to mention how easy and stress-free the entire process is at Pause Pain & Wellness. The staff takes care of all the paperwork, assists with the application for a medical marijuana card, and walks you through the legalities and regulations in Mississippi. There's no need to feel overwhelmed or confused--everyone here is there to guide you through it all with patience and understanding.|The entire staff was excellent. Very seamless and pleasant experience. Felicia Smith FNP-C, was very knowledgeable and informative about the whole process!|This clinic is very helpful! I was super nervous and Dr Felicia Smith was very nice and made me feel less anxious.

They have explained to me each thing every step of the way. I did ask Dr Mahmoud to give me warning before an injection and he's been very careful to do so, again, explaining to me each step he was taking.
When a person gets here, most likely they have really bad pain and that will not necessarily go away immediately.  I can be patient and wait for the proper procedure to help.
Yes, it's frustrating that I have to wait for the insurance company to approve of upcoming procedures and I have to wait my turn for each procedure, stretching out the time before the pain procedure can be done. But, that is not the fault of Dr Mahmoud and his excellent staff. It has to do with insurance companies and many people leaving medical positions during Covid and nor yet being replaced. It also has to do with Maine's large elderly population who have many pain issues.
NL Interventional Pain Management are doing superb work.|As a medical doctor, a trained physician, I listen carefully to my providers. When something isn't clear I speak up right away. As can happen, bone on bone hip arthritis pain came on suddenly for me 2 years ago during chemotherapy. After much PT and imaging I was referred to pain intervention with hopes for some temporary abatement of pain. Surgery was the most desired treatment as it would provide a long term solution. So my first and only visit with a pain management clinical provider seemed good with referral for steroid injection and orthopedic surgery, however, my spouse and I are now being gaslighted.
No one said a steroid injection would delay by 3 months minimum the much needed and desired hip replacement surgery the severity of which was known by all. Nor was it said that this would also introduce an increased risk of infection even still at 3 months out.
The orthopedic surgeon I saw two days after the injection was livid that these people hadn't yet gotten it straightened out. The patient needs to be informed that they need to see ortho first in severe cases as surgery could have already been done and recovery well on its way in just a couple weeks. Orthopedists can also provide steroid injection. Now I wait 3 months in pain with chronic inflammation and debilitating quality of life.
After many attempts to talk with someone at pain intervention, someone other than the MA, I was sent a letter stating that basically, yes they did tell me about the 3 month delay because the box on the computer report is checked off and that's that.
As an aside, the same physicians clinical note for this visit presents in detail the severity of lumbar scoliosis seen on MRI while her physical exam said my spine was completely normal without deformity at all ! In clinical practice I have used electronic medical records software. Clicking enough boxes ensures full insurance reimbursement. It doesn't matter if it's congruent or correct.
I'm a 3 year survivor of an aggressive breast cancer. Managing inflammation is key. The pain management providers took no consideration of that or my adamant desire for surgery as soon as possible. They didn't listen to me or my spouse who is a 20 year Navy vet and retired Recreational Therapist with a four year college degree. She's really upset feeling that they're essentially calling her a liar. The delay for surgery was absolutely not discussed. Seriously broken trust.
There's a known and ongoing problem with the Northern Light Pain Intervention system/protocol and the pain intervention folks are taking it personally. They're refusing to speak with me and hear what I offer as a solution. They are behaving like unprofessional, rural hospital administrators who care less about patients and most about keeping their mill of steroid injections running at top speed. Technical skills are great. They got the needle in the joint but there's little relief for this severity of eroding bone on bone arthritis. Their skills, even caring to help patients get real pain relief, these are atrocious. Beware of what they're not telling you or what may be documented that never happened.|The worst place to send a patient. I saw Dr. Mahmood, he made promises, said if the shot didn't work the first time he would do it again in a few weeks. They were rude, he and his nurse sent me out with my leg numb from hip to toes. No wheelchair, no escort nothing. Then instead of a follow up appointment I get a letter discharging me. He was full of himself and the needle went too deep causing no pain relief but made me a fall risk, then they discharge me! I would NEVER recommend this incompetent office to anyone!!|Horrible service and care. Picked up 86-year-old father, who was in pain, and drove 2.5 hours to get there.  Told that computers were down, so can't be seen because no way to view image and medical records.  Told recepionist that I had copies of image on disc, and copy of medical records.  Receptionist told Dr. Ammar Mahmoud that, then he said he had no way of documneting visit with computers down.  Informed receptionist that documentation could be done via writing it on paper, then transposing to comuter when they came up.  This is a Medicare Continuity of Operations (COOP) requirement.  Was told Dr. Mahmoud was not willing to do that.  Then asked to stay for a bit, to see if the computers came back up, because father was in pain.  Receptionist said no, Dr Mahnoud had already cancelled all of his appointments and gone  for the day.  Had 2.5 hour drive to get father (still in pain) home.  I do NOT recommend this place.  They seem to do only the bare minimum and seem to have no regard for patient well-being.|Iam extremely upset with this place. I have scoliosis, arthritis, and 2 blown joints in my spine. I've dealt with is for 2 years and it took them 2 years to actually schedule me and my primary was not impressed. I have to call a couple times and wait weeks before anyone will call me back. They tried yelling me I called the wrong place but confirmed I did not.
Another time they tried telling me that someone did call me but I did not recall voicemail. But they insisted I was the one who was wrong.
They tell me I can only get injections every 3 months but it's always 4 and they make me come in for a new visit each time. I'm in pain, it effects my work, how me life, and family life... I get in young but my back and pain don't care. They should|The people who work here are my heroes. My autoimmune diseases leave me in horrific pain, but these guys always help me.

The nurses are the best and help keep my anxiety from getting out of control. The lady who does the scheduling and gets the approvals from the insurance companies,  Peggy I think,  is a miracle worker!

I am a Long COVID patient who has been suffering with a multitude of issues and symptoms for almost 3 years. It has been a very life changing and debilitating experience, but Dr Littlejohn has been able to help ease some of my symptoms and is in the process of helping me even more! I feel very comfortable, safe, and confident in his treatment plans/ideas and recommendations. I have seen many specialists since having COVID and I highly recommend giving Dr Littlejohn a try.|Dr. Littlejohn is a lifesaver.  He was able to get me in within 48 hours when nobody else I called could see me for over a month.  I was in so much sciatica pain I would have gone to the ER if I couldn't see someone.

I hadn't had any injections for my spine issue before but he was able to clearly explain the process and put me at ease.

The epidural injection really helped ease my pain until I can consult with a surgeon.  He clearly cares a lot for his patients.  I'm very grateful for Dr Littlejohn and his quality care and willingness to get me in quickly.|Dr Littlejohn and his team have been supportive and always tried to provide the best care for my chronic pain. While I may end up working with a neurosurgeon to finally resolve the issue, they made every effort to help me with my sciatic nerve pain. I think if I had sought them out sooner, the injections may have been more effective - I waited for months. Don't be scared of the injections - great doc who will put you at ease and work hard to keep you amused if you struggle with needles. Compassionate, smart, and a great sense of humor.|Dr Littlejohn is great, his bedside manner is considerate and he truly listens. He clearly explained the treatment options for my generalized pain and with his guidance I elected to try low dose naltrexone. I was truly amazed with the effectiveness of the treatment and am excited to be able to get back to doing the things I had not been able to for the last 3 years.|I'm not certain what to make of this guy.However a big red flag for me is it seems many of his treatments aren't covered by insurance.There's a reason insurance companies refuse to pay for particular treatments.Most commonly it's because it's been proven to not work.  Most importantly, he doesn't advertise what he does.He has a blank web page.Not even the literature in his office describes any specific types of treatments.I found this to be very suspicious. All these things combined, lead me to believe the guy is basically preying on the desperate. I'm 65 and have never heard of any doctor anywhere, requiring that you provide a credit card for him to keep on file.Despite the fact I'm well insured. Give me one instance where you would need to charge my card if I wasn't there. Just one. I dare you. It's a scam.And there was absolutely nothing informing me  of your ""policy""  or I wouldn't have driven 75 miles. I have a policy as well. It's to not let medical charlatans bully me. How's your policy working out for you? I got an appointment with you in a few days. And the place was completely empty. Two more giant red flags. As far as I'm concerned you're a criminal in a lab coat.|I was suffering with severe back pain and was unable to see my usual physician for weeks.  Dr. Littlejohn saw me immediately and recognized the cause of my pain, he performed an injection and made numerous treatment options. I have recommended friends see Dr Littlejohn and each has been pleased with his treatment plans  as well as his interpersonal interactions. He and his office staff are definitely patient centered which is a refreshing experience in todays health care environment.|I was recently in back pain following a surgical procedure. I am also a physician who has treated and understands pain. Its however different when one is a patient! My experience with Dr. Littlejohn was simply superior, beginning with his warm and caring office staff to his treatment of my condition. Dr. Littlejohn was very professional, reassuring and competent in his explanation of what my medical issue was along with an extremely caring bedside manner. The treatment was nearly painless and the relief was almost instantaneous and as Dr. Littlejohn predicted, continued to get even better over the next 6 hours. I strongly recommend Dr Littlejohn for anyone experiencing acute or chronic pain.

I mentioned this to Dr Gray and he said there isn't any money in it!! I'm applauded he even mentioned money! He's not there to help you he just wants the money! I refuse to pay 125$ for a no show appointment.  He injected my back with something and it didn't do nothing.  I do not recommend him! ((|The absolute worst Dr.  If I could, he would get zero stars.  He doesn't care at all about any options you present.  In fact I am pretty sure he sees it as a challenge and then makes fun of you for having the nerve.  When we discussed why an injection from a procedure he did had helped to manage the pain, I was excited that there was something that could finally help that wasn't a gabapentin (which he kept increasing the dose saying ""it's helping you more than you realize"").  It was not helping at all.  He quickly shut that down stating that injection is ""no longer allowed"".   He literally lied about the injection and said there was nothing more he could do, that gabapentin was the best thing to help manage the extreme pain (and at the time I literally couldn't walk a block).  I said that med was not helping and not a long term solution, that whatever was causing the pain needed to be fixed.  I asked about surgery.  He said that wasn't an option.  Maybe so, but then he was laughing at me and then implied I was trying to get opioid meds and he won't do that.

Fast forward a few years (Dr Hall just down the road who gave me my life back), I found out later from a guy I was dating, he gets the exact injections from Gray that Gray said are no longer allowed.  The exact same injections I get through my current Dr.  So he plays God and gets to mess with your life, while you suffer.  He doesn't care and has such an ego, he laughs at you if you don't agree with him.  After all, he is the ""Harvard trained expert.""  Well from now on I consider that to be the biggest joke of all, as anyone who says that is more ego than expert!
If you are lucky enough to get relief from your pain by whatever he does, that's awesome!  If not, run!  Don't waste months and months of pain and suffering.  Dr Hall is infinitely better!  He listens and he cares, and he doesn't insult you by implying you are a drug seeker when you are trying to fix the problem that is causing the pain.

News flash Gray,  I am back to having a full life despite your insistence that gabapentin was the solution.  I don't even take Tylenol.  Thanks for the insult and memory loss.  That little gem of a side effect was not discussed.  You failed in your oath to do no harm, you let your ego dictate and as a result cause years of needless suffering.|I went to see Dr. Gray after I was told by other medical people that there was nothing they could do to stop my chronic debilitating leg pain. I was  unable to walk without sharp pains randomly firing down my legs. This was keeping me from living my life. I am a big car show fan but the pain was stopping me from walking the show area. Dr. Gray was able to trigger my pain on command reinforcing the fact that he knew what the issue was. He did some tests and confirmed he could remove the worst of my pain. When he did the final injections, I discovered he had done as he promised. The worst pain was gone and all that remained was what I could easily deal with. I started going back to car shows and going on long walks. I owe him so much. He changed my life in such a positive way. He is a straight shooter and I always appreciate that about him. You know where you stand. I recommend Dr. Gray with the highest of praise. I was in pain that was ruling my life. With his help I am living my life. Thank's Doctor Gray!|If you are looking for someone to alleviate your back or neck pain- or perhaps anything else you may have- make an appointment with Dr. Gray-- its a great practice that is thriving on honesty and results.  I recently moved here and i can assure you if i was still in Rhode Island i would have probably been scheduled for 2 major shoulder surgeries by now- Dr. Gray recommends you to another very ethical surgeon - who will only operate if you need it! What a concept!!  Unfortunately so many places have become meat markets- where you dont even meet the doctor = just a PA- then they schedule you for surgery.  Dr. Gray sends you to the right place- fortunately for me I did not need surgery - then followed up with 2 injections that have fixed my pain.  Wonderful practice with great staff - do not hesitate to call - you will be taken care of .|If I could leave 10 stars I would.  DR.

From the front desk, to triage groups to the nurses and physicians are all A+++. I have lived with extreme chronic pain since I was around 15 years old and have had so many surgeries I've lost count. Dr's Tivnan & Wise are doing everything and anything to help me avoid more surgery. I can not thank them enough for the relief I receive. For the people who complain about the pain after (of course it's going to be uncomfortable) but the rewards most times are so worth it. The doctors always listen to me and I trust their decisions on the appropriate direction to take. There is no other place I would ever consider going and refer so many friends here. Thank you to the entire office for making me feel like the only person who you treat in a busy environment. You truly are all caring and compassionate individuals and I'm forever grateful.|They are fast, friendly, and the shots are for the most part effective. The doctors don't say that the shots will do more than they do.|These guys have made a HUGE difference in my life!  I'm only 44, but I came down with a chronic pain issue.  It is a very outside the box type of muscular condition.  I have seen literally 18 doctors over the last 4 years, and pretty much all of them tried to convince me that their thing would cure me.  They were happy to collect the money even though they NEVER delivered results.

Just before going to Northeast Pain Management I went to Northern Light and unfortunately had a horrible experience in their clinic as well.   They treated trigger point injections as if it were major surgery.  Put me in a damn gown with a hair net and the like and put me in a room with like 20 other people separated by sheets.  And they would only inject me with preset amount and wouldn't go over their predetermined limit, so basically half my body was left untreated.  And when I was still in pain later, and I called there was zero responsiveness.  They left me in pain, and when I complained, they tried to send me to a Boston clinic.  Really?  You want me to drive to Boston while in life altering pain?!

Annnyway, the point of this review was not to talk trash about Northern Light or the other doctors I have had trouble with.  The point is that these guys are an oasis in a desert.  The doctor I see most often is Dr. Tivnan, and he is fantastic.  Super personable.  Treats you like a human being.  Really listens.  Treats you on the spot.  Gets all the areas.  And I always walk away feeling better and with a substantial reduction in my pain.  I really feel like it's been a collaboration.  I mean, I'm no doctor, but I've  tried like 20 whatever treatments, so that's probably important info right?  You'd be surprised how many doctors never even want to take in that information and just want to condescend to you and put you in your place.

The culture here is different.  Like I said, Dr. Tivnan is just plain awesome.  But I have seen other doctors as well.  Sorry I'm forgetting names!  But they were good as well.  It's the culture there.  You feel it when you walk in the door.  And honestly from the administrators at the front desk, to the nurses that prep you for the exams, to the doctors that do the consultations, to the doctors that do the actual procedures you always feel respected and cared about.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  They have made all the difference in my life.

Thank you Dr. Tivnan!  And thank you Northeast Pain Management!|Went for my first appointment after driving 2 hrs to get there...they hit me with $2000 deposit. I have a job in health care and insurance. My understanding is here in maine you need to tell people what the bill is going to be. I paid my copay never recieved a bill. Went back for follow up they still insist on getting deposit. I had enough...this sounds like not healthcare.|Every staff member, nurse, and doctors I've met here have been friendly, positive, professional and most importantly, caring. My pain management plan through them has allowed me to STOP needing my cane! They have the most up to date equipment, and most certainly the knowledge & expertise
allowing extensive success! I would rate them 10 stars if I could! Many thanks!!!|Horrible. They gave me injections that caused me excruciating pain for days after. I called to tell him and he said to deal with if for ten day's. When I called to say I didn't think we clicked and asked for a different provider and explained what happened, the receptionist said if I didn't like it, I didn't have to go there. That was helpful, because I am actually stuck with them. So, all around bad tratment. The burning and pain are so intense I can't deal with it anymore. His bedside manor is awful. Treats you like garbage with the first appointment. Absolutely nothing positive came from that appointment. I left in more pain than I had when I went in. Now I have no idea what to do.|After suffering a back injury, and having my care mishandled by Maine Nuero, I was referred to Northeast Pain Management.
I have been to these doctors numerous times, and I found them to be professional, engaging, and truly helpful.
I would suggest this fantastic group of doctors to anyone seeking pain relief through injections. No doubt that these miracle workers can help.|Saw Dr Tivnan as a new patient.  Worst Dr experience I have ever had in my life.
Defensive when I asked questions, barely examined me, asked no questions about the history of my pain and then misdiagnosed me as later images and seeing a different Dr confirmed.

I refused a follow-up.

I was hopeful that I would finally get relief from my back issues here. I did not. I saw someone named Ryan at the outset. I don't know who he is, what credentials he has or doesn't have, if he's a NP or something else. That would have been helpful to know. However, he was incredibly dismissive, and guess what? He was wrong. He told me what I needed, and it was incorrect. I had the procedure, it didn't work, and they told me they can't do anything for me.
Wrong answer. First, Ryan was dismissive and abrupt. It was clear he didn't want to be there. He ended the office visit after a few minutes. What I didn't know was there was no anesthesia for my procedure and it hurt like hell! (Some other places do have anesthesia, I checked).
I saw an orthopedist today because my family doctor had given me the referral to Mercy Pain Center. The orthopedist took one look at my x-ray and told me immediately what the problem was and what was causing my pain. He told me that the Pain Center gave me the wrong procedure and that I should have had something else. He's referring me somewhere else so I can finally get the relief I've been looking for. And they have anesthesia!
I had high expectations for this place. I was incredibly disappointed. Why I was given the wrong procedure I'll never know. I'm not happy, and I'm not recommending this place to anyone.|I was referred by Spectrum Orthaepedics. Initial consult in October was not pleasant.  I was in a car accident last year and had a neck injury.  I was hoping to get a procedure that would give me relief from the constant pain.  The woman I saw was abrasive and somewhat dismissive of my condition.  I had an MRI and other scans that clearly showed inflammation.  She made several comments to me that I felt were not appropriate.  She did tell me that the procedure could be done by the end of the year.  I should expect a phone call within a few weeks to schedule.  Five weeks passed and no call.  I called them yesterday and got the run around.  Told me the authorization takes time.  I asked when it was submitted.  They wouldn't tell me.  Now the procedure can't be done until January.  At the time of the visit, I stated that I met my deductible for the year and was hoping this could be completed before January.  I was told that it could.  I immediately called my insurance company after my call with them.  They stated that the authorization was submitted yesterday, not five weeks ago.  They lied. They only submitted it after I had called to inquire about the delay in contacting me.  I called back to cancel the procedure.  I will be going elsewhere.   What an absolutely horrible experience.

Update: 12/9.
In response to your reply to this post, I did call the office four days ago and spoke to your office manager.  She had nothing to offer other than an appointment for January.  New year, out of pocket expense.  This practice is lacking in many areas.  They failed miserably in the follow up regarding the initial consultation and the PA was not someone I would want to work with again.  The fact that they lied to me about the authorization speaks volumes.  Why not just tell me the truth?   I would never recommend this practice to anyone.|Dr. Ryan Trosper and his team are the best. Honestly, I've been dealing with neuropathy pain for 15 years and I'm only 31 years old. I came in and his team was so pleasant. I didn't have high hopes for coming in since I had been to what felt like a ton of doctors but he listened, he felt like he cared, and he actually set me up with something that finally, FINALLY, gave me relief. Also, all of the ladies at the front and back desks are always so nice. I actually really like coming to this office, they truly are the VIPs!|Nice place and was easy to find for me . Nobody was rude staff and doctor were nice but they couldn't do much for me except offer trigger point injections. And ask me why I'm a thin small framed guy . I've always been slim in a healthy way . Then the doctor said I was lucky I got pain managment from my doctor . Seems like my primary doctor did better pain management then what mercy offered.if I did the trigger point injections it be every month pretty much . And there's twenty symptoms to what they wanted to inject me with so I called my doctor and explained why I didn't want to go thru that she agreed with me . Mercy tries to be nice but in the end they really couldn't do anything for me . Except wanting to inject me with dexamethasone side effects are as bad as anabolic steriods.|As a new patient my first encounter with the NP made me feel as tho I was ""faking"".  She was dismissive of my previous pain Drs treatment.Very negative of the treatment I'd been given which btw was fantastic and worked!  Only reason I went to NL was because I returned to East Coast. Also NP informed me the center does not offer any anesthesia for my type of treatment.  The NP made me feel less than important and a  ""whimp"".  Within 10 min of my appt I gathered my things and left. Not how I'm used to being treated!|All of the staff and especially the nurses were so caring and kind and friendly. Dr. Karl Hinrichs was the best. I am getting better thanks to this office! I HIGHLY recommend this practice and Dr. Hinrichs!!|When an appointment is scheduled, it would be helpful to list which suite, and the name of the office the appointment is at. The Directory on the main floor doesn't list doctor's names. As a result, I was a few minutes late, because I had to ask if I had the right office a couple times. When I finally found the place. I had to wait in line again, and discovered my appointment was cancelled. I was told their policy cancels if you're even 10 minutes late.  The signage in this building is terrible! It would be helpful to have proper notification as to where the Suite is, especially for new patients. I only had the doctor's name, not the name of the practice, or the suite. 195 Fore River is a large building to try to locate a doctor.  Had I known he was at the Pain Center, that would have made tracking down the appointment easier.

This is the biggest complaint about this facility...lack of proper signage (list doctor's names on the Main Directory).|I have always had very positive experiences at the pain clinic at Northern Lights. Every staff member I have encountered including those who pick up the phone,  the front desk, the MA, and Christina Lee have been kind and compassionate. I have a lot of poorly controlled pain that has caused me a great deal of anxiety, extreme difficulty sleeping, and difficulty doing nearly everything. I am always very anxious about going to the doctor's but the staff here are calming and make me feel safe and comfortable discussing my medical issues.

I don't remember his name unfortunately, and it's been changed in my chart to Dr. Martinez. The first Dr. I saw barley even looked at me when speaking to me. told me I was too fat, and ""just need to lose weight."" the entire appointment I felt he was dismissive and belittling. I requested a different dr for my next visit. This dr told me I HAD to do a treatment I didn't agree with before he would even consider an MRI for the injury I was there for. I tried said treatment and it made it worse. So, I told him that and asked him to order the MRI and if insurance denied the claim I'd handle it. that was in February. now in June, I have NO ANSWERS AND NO ONE WILL GET BACK TO ME.
also, when I asked to change drs, the woman at the front desk said, ""well, are you sure, he's really nice! he must just be having an off day. no really, he's really nice, give it one more chance."" I told her I didn't care how bad a day he's having, it's NO excuse to be dismissive and disrespectful to patients. if I could give this place negative stars I would. don't go there.|I haven't felt this good in years!

I highly recommend Dr Martinez he is very knowledgeable and obviously cares about his patients. Thank you so much for putting me on the right track.
Ted Weber Jr|I went to see Dr. Perkowski for a second opinion for chronic back pain, and I appreciated his knowledge and experience. A previous physician injected a steriod shot in my spine, when there was never any need to do so. I felt very hesitant to see the previous physician, so I was referred to Dr. Perkowski, and he relayed to me that my spine was in fact healthy and that there was no need for that shot.   As much as his expertise shows, his attitude showed just as much. He was oddly frustrated with me when explaining that my spine my healthy  like I was at fault for being told the first time there was an issue with my spine, like I had no business to be in his office. I went to him to get a second opinion which I was very happy to know that my spine is in fact healthy, but he spoke to me like I was a waste of his time and effort. Even when I explained a couple of concerning symptoms to him, he made the face equivalent to rolling his eyes and just completely dismissed me. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day, but I surely didn't feel cared for by him. I felt hurt after this visit; however, I will take his care plan seriously and follow it, though I will be asking to be seen by someone else.|After my mom saw this doctor she was traumatized. Each time she would go she seemed apprehensive to go back. After her last visit I'm very concerned as to what went on. I have no idea what he did to her because whenever I ask she just cries and says he's not a nice Doctor. Almost as if she's afraid of him. She refuses to go back. I've never seen my mom so shaken up about anything. Very concerning that this man cares for many patients who are dealing with chronic pain and vulnerable.|Kind and understanding staff.  Dr Guernelli and Kristen Schroeder provide excellent care without judgement.  They are up to date on new treatments and practices to alleviate pain.  I would reccomend this practice to anyone who experiences chronic pain.|I have found Dr Perkowski to be very helpful in reducing my pain and improving my quality of life.

Almost a year ago they were scheduled to be his Anesthesiologist for a surgery. Who showed up late, gave unsolicited medical observations after a short (5 mins) look over. Then left and they had to use somebody else to do it pushing the surgery back over 2 hours.

Then today the 19th was meant to be seen here for consultation for pain management. Never saw us and called to cancel the appointment 10 minutes before it was scheduled to start. We were already in the waiting room when they called to cancel.

EDIT:  I just saw her in the local hospital for anesthesia and she tried to tell me things about my own medical history based on her 10-second ""exam"" of looking at me.  I told her I have a weak jaw bone and was told this by previous oral surgeons and to be careful of that.  She dismissed this saying ""I don't think you do,"" because I also happen to have TMJ.  As though you cannot have both.  She made me wait 45 mins extra for no reason only to be given a much nicer person to do the job for her.  Truly an awful Dr. and person and I hope I never see her again.  She is probably racist or something because I'm black and she doesn't treat all of her patients equally.  She's borderline delusional giving out medical advice OUTSIDE of her field UNPROMPTED.  If I could give a negative rating I would.  She should have her license revoked.  Stay away from this woman.

I've had chronic pain since 1997 and in 2011 I wanted to try and manage my pain without meds. After eight months it was clear that it wasn't  working, that medication was needed, and eventhough Dr. Hull had promised that he would put me back on medication if unsuccessful, he refused. Eventually his nurse practitioner (my main provider) insisted that I get medication again because my situation was so bad.  Also, I kept hearing from them how great their pain center was, how they were setting up a program to include PT, OT, psychology, exercise, etc...did not see it in the 1.5 years I was a patient. All I got was one visit a month where I would talk to the practitioner and they gave me referrals for injections that I knew would not work.  I don't recommend to anyone.|I saw Dr Hull back in January of 2016 I had then been thru 5 surgeries on my  Back which were unsuccessful  I was in so much pain ,I sat down after he reviewed my MRI.  He told me that I see you should be under care for your pain and be on pain meds BUT I'm not doing that instead I'm recommending you come off everything. I asked about a back stimulator, and asked about my fusions and if they are fused .He told me nothing will help now.  I have never seen such a rude and uncaring Dr in my life. Since that time I went to Boston as the pain was overwhelming.The first Dr I saw looked at my MRI and told me you have several surgical problems that need to be taken care of.My other fusions never fused.The bolts in my back were entirely loose .I had bone spurs ,and some Disk left in there . I had a 9 hour surgery in Boston.This Dr told me ,all of the work he had to do. This was the same MRI I had taken  to Dr Hull . It's not just the Extreme rudeness, Its the fact he cannot read an MRI or he read it and did not care . He is not fit to be a pain Dr. When Boston read his report on me, They agreed.|My name is John and I have seen Dr. Hull for the past five years. This Dr is the most compassionate Dr I know. When I read a few reviews above I was shocked for those statements are pure false..... This Dr. goes above and beyond to care for you. Believe me when I say you are not just a number with him. He cares about your overall health and not just your pain. If you are having other complications he will guide you in the right direction.... I just had to say something for this man really cares for you. Lastly I think he has a photographic memory for he knows stuff about me that we talked about months or years earlier. You want an excellent Dr go see him.....

Sincerely,

John H. R|Dr. Stephen Hull is among the very few exemplary doctors I've ever had, and as a PTSD chronic pain patient, I've had many many doctors over the past thirty years. Dr. Hull is a treasure. His knowledge of medicine, the broad range of drugs and their appropriate applications, and the physiology of pain and how we experience it, is encyclopedic. His program at the pain clinic at Mercy Hospital, provides specific and practical tools for understanding pain, and for managing it, to the purpose of participating in life more fully. I'd been trying to get rid of my pain for years, trying literally dozens of treatment modalities with no success. In the year and a half that I've been part of Dr. Hull's program, (classes
twice a week and support/discussion group once a week), my life has expanded exponentially. I still have some pain, but Dr. Hull has enabled me to have a rich and rewarding life anyhow.

In the course of this journey, Dr. Hull has demonstrated over and over, his respect for his patients and for our struggles. He is open about his own efforts to manage pain, and is in effect part of his own program. He sets a good example for the rest of us. His personal and professional integrity, as I have witnessed these last eighteen months, are beyond reproach. I have been shocked to read the disparaging remarks some people have posted about him. I hope they find relief somewhere, but I think Dr. Hull is
not the appropriate target for their disappointment. I am deeply grateful for what he has given me, and continues to give.
John Skeen, Portland, ME.|Don't waste your time! Worst Dr ever.  I made it clear I do not want opioids. I do however want to try meds for nerve pain (my ortho has said I am having nerve pain). He continues to promise, but always has some excuse for not giving them. His nurse made it quite clear he won't give me the meds unless I join his support group. This is blackmail and totally unprofessional.|I call him Dr. Hell.
I will start by letting you know that finding a doctor to treat my condition was not easy. I had been bounced around by one doctor to another to get help. Keep in mind I didn't ask for this help. I have been to an osteopathic surgeon (7 yrs or more with him, I felt as tho I could trust him and he began prescribing me pain meds for my back and neck  and I liked him as a Dr. and When he found out that I had a herniated disc in my neck He sent me to a neurological surgeon and she took over the prescription.
I didn't understand why I had such pain in my back! I thought it was my oversized breasts so I scheduled a reduction and it didn't help! I went to the tummy tuck and that Didn't help! All the while
I'm getting these surgeries done I'm asking myself,"" why aren't they doing an MRI of my spine to figure out what's going on instead of letting me get these  very invasive  surgeries done?""
Neither surgery helped.
I called my neurosurgeon,  because I had to get a refill of my Vicodin and as I'm talking to her nurse she started grilling me on where I have been getting my medication.. I'm thinking she has my chart in front of her before opening her mouth! To be judged like that or talk to you in such an accusatory tone didn't sit well with me so I had it out with the nurse. My snarky reply,"" I had a refill""! Did you perhaps notice that while looking at my chart? Nope! So when I go to the office of this Dr. at Maine neuro and we discussed what took place between her nurse and myself  she apologized for the reaction and behavior of her nurse but that's it!  I got squeezed out and the nurse got to keep her position .
This doctor that I have been with and trusted for 3 years is now kicking me to the curb but in a way that won't be noticeable so I can't report her and is setting me up to be with DR.HELL!
The moment I walked into this office I wasn't treated as a chronic pain patient, I was treated as an addict. We have meeting & he decides to put me on methadone & Vicodin! Talk about someone being very sick... Each medication he would put me on made me sicker and sicker because I am very sensitive  to a lot of medications not just opiates but SSRIs as well!
So on our first visit common protocol is to take a urine test and I think nothing of it because I am not into Coke or heroin or anything illicit!  I leave this office with my prescription and go home. I going to see him about a week later and he asked me some questions and then asked me where I got the Percocet from. Now keep in mind that I am no doctor nor am I a medical assistant or a pharmaceutical representative. Also,  I won't remember the one Percocet I took two weeks after I took it because to me I'm not doing anything sneaky or wrong. I didn't know that it was any different than the Vicodin and I had asked someone if I could have one of theirs because I didn't have any for the appointment that day and it was late in the day. So I'm not going to abscess about one little pill that I took that I thought had no bearing on my urine test whatsoever! So when he asked me where I got it I honestly couldn't remember. Dr. hell told me to ""go home and think of another LIE  and EXCUSE better than the one I just gave him! I WASNT lying and that's what piissed me off!
He's obviously dealt with some massive pill heads in the past but I'm not one!
I go home called my mom in NH and I told her what happened and we put our heads together and we realized that I took one of her pills and that's what showed up in my urine!
He excepted that but didn't believe me so at This point it was incredibly difficult  to call and ask for a refill. He would say things like call me in a couple of days and I'll let you know how I feel and maybe I'll fill it maybe I'm I won't!  Maybe I'll tell you one thing and then I'll tell you another. I was a nervous wreck every time I had to deal with him. I was honest with him and I wasn't going to lie just to make the truth sound plausible. It's like the cops making you admit to doing a crime that you Didn't do. He crude & rude.|With fibromyalgia he pushed me to exercise through the pain, causing more long term pain.

Met with Brigham Mckenny   he had a cancellation that day and said he though he could help me with my pain. I was in the office 3 hours they drew blood and worked their magic injected 5 shots into my shoulder some discomfort . took advil when I got home. Told me to not lift weights for a couple days. the next day I had a lot of relief.and it got better daily.Very happy with the out come.
.|I received regenerative therapy for my knee and it's the best treatment so far to alleviate the night pains from arthritis. I did this treatment instead of the recommended partial knee replacement. I was going to have to cancel all my planned hikes for the summer. Thanks to  QC Kinetix regenerative therapy, not only was I able to continue to hike 4000' Mountain Peaks all summer and fall, I had NO Night Knee pain after a hike. Game Changer!! I couldn't be happier. Thanks for getting me back to doing what I love to do.|I went to QC Kinetix about a year ago now. I had been told by my doctors that I needed 2 knee replacements. My right knee had already had one arthroscopic surgery a few years before. I didn't want the knee replacements at all. I bit the $$ bullet and decided to try QC Kinetix after my sister-in-law said it was working wonders for her. I am so glad I did. I feel like I have a quality of life back again. I can walk around with out all that pain. One knee is like its old self. The worst knee can still bother me a bit on cold rainy days but nothing in comparison to how they were before. Being able to walk normally again, I can move more, losing some weight too so that is a great bonus from moving more! I recommend this to anyone who might want to opt out from joint replacements. Worth every penny! Insurance providers are nuts for not covering this.|Great staff!  Everyone is very professional, knowledgeable and take the time to explain the procedure.  Went to QC Kinetix because Dr. Herzog had been my doctor for a few years before he closed his private practice.   I am a believer in stem cell rejuvenation.  Dr. Herzog's great reputation as a doctor and surgeon made me feel comfortable with the procedure.  The doctor makes the all the difference.  My pain (hip & sacrum) was noticeably less after the first treatment.  By the end of the treatments my discomfort was gone.  Five months later I feel even better.  It does take time for the stem cells to do their job.  Thank you Dr. John Herzog!!!|I injured my left shoulder in college playing football. It was a partial separation, and as I had earned a starting position as a freshman I didn't tell anyone as I didn't want to loose my starting position . It is now 48 years after that injury. I have suffered through pain and an inability in sleep on my left side for years.
I went to QC Kinetix in hopes they might be the answer to my chronic pain . The initial visit, that was a free evaluation was eye opening . Dr. Herzog , as well as one of his assistants informed me that they turn away more than half the potential clients if they felt there would be no benefit to the procedure. I appreciated their honesty, as it reminded me of the way I run my business , A-BEST Window.
Upon the initial scan, Dr. Herzog saw quite a substantial amount of arthritis. He indicated that their procedures made me a good candidate. My injections were scheduled and let me tell you the results!
Even though it's only been a little over a month after the 5th injection I am pain free in my left shoulder snd can sleep on both sides for the first time in decades. The other positive thing is that Dr. Herzog said there will be continued benefits through the rejuvenative treatments for months to come .
I would highly recommend going to see if QC Kinetixs would be the answer for you if you are experiencing arthritic pain and you felt the only option was surgery . What have you got to loose? The initial consultation is free! The answer to ""what have you got to loose"" is the pain you've been suffering with for years . Jim Soule  Woolwich, Maine|I suffered with lateral knee pain and after x-rays and an MRI my doctors could not see why I was in so much pain. I do have mild arthritis but they told me it should not be causing that much pain and that I was too young for knee replacements. I heard the ad for QC Kinetix and thought I'd give it a try. I had results with the first plasma injections! I just finish the process and couldn't be happier. I walk better, can get up and down from the floor, go up and down stairs faster and put pressure on my knees to get up and down. I would definitely recommend making an appointment for a free consultation!|Brought my mom here after trying a few other clinics in and out of state to treat her hip, back and shoulder pain. From the get-go the staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home. Dr. Herzog, Leigh the attending nurse and the rest of the staff are really friendly, kind and knowledgeable. They presented us with different treatment options to treat her pain. She underwent Plasma/PRP and Laser treatment for two sessions, and a week after our second visit my mother was able to walk without using her cane, go up and down a flight of stairs, stand for longer periods of time and even dance with me and my sisters for Christmas. My mom is very satisfied with the results so far. Thanks QC Kinetix!|I am no longer is constant discomfort. I just finished my 5th shot ( last of the series), so I've not completed my healing phase.

I was unable to pick up anything the slightest heavy, could not open jars, and the worst was that I could not pick up my grandchildren. QC Kinetix was the best thing to happen to me.

Sleeping, numbing hands, pain at like 8 on 9 all day for 10 years. No insurance and no real option to get better, until a buddie told me about QC. After the 4th injection I was almost a real boy again. Never missed a day of work. I do drywall so it's super easy on the body and the shoulder especially. But just had the final injection and am beyond happy with the outcome. Basically 0 pain like I don't even remember what it felt like anymore. Increasing mobility and strength with the help of YouTube and some rubber bands. I'm only 40 and was told it's good I'm getting here early well I wish I'd have done it 8 years ago so don't wait just go it's a fraction of surgery and basically a poke and a Bandaid. Little sore the day after but I was looking foward to it after the healing began. Thank you Brigg|Hello - My name is Daniel, I went to QC Kinetix because of my knees.  Osteroarthritis in both knees.  I am done with the whole procedure and my knees are at about 95 %.  The whole experience was made relatively painless by the great staff.  Leigh, Elizabeth and the others get a huge pat on the back and a hug from this grateful person.  They are all quite good at doing what there are doing, and I highly recommend seeing them far before costly and painful surgery.  A big hug and kiss to all the ladies at QC Kinetix (Freeport).

I am so happy. I have felt better with each steroid injection. I have complete trust in his care.       The staff is just wonderful too. They are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable every time I visit. Its so nice to still have a doc that listens. Thanks to all!|I was referred to Dr. Greenspan by my primary care doctor. Thank god! Dr. Greenspan is a very thorough professional. He listened to my issues and my needs. LISTENED! I have had 3 pain management doctors since 2004. Ranging from 'OK"" to purely unethical...

Dr. Greenspan is amazing. He did not stigmatize me. He did not judge me. In this day of mismanagement of pain patients, he gave me the care that was appropriate for me.

Dr. Greenspan is going after the causes of my pain, not just masking it. He wants me to be pain free, not just throw pills at me, keeping me and my insurance paying into his pockets. As such he has referred me to outside specialists to fully determine the causes of my pain. With those test results in hand, we are in the process of figuring out the way to best alleviate my symptoms.

If you are trying to just get high, abuse some pain prescription, or just want an easy way out of your issue, this is NOT the place to be.

This practice is professional and follows not just legal or medical guidelines, but is ethical in their treatment.

The nurses and office staff are discreet, caring, and knowledgeable.

For best results, come here!|I have been going to Dr Greenspan who is upfront about getting relief from the excruciating pain I was suffering from.  The first three Epidurals did very little for me but the first one of the second round did the trick and I have been completely pain free for 6 weeks. I have to mention the ladies at the front desk are wonderful and caring. Dr. Greenspan is very gentle and I feel like I have my life back being able to do the everyday things.  Thanks Doc|Personally, I find Dr. Greenspan to be caring and truly interested in I you have to say. As a doctor, he is very competent, knowledgeable and he takes the time to determine what procedure will work best for YOU, as an individual, with your unique medical issues. He is also very patient and takes the time to make sure you absolutely understand what the course of treatment will be by putting all medical jargon into layman's terms. Dr. Greenspan has helped me deal with my spine issues, as well as how best to give me relief.  In addition, the staff is class A, from the receptionist to the medical assistants. I am so happy to have found him and am certain my quality of life will improve because of him.|I have been going to Dr.Greenspan since 2014. He is one of the most caring compassionate doctors that I have ever met and very thorough he actually does his job and tackles the pain problems you have at hand he has done so much for me over these years I couldn't ask for a better doctor. not to mention a few years back I broke my foot and I was having trouble getting the medicine that I needed it was late at night on his day off he answered the phone and he took care of everything for me not a lot of doctors do that kind of thing. So if you need help with your pain management and you're open to all options American pain Institute is the place to go. I now see the physician assistant Kevin which is just as good as Dr. Greenspan I wouldn't change my doctors for the World. Also everyone in the office is very helpful for professional and very nice. Thanks So Much for helping me in life with my care. You guys are the best!|I have been a patient of Dr. Lehns for a close to a year. I am very grateful for his help. I can now play with my dog and have also stopped smoking marijuana. My quality of life is increased 10 fold. I have also gained a healthy amount of weight as my food now tastes better since stopping marijuana. I am so glad to have found him. I also appreciate his wonderful staff. They are very efficient and take care of me well.|Dr. Greenspan has literally changed my life.  He and his entire staff are always so happy and such a pleasure to be around.  His knowledge and expertise is far greater than any other Doctor I have seen prior to him, and the fact that he makes it a point that you understand how much he truly cares about YOU makes my overall experience with him beyond perfect!!|My experience has been next to amazing. The initial walk in was enlightening, everything you would not expect from a doctors office.  My first thought was, 'this can't be a doctors office, I must be in the wrong place.

It is what you would expect from an art gallery, not a doctors office. The waiting room has the most comfortable chairs with  impeccable decor and the lighting through out the entire facility.

If you are like me and have the dreadful experience of a drab dark and unkempt Dr office for years, then I strongly advise to give them a visit. I can promise, you will never go back to the drab. The pain institute puts most hospitals to shame with their advanced technology.

The staff is knowledgeable, respectful, I'm not some number waiting in line at the deli counter for my lunch meats. The patient rooms are soothing and inviting, not dirty and gloomy. Bathrooms are impeccably clean with warm colors and lighting, the same you would find in a 5 start hotel.

Each room is numbered by white led glass wall sconces. Recovery room, Yes! They have a recovery room..the chairs you relax in during recovery, is something you may find at a brookstone.

Dr Greenspan is the model for all doctors, knowledgeable, personable, innovative, and most importantly, he treats you like a person, not a paycheck as most have come accustom to. It has been close to one year since my first visit, and since then, my quality of life from the chronic pain and illness has improved by 80%. Everyone has different situations, some more difficult than others.

I was at the breaking point with my pain and quality of my life was at an all time low. Doctor after Doctor, hospitals that claim to be pain management but treated me like a washed up nobody, they made me feel guilty because I was in pain and needed help, almost as if I was faking it just to get medication.

Dr Greenspan made me feel comfortable, I did not feel like a nobody seeking medications, I felt assured, someone finally! Understands me, Finally there is hope and it's not all in my head.

Moving forward..Dr Greenspan found the problem to my chronic pain and conditions. I followed his advice and treatments, had surgery the same day, and today I am able to live a better quality of life with less pain.

I have a little ways to go still, but I know it will only get better. I am forever thankful to Dr Greenspan and American pain Institute and all the great staff. Had I continued on that road I was on with assumptions and getting shifted around with Doctors and hospitals telling me, ""It's all in your head"", I would not be in the happy place I am today.

Thanks,

My pain and discomfort level had dropped considerably since I made the appointment. Yet he was understanding with my following thru with my appointment regardless.Professional, personal, attentive and reassuring. He acknowledged  I was heading in the healing direction and to keep moving forward with my self-care, and to check back with the office in a month. Wonderful office staff also.|I absolutely love everyone at Pain Specialty Group, especially Dr. Gno. He tries to find ways of longer lasting relief for my pain, instead of just throwing pills at me like previous doctors at different places. He has an excellent group of staff all like minded. They put the patient first. I trust everyone there.|Dr Ngo and the entire staff are a great professional team. Looking forward to my upcoming appointments with them. They are all understanding and listen to the concerns I had. I would highly recommend them to anyone who's in pain and need help!!!|The dr spent extremely little time with me and did not listen in the most elemental ways. There seemed to be an assumption that I would be seeking narcotics, which I was not. The dr had not reviewed records that I sent ahead of time and despite my telling him repeatedly that I had sent them already, told the front desk person to order my records. The whole experience was dehumanizing and just strange and unhelpful and rushed. I moved from another state where pain management was handled much more professionally and respectfully.|Dr. Ngo and Josh, his PA, are wonderful. They are incredibly knowledgeable, very thorough, and genuinely empathetic to my husband's medical conditions. We would highly recommend this practice.|My appointment was timely and convenient.  The staff is helpful and pleasant and Dr. Ngo was prompt, addressed all of my concerns, explained his plan of action for me and entertained any and all questions.  It was good, not to feel rushed.
During my procedure Dr. Ngo and staff were extremely attentive, checking constantly about pain level which was minimal.  Truly a compassionate individual.|Dr. Ngo is without a doubt the best pain specialist I have EVER seen. I've been going to different specialists all over New England for over 15 years. No one even comes close. From the ambience of walking into a clean, tranquil waiting room with pleasant music playing, to being greeted with a smile by each and every employee I have interacted with. Unlike many places that take a one size fits all approach, Dr. Ngo and his expert team of Doctors and PAs create a bespoke approach for each and everyone of their patients. They take the time to see how you are doing every single visit. You aren't rushed at all unlike what I have experienced at many other practices. They have gotten me as close to pain free as I have been in over 15 years through a variety of treatments. Don't hesitate to give them a try. Other people I have talked to who see them drive several hours for one visit, just like me. That's because they are the BEST!!! Dr. Ngo is a phenomenal Doctor and an intelligent, kind, generous individual. The same goes for Bobby his Office Manager, Dr. Robertson, Josh, and the rest of the staff at Pain Speciality Group.

Thank you all for helping me to be able to enjoy spending time with the people I love and keep doing the things I find fulfilling. I wouldn't be able to do it without each one of you!|Dr. Ngo and his medical staff are highly professional, proactive, patient-centric, and flexible.

While every one I've ever dealt with in their practices have been kind and helpful, they even go above and beyond my prior experiences with the practice. Everyone from the front office staff, to the people checking you in taking blood pressure etc, and of course the Nurse practitioner or Dr are kind, helpful, and also efficient. I had a couple new things this visit, met another staff member and forgive me I can't remember her name (it started with an M.) She met with me first to go over a couple things. First was a new App they have you down load and help you get set up there. This is to check in daily with them, just a few easy questions, but then also will have the ability to ask questions or make requests through the app so if you need anything you can just add it while doing your daily check in and they'll get back or follow up with what is needed. I love this as you don't have to call and it sounds like it will streamline getting assistance from them without having to sit on hold or call multiple times as it is with some Dr's offices I visit. So they are proactively making their practice even more efficient and patient friendly. She also had me do a new test which involved blood pressure cuffs on your 4 limbs and an oxygen meter. The Staff member was kind and considerate, making me feel comfortable and not rushed at all and not even worried if I wasn't able to do everything necessary due to pain and mobility issues. So aside from the usual easy, friendly, and quick in and out appointment, they continue to add new technology to make the patients lives a little easier. I've been going to pain management on and off for 20 years with the latest practice change due to insurance not covering my old Dr, and I can honestly say while I had no problems with past practices, the people at PASS Maryland and the ststem they have set up really has been the best overall experience from any pain management clinic I've been to. Thank you for helping keep my quality of life at an acceptable level especially during these cold months which are by far the worst for me.|Expert and professional staff.  I have been working with this office for over 6 years and I have always been treated in a professional and caring manner.

This practice is  modern and very much up to date on the latest developments and treatments.

They also have developed new technique's, new treatment's, and devices which have been adopted throughout the medical community.

I would always highly recommend this office to anyone that requires treatment for their own health needs.|The receptionist presents a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Waiting times are minimal. Nurses are exceptionally friendly they explain everything they will be doing to prepare you to see your doctor. Once Dr. J walks in the room he also presents a very calming atmosphere he explained all the recent results of my previous weeks testing such as nerve and balance testing results he answered all my questions regarding the test results and offered up information on where I could get help with improving the test results. This company is top notch when it comes to critical spine care and explains all the latest procedures that would help you in your pain management journey. Thanks to everyone there involved with my care. I really appreciate each and everyone of you. Thank you all.|If you are looking for a place where professionalism and expertise are valuable to address your pain problems , this is the place to go. Chrissy very clearly communicated to me the details of my issues and the treatments  that I need . I have surgeries coming but while waiting, I am getting better sleep following the physical therapy they recommend along with the right medications. I know what they are doing is right. In my previous doctors, they just keep injecting me with steroids until they are not working anymore. Thank you Pain and Spine Specialists of MD! Highly recommended!|I'm treated with dignity and respect. The appointment is fast and efficient. Everyone that works there is very kind and caring. I'm very grateful for the people at pain and spine specialist. My appointments are always comforting. I've always been a little anxious going to doctors appointments but not here. Again I'm very grateful to everyone one at pain and spine specialist.|Great experience for me as a new patient best doctors office I've been to in the past 3 years.

Doctor was clear about what my options are and allowed me to tell him what's going on and answer my questions with clarity HIGHLY RECOMMEND|Definitely one of the best practices I've ever been to. I would recommend this place to anyone. Especially people that are over 65 and have been cut off because of Medicare or Medicare. It took me a long time to find a doctor who would accept me and treat me with my pain medication.|This office saved my life!!!
I've had CRPS for 8 years. Even with countless medications, treatments, specialist and doctors it was still very poorly managed. My daily pain was a 10+ moving was hard life seemed impossible. Although I had reached the end of the scope of practice of many doctors before I still carried hope there was a doctor out there who would listen. Then I found pain and spine specialist and it changed my life forever. My very first appointment I felt heard. For the first time in 8 years there was genuine empathy, and honesty about my condition. Everyone in this office makes me feel comfortable and cared for. Every Doctor and P.A. I've seen has listened to my probelms and worked with me to come up with a solution. My daily pain level is down to a 6, I can get around much better and even play with my kids.

I was greeted with a warm welcome during each stage, from Tiffany (check-in), Reggie (medical asst), and by Dr. Irwin. Tiffany was very professional and explained everything that was required at check-in for the initial visit. Their sign in process using the office tablet worked great  and is the way to go I must say. After completing check-in, Reggie led me to the exam room where she was very efficient in taking my vital signs and preparing additional paperwork that was needed. Finally, the care that I received from Dr. Irwin was outstanding. She explained my symptoms by using a visual aid which greatly helped me to understand my current condition, and the treatment plan going forward. I'm highly confident that I'll be back (no pun intended) to enjoying my active lifestyle again by following Dr. Irwin's recommend treatment plan. I highly recommend Dr. Irwin and her staff at Clearway Pain Solutions. Definitely 5 Stars!|My first visit- A very kind and cheerful front office staff.

I was prescribed a medication that my pharmacist recommended I not take since it is another in a long list of medications that I take that cause dry mouth. had Dr Irwin taken proper time to talk to me and tell me about any potential side effects of the medication she was prescribing we could have had a conversation. instead I will not be taking the medication and I will be finding a doctor that actually gives me a full appointment.|This practice is user friendly from the doctor, Anna Irwin, to every member of the staff...nurses and receptionists.

They deserve recognition for the incredible work they do to help their patients.
Initially, I was hesitant to share this review because I didn't want anything to change the smooth and efficient experience I've had. Unlike many other pain management clinics, where you might wait up to an hour to be seen, my provider, Jay, ensures that appointments run on time. Jay is a true professional with a caring and positive attitude--something that's rare in this field. The level of consideration and respect for patients here is exceptional, especially compared to other places where long wait times are the norm. It's refreshing and much appreciated! Hopefully, this review will not bring in too many patients at once; however, I'm sure they will be able to keep up with patient demand , so I'm not too worried about it.
I want to add one more thought about pain management clinics. I've been to four different pain management clinics in the past 15 years. Throughout those years, I've had many operations, and you often need your pain medication adjusted for the procedures you're undergoing. The problem I encountered at three of the previous clinics was a lack of communication between staff and doctors. This led to errors in providing the proper dosage or adjusting prescriptions appropriately based on my procedures.
Elkridge Pain & Spine Center is awesome! I had been putting off my back operation because I was afraid of the pain level and not receiving proper medication from previous clinics. After seeing a review about Elkridge Pain & Spine Center, I decided to give them a try--and now I'm writing my own review because they deserve to be recognized!|Great people very caring and understanding I am well treated and they take the time to ask a lot of questions. I have been to several pain management places and this is by far the best .

I do hate the turnover with the front office staff!!! I have had appointments at all the locations since 2016 .

That to me is being concerned. I  would give him a 10, since we talk about numbers of pain always. I use to go to Glen Burnie  office but it closed down, so I have to go to the Elkridge office, but it's not a problem. I'm giving photos of myself with my brothers trying to be happy about their life. The other picture is my father holding me as he was building  our home that I  grew  up in.

The front desk staff were very polite and friendly as well.

However, I received the bill today for my visits earlier in the year, and it seems the only way to pay is with a credit card, where I have to either mail back the bill with my credit card information written on it, which presents a huge risk if the mail gets lost for whatever reason, or I have to come in to the office in order to pay. They're not able to take my card number over the phone for some reason and now that the Columbia office is temporarily closed with no definite date for reopening, I have to go all the way to Pasadena office during my work day, which is very inconvenient. We live in 2024 and I believe that there should be either an online billing system where we're able to enter information securely or at least pay over phone.

I've never had a doctor listen to my issues like Dr. Wasserman. During your appointment you have his full attention and he makes sure to ask about everything, even things that you did not think could be related to your problem, and is therefore able to make linkages and diagnoses that other doctors miss. I had severe pain in my hips and back that my GP could not fix (and did not seem particularly interested in fixing because he did not seem to think it was real). After seeing Dr. Wasserman for four months, the pain is gone most days. I have lived with the pain for years and did not know it could feel this good. I also like that Dr. Wasserman always endeavors to find the least amount of medication that will give me a good result, the most efficient treatment with the least number of side effects. I would definitely recommend this practice to anyone in pain that doesn't know where to turn.|I have suffered with Migraines for over 50 years, gradually transitioning from Occasional, to Episodic, to Chronic, to Chronic Daily.  During that process my use of Pain Management Meds changed from OTC NSAID's, to Opioids.  Their increasing frequency lead to Rebounding or MOH (Medication Overuse Headache).  My previous Pain Management Doctor had me using ""old school"" Pain Meds, and I found myself in a vicious downward spiral.  That dreaded day occurred, he retired and dissolved his practice.  My search for a new Doctor lead me to a Migraine Specialists, who with highest recommendations referred me to Dr. Wasserman for Pain Management.

Dr. Wasserman is focus driven, first gathering the pertinent background information and details regarding my Migraines.  We had an in-depth discussion of my current situation, medications used, and how the unrelenting chronic pain was in total control of my life.  He listened attentively to my concerns, frustrations, and hopeful objectives.  He explained in detail how my current traditional pain treatment program was doomed from the start.  Dr. Wasserman developed a new tactical approach for my pain management.  We started down a new path on a treatment program that could be tailored over time to my specific needs.  He was very careful and methodical to ramp the dose up gradually and observe any potential side effects.

The Pain Management program Dr. Wasserman put me on has made a significant and profound change in the quality of life I have now.  My wife is also very grateful for the marked improvement.  It's a Win-Win all around.  I am ecstatic that Opioids and their long term detrimental effects are no longer part of my daily routine.  Dr. Wasserman truly cares about his patients, their wellbeing, and their quality of life.  His extensive knowledge and years of experience treating complex pain management conditions is unequaled.  Julia, his support staff is top notch, there to provide first class assistance and support as needed, and you can contact him on his personal cell phone if needed.  You won't find a better Pain Management Doctor to work with.|No one likes dealing with pain, and the whole prospect can become overwhelming unless you find effective treatment guided by an effective specialist. Dr,Wasserman is just that. His expertise, while focused on pain management, recognizes that pain is a multi causal thing and requires a multi prong approach. From sleep, to weight loss, to physical therapy, to an improved medication regimen....Dr.Wasserman has addressed comprehensive treatment of all these contributing factors and is having tremendous success. His common sense no  nonsense approach is refreshing and results driven. You owe it to yourself to schedule an appointment with him and experience the difference for yourself.|Dr Wasserman is the best of the best! He saved my life. I was at the lowest point in my life before I came to his practice as a patient. Seven years later and I am now working full time, enjoying my family and most importantly, love myself again. He is creative and truly cares what is best for his patients. I have been to many doctors and hospitals in my life and have never found anyone in the entire field of medicine who truly listens to patients with chronic pain issues the way Dr Wasserman does. My first appointment with him lasted over 3 hours if that says anything. Thanks Doc for all you have done for me and my family. We are truly blessed to have you in our lives.|I have been a patient of Dr. Wasserman for over ten years. He takes more time with patients than any other doctor I've ever been to. He listens, and works with you to figure out the best way forward. He constantly looks for ways to improve your outcome.

He keeps up with the latest research and developments in the field of pain treatment, and uses that knowledge to ensure patients are getting the best possible course of treatment. We have worked together to minimize medication and maximize my ability to maintain an active lifestyle. I highly recommend Dr. Wasserman.|I have been a patient of Dr Justin Wasserman, MD. For over 12 years. I have a very complex medical history one of which is I am a Liver transplant patient who suffers from CRPS know as RSD in my right hand. Many surgeries and medical incisions throughout my body. RSD can follow from your original form of injury and can effect any additional injuries to one's body from having additional surgeries. Dr. Wasserman is an expert in chronic pain management. He's always available if I should need to have additional surgeries he's always  involved with my other doctors. If I should have a flair up in-between my office visit his very quick in responding back to me to assist me. He is the my 2nd Pain Management Doctor who I have been working with since my first doctor had retired. I value he's knowledge, expertise and compassion as he is always willing to listen. Being a chronic pain patient is a difficult disease to live with. There is no cure for these neurological injuries. As well as no one treatment for each person. I have the utmost respect for Dr. Wasserman in how he manages to help me with this complex pain syndrome. He helps make life easier to work with my pain to have a life worth living.
Dr.Justin Wasserman is a valuable part of my life and my medical Care in conjunction with several other medical professionals in which at times it's essential that he is part of that team. In working with my other specialist doctors that I see on a regular basis. I highly Recommend Dr Justin Wasserman MD to anyone who is in need of chronic pain management. FYI. Please confirm threw his office if you need to have a referral prior to making an appointment.

Stay safe wear masks!|As a clinical research professional, I've worked with numerous physicians over my 20 year career, and as a chronic pain sufferer I've also been a patient. Dr. Wasserman is the real deal. Very few physicians have his high level of ability combined with ethical standards and compassionate care. He was able to accurately diagnose my long standing pain condition that over a dozen other physicians had missed or improperly diagnosed. Before I was (finally) referred to Dr. Wasserman by another pain specialist, I'd spent the better part of 5 years and lots of money trying to find someone who would get it right. Once we had the diagnosis, he worked with me extensively to find the right non-opioid medications, titrate them appropriately so I could tolerate increasing doses, and address each symptom of my complex condition in turn. Over 18 months or so, we arrived the right balance of as little medication as possible to keep my symptoms at bay. He's meticulous in his exploration and takes copious notes that allow him to refer back to previous visits. His knowledge of pain medications and their effects is encyclopedic, and he keeps up with all the latest medical research, which not a lot of physicians bother to do. I highly recommend Dr. Wasserman to anyone struggling with chronic pain; he'll help you get it sorted out so you can live your best life.|When I first met Dr. Wasserman over a year ago, I was in daily crippling pain from cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis). He was referred to me by my primary care doctor. In our first meeting and every meeting since, Dr. Wasserman has been an intense investigator, rigorously searching for causes behind my symptoms. He possesses a sincere willingness to listen as well as an intense desire to search for details that allows him to develop a personalized treatment plan. I continue to have monthly follow-up treatment.

Moreover, Dr. Wasserman and his associate have been very welcoming to me. They are also attentive to me in terms of scheduling appointments as well as in terms of communications.",2023-12-13|2023-08-07|2024-01-18|2020-01-28|2019-06-22|2020-10-09|2019-04-27|2022-08-31,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Can the doctor  prescribe subutex or just suboxone ...???","Hi.  Thanks for asking the question.  I do prescribe subutex in appropriate cases.  Every patient is different, and all treatment for any patient with chronic pain must be individualized.

My first appointment was at the Columbia office and it is a brand new location but it seems like I can't get a appointment at the Cattonsville office. I guess it's more patients in the Baltimore county area than Anne Arundel county. However if I can always have my appointment with Ms. Rachel Whitley I don't mind traveling out there, even though it's about a 30 minute drive. She doesn't just talk to you and the appointment is over, she actually listens to your concerns and gets you on track to get the correct treatment such as braces for your back leg etc when most providers I have been to just rushes the appointment and doesn't listen to the patient concerns. They just come into the room and refills med's and on to the next patient. Not asking you if you may need any other treatment than just meds. G.M.P.M opens doors for a whole other treatment options than only meds such as physical therapy, and different types of tests to better your health. Ms. Rachel Whitley wants to know what helps you and what doesn't.

There's a Right & Wrong to do things just like a Professional & Unprofessional way to work your job..

Ladies be Professional in all that you do. Your apart of a Medical Team and should know better. And, if a Patient is not sure about a process, it is your job to explain things and not assume that the patients already know your process.

So now I get no meds for the holidays while entertaining two toddlers. 2 weeks without meds unless I physically go there to get it straight.  I have a spinal cord injury and am now in a wheelchair.   I guess on the second I have to load up the wheelchair and unload it again to roll in there and get it straight.  I couldnt imagine still being in the work force and dealing with mistake after mistake frim your doctor AND having to leave work to get it fixed because its almost impossible to get someone on the phone. I've had no issues with Dr Henry and every interaction has been positive and very respectful. Grade A on him.   The rest hasn't been pleasant.|I have only had a few bad experiences there. They were with Tish. She always has an attitude and talks to everyone else while she should have her attention on the patient in front of her. I do not like that. There was one day I had an early appointment bc I worked from 10p-7a, I was getting an injection in my lower back. The whole time I was waiting NO ONE told me I was an hour early for my appointment. She also when she is giving appointment cards doesn't circle what the appointment is a follow up or procedure.|I love this practice. Dr. Henry is very attentive to his patients and I'm so happy I found him. Excellent pain provider.|I get excellent service. Everyone is cordial,  and though they have a lot of patients,  they remember me including the doctor. Sometimes the wait is long,  but they are getting better about that.|My care at pain and wellness center has been really good.The staff are accomodating and personable,the wait minimal.Dr.Henry is warm,intelligent,and very helpful.For the past 2yrs.lve had spinal pain 10 most of the time.More recent cancer of the head and neck pain before and after tx.ongoing.Without the help from this great clinic,my life and lifestyle would be unbearable!! Thank God !!|Dr Henry is great the staff not so much no phone calls that my appt was cancelled I'm been a patient there for yrs and front desk girls not doing there job haven't been  seen weeks before Xmas and final get my appt in the second week of January and go in just get told you are cancelled today with no call message nothing just told one of girls called me I said no call to me was made then told o sorry maybe they forgot so looks like look for a better place for treatment",2024-10-22|2022-03-16|2024-12-27|2021-12-02|2025-02-04|2024-11-14|2024-09-08|2025-02-05,5|5|2|5|5|4|5|3,,,"11 a.m.|10 a.m.|12 p.m.",67.6|66.6|57.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,pain_management_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJeVY0SQwEuYkRrcXipTlgj3U,377

If you go to see him for an appointment, tell him Linda Nice says Hello....|Dr. Henry is one of the best doctors I have ever had. Quality, caring, invested pain management doctors are RARE. Prior to finding Dr. Henry Achampong's practice 8 years ago, I had gone to two other pain management practices, both of which would basically just hand you an opioid prescription and say ""see you in a month"". They never seemed to care, and the only thing they were ever worried about was prescribing more medication. Dr. Henry truly cares about his patients. Just for me personally, he has always gone above and beyond, he is very invested and is always doing research and looking at every alternative option instead of just prescribing pills. I had a spinal cord injury in 2020 and was in a wheelchair and was told I would never walk again. Dr. Henry took the time to do a lot of research and read a lot of clinical studies and actually found things that would help to repair the spinal cord damage and I am happy to tell you that today, three years later I can walk most of the time, only requiring my wheelchair for long distances. I recommend him to everyone that asks for a PM recommendation and I truly just can't say enough good things about him. In the eight years I have been seeing him, I have lived in a couple different places, one of which was over two hours away from his office, but I still always made sure to make the drive because I do not think he is replaceable.|The doctor is very easy to talk too...He listens very well and is understanding.  I like the fact that he has a game plan for your treatments...very nice staff, as well..|I feel like Dr Henry is a good listener and that means a lot to me.

The doctor I seen today was very rude and that's putting it lightly. This was my first visit there, I won't be back. I have severe health problems and the doctor that I saw was completely rude about that, and all the areas that I have pain in. Then he got mad asking me why my primary care doctor didn't do certain tests before he sent me to him. All those things is what my primary doctor said that this doctor would do, and that was the reason why he was referring me to this doctor.  When he asked me about taking Motrin I told him that my GI doctor said I can no longer take anything with Ibuprofen products due to my stomach lining eroding and he acted like he was mad about that. To top matters off, he asked me why I came a day early for my appointment. I explained to him that their office had called me the day before and asked could I come in a day earlier than my appointment was scheduled for. Mind you like I said I'm in the examination room with him while he's complaining about why the staff is scheduling him with all these new patients  knowing how long it takes a doctor to see a new patient like it's my fault. I highly recommend if you want a good doctor that genuinely cares about how you feel then avoid this place at all costs. The staff that works at the front desk where you first check in at were the sweetest, kindest ladies. They were the only good thing about this place.|I truly trust & respect Dr. Robert Tsuji, MD
He has made my life better and more manageable. He explains my health issues in great detail. I'm very thankful.
The staff is great & very helpful.|I went to see Dr. Tsuji for another opinion on how to manage chronic thoracic and cervical pain that I have been dealing with for 8-9 years. I also wanted to get some injections. He seemed to smerk at me the entire time, even while I began crying. This pain has obviously taken a toll on my life and he made me feel like I was complaining and overreacting. He told me that ""there is not a magic cure"" and ""it could be worse, at least you don't have cancer or multiple sclerosis.""  He also made sure to let me know that he blew out two of his vertebrae and is fine now. I'm not sure if that was a hint at me not doing enough or what. He ended the visit by walking out of the room without explaining the next steps. I then walked out to the lobby and nobody was there to check me out or set up another appointment.

I tried to cancel an appointment for my mother because she was in the hospital. I was told I can't cancel the appointment because of HIPAA. I explained to the person I was speaking with that HIPAA does not regulate appointments, canceling or making appointments for another person. They didn't want to listen to me and didn't cancel my mom's appointment which she did not make because she was in the hospital and then they sent me a bill for a no-show fee. This company needs to train their people better on what HIPAA is and stop making it so difficult for patience in their families to schedule appointments or cancel appointments. My mother passed away the following week so thank God I will never have to deal With this office again.|Had a consultation appointment on 7/30 for injections for my migraines. Scheduled an appointment for 8/20 to give them time to get the medication in. It's 8/22 and they have not sent the prescription to my pharmacy yet despite my repeated calls. The practice manager was supposed to call me 8/19 and every time I call the tell me she will call me back but has not. I'm now overdue for this and out $50 for a consultation and now have to start the process all over with another doctor since they won't follow up.

In response my original review on 8/22 I called 4 times that day requesting a call back and nothing until I left a review. Office manager pretended to have no idea there was an issue and completely ignored me telling them they needed to use my pharmacy and not do buy and bill. I tried calling until I spoke to the office manager at 3pm on 8/26 who basically told me they weren't going to tell me what they were going to charge for the Botox and that was between me and my insurance. I again explained that my insurance told me they weren't covering it and asked what they were going to charge. She told me would call billing back and get the information. Apparently she left the office less than 30 minutes as she had planned to do which is fine. She however did not tell me and knew my appointment was first thing the next morning and that she wasn't actually going to call me back despite literally telling me she would.

As an updated despite going in person to speak with the office manager on 8/27 it's 8/31 and this prescription was not sent as has been promised more than once now.|Ms. Darnette and Ms. Myisha, the ladies at the front desk are amazing! I'm always welcomed with a warm smile and hello. They ask me how I'm doing and are always very polite and helpful. These two ladies do not receive enough credit for the hard work that they do, and the difficult patients they deal with. I've witnessed both ladies deal with some very rude patients, and they still remain polite.
I had to stop by the office last week to pick something up, it was about 4:30pm. Everyone in the office had already left for the day or was leaving. While there, a man came in, about 4:40pm. Both ladies said hello to him, and he kept looking at his phone. It seemed like he was looking for something on his phone, but he didn't speak. Finally, he spoke up, but was not providing much information. He was saying he received a voicemail msg about an opening for a procedure. I couldn't understand why he had to come into the office to tell the ladies that information. The appointment he was asking about was for December 3rd, I couldn't understand why he was in the office asking about an appointment so far out. Ms. Darnette had to keep trying to get information out of this man because he was not giving much information for anyone to understand why he was in the office. It took several minutes and several questions for her to get the man to tell her why he was even there. I was frustrated witnessing what was going on, but both ladies still remained very polite and professional.
Over the past few years, I've witnessed too many patients being rude to both ladies, and it should not be that way. I've never seen the office manager step in to try to help resolve an issue. Ms. Darnette and Ms. Myisha both handle every situation in a professional manner, even when patients are being rude and disrespectful towards them.|While the providers I've seen have been okay and educational, this place overbooks every day and I have had numerous days wait times of over 2 hours to be seen. I would advise caution when making an appointment. It would appear they do not value your time, only your or your insurance companies' money.|Been seeing Dr Yoon for a few years now. He's so great!

I feel so lucky to have such an amazing practitioner treating my neck and back pain.  Her trigger point injections are life changing for the pain, and over all office experience has been excellent!  I see her both in Glen Burnie and Annapolis.|Office is great the ladies up front are sweethearts.i been on pain management for yrs and had side effects with the shots so I just stayed on medication. I was on 7.5 oxycodone which helped.i was prescribed every 6 hrs. This pain management kept my same milligram and lowered me to every 8 hrs and didn't even give me 30 day supply. Now I have Two more bad disc in my neck and now have two in my back.and the Dr said I don't want to keep treating you with opioid I want to do injections I told him they didn't help me and gave me side effects he told me the side effects wasnt caused from the injections.i told him I'm in alot of pain and that I need a higher milligram because these new disc problems and nerve damage are more painful.i function and work well when I have my medicine.he gave me the prescription for the shots and told me to take them to the front desk for scheduling.i threw them away I'm not taking a chance of having more side effects again.so I guess I will probably have to find another pain management who is going to let me be pain free and give me my medicine that's helping Instead wanting to stick me with a bunch of needles that didn't help me.and I would have to hunt the Dr down every month to call my medicine in and then it would take him 7 to 10 days more to call it in. Now my new Dr has me on the same prescription schedule  as Dr fad. And now I'm in more pain than I was before.why cant I find a Dr who is going to give me the correct prescription so I can be out of pain.and I never had a failed urine and always taken my medicine as prescribed and never ran out|This place is definitely busy but the office staff in front are amazing. So have patience with the line.  It definitely moves fast if you do the check in on the phone. Now for the physician I saw who was Timothy Yoon he was outstanding!!

Unfortunately, yesterday I had an appointment that was cancelled due to a doctor being sick. These things happen, however I did not receive any communication regarding this. I showed up for my appointment early to check in at the front desk and was scoffed at as to why I was even there. The lady I checked in with was trying to help me to understand what happened, while the other lady at the front desk sat there and was just sitting there running her mouth about how she called everyone, left messages etc. I received no phone call whatsoever or would never have shown up for an appointment and would have rescheduled it. This lady was completely dismissive that I could have not received a phone call. The lady who was checking me in then asked if I could wait for a possible appointment today or would like to reschedule. The other lady, at the front desk goes why are you trying to help him, we are already backed up as it is. For someone who had already had their last appointment cancelled and now this one was a giant gut punch when it is already hard enough trying to get help for chronic pain, to hear this is demoralizing. When you are dealing with pain and are in need of assistance, you should not be met with constant resistance of how not to be able to treat a patient. I am very hesitant to return to this office as MY experience has been very unprofessional.|Today was my first time being at the practice.

The doctor came in right after he was very knowledgeable and he had a great conversation and came up with a plan. I look forward to continuing my journey with this practice.|Clearway Pain Solutions provides excellent care in a timely manner. The office is professional, friendly with great customer service.  Dr. Foo provided me with clarity and options to best meet my needs while demonstrating a comfortable doctor, patient relationship . I would recommend this office to all inquirers.|First appointment. A real pleasure from start to finish! Phone was answered quickly, my info collected and just by luck I was able to get an appointment same day.

Front desk staff helpful and friendly, Christina the nurse took me back on time and took additional info, she had already gathered previous mri's and info. I didnt expect them to have all my records on such short notice.

Met with Dr. Fadayomi, he spent the time to listen and didnt rush me. Got a plan together and scheduled a procedure.

Very satisfied, look forward to working with this office and Dr. Fadayomi.|I arrived at 12:35 pm for a 1 pm appointment today with Dr. Oluseyi Fadayomi and was not seen until 2:45. Dr. Fadayomi did not have the documentation that I provided to the front desk with him (such as the list of medications that I am taking), he was rude and argumentative and went so far as to say that I was late for the appointment and that he did not like my attitude! I have never been treated so badly by a medical professional in my life. I have filed a complaint with the insurance company and let my orthopedic doctor know that he should not recommend Clearway Pain Solutions to his patients.

I have also filed a complaint with the Maryland Board of Physicians.

Ray Boedecker|Office staff is amazing. No matter whether someone is checking in or out and there's complete chaos, they are calm and always find a way to laugh.

Dr. Foo is great at what he does. He's thorough and listens to what his patients are saying. He doesn't believe in just going from an  office visit directly to surgery to resolve problems. He works through a series of steps to determine best course of treatment. He also believes in Physical Therapy to fix mechanics of the body.|Dr Patel did not take Good Care Of My Health.... I had a Medication Reaction And He Did Not Care He Let Me Go 3Days Without Any Medication And When I Saw Him On Monday Morning I Came Into The Office For Nothing...He Knew The New RX MY RX Was Going To Be Out Of Stock And He Didn't Care Nor Did He Return My Email Of Phone Calls!|I met with Dr. Foo. He did not rush through the exam and he asked very specific questions. He tentatively diagnosed my problem which was definitively confirmed by a rheumatologist. After being in pain for two years, I am extremely grateful to him. I do want to add that the staff is wonderful from check in to check out.

All his staff are also kind and welcoming, this makes all the difference when you are navigating a chronic illness.|I have never been to a pain management clinic before coming here but I can only imagine this is the epitome of how pain management should be done.

I came here on referral after a spinal cord injury and surgery to fix it. They understand that there is no need to live in pain.

They focussed first on finding the causes of the pain and reffering me to options I never knew existed like in home occupational therapy and tests like EMGs to understand what my pain was, not just throw medicine at it.

Of course they give medicine but low and slow doses is the way its done and thats how it should be done. Both providers operate this way and are very compassionate. The whole office is great, kind and understanding.

I have never experienced such a professional clinic staff. They are very easy to contact if you ever have an issue and will go to great lengths to solve any issue even if it isn't their fault, like a pharmacy being out of stock.

I could keep going on and on about how great this office is of course but I want to emphasize that they truely care and if you are truely in pain they will give you all the tools you need to live a normal life again.

I have no idea why others complain in some of the reviews here... because I have only ecountered kind and professional people at this office... both providers and the staff.

A lot of people have ruined pain management in this country by abusing it. Doctors offices like these are put under the microscope by regulations because of the epidemic of painkiller abuse in this country. However, if you are in pain and you listen to the medical advise and at least give a good effort then Comprehensive Pain Center may be the best thing that has ever happened to get your life back.

I came in on a cane hardly able to do anything... and a few months later I was building legos and playing with my son and felt alive again. My journey isn't over with my medical issues but I now have all the tools I need to live a fulfiling life thanks to this great great team and office.|For over 2 years my nerves have been compressed in my neck and back causing extreme pain in my head, neck, and shoulders all the way down through my arms to my fingers.

He wanted me to do some tests which my other Drs should have ordered but never did. Today I found out I have another rare illness bc of those tests.

This place is very unprofessional, the owner himself need to loss his license and I will be reporting this guy to the medical board of medicine with my supporting documents. How could you tell someone that they drink to much water? How could you just play with someone pain and terminate their medical plan without giving them their last prescription until they find a new doctor? So if anything happens to my body since I was discharged I will be filing a lawsuit. If you are doing everything this Janak guy is telling you he does not care he still will unprovoked and with no explanation may I add when I asked what was the problem I was told that and I quote ""THIS IS NOT A BIOLOGY LESSON"". Which as you could imagine left me even more confused. I asked for my last few labs which came back almost identical. I add that because my last visit I was told by Dr. Daniel that my urinalysis was great. Also they send in urine samples multiple times a month when you are past your 90 days which I was told by the lady that work there that they are not suppose to do that. I will be asking for a printout of the treatment that I received so I can inform my insurance company of anything that I did not have done. Dr. Daniel Also gave me injection shots in my shoulder and in my neck and when I expressed to him on my next visit that the shots was not working anymore, like I felt the relief the first week but the second week I didn't feel a relief anymore, so I let him know my next visit that I didn't don't feel the effects of the injection. He must have forgot that he gave me the injections before he then say I wouldn't recommend you getting injections in your shoulder because the injections in your shoulder is not gonna be effective so why did you inject me in my shoulder if you know that this is not gonna be effective that's just some of the things that they do. I should've seeked a malpractice attorney right then and there. Who really want the hassle of having to find another facility. All in all I wish I could give Janak business a negative -5 stars very horrible and I forgot to add this guy pulled the I'm the boss there's no one higher then me card on me a (patient). You could have something in your urine with a 0.0? And Janak will penalize you for it. That's all if you guy experienced anything like this comment below and we I could point you in the right direction. This is my experience.|Waiting room is cold, the door barely shuts and the receptionist up front is just rude and lazy. The chairs in the back are horrible. When you go to sit down in them you fall into the chair like it's about to rip open. You can hear everything in the waiting area such as the doctor speaking with other patients. Checking out is horrible I left and was called back telling me they forgot to have me to fill out releases forms so I had to come back in. A trying to request a certain day out of the week due to my busy work schedule the receptionist sounded annoyed. She was going to let me leave again if I didn't mention anything about needed my referral for something else. After I mentioned it she handed me the paper but if I didn't say anything she would've let me leave again without everything. The doctor himself seems caring and nice but the staff up front is not friendly. I wasted almost two hours in there waiting for a 10 minute consult with a doctor.|I visited the office at national Baltimore Pike. They were friendly and very professional and The pain management Doctor was very experienced in his work/ was concerned about my feelings/pain. But the people who are answering the phone at the odenton offices not professional at all I kept calling for an appointment and they was giving me appointments for 2 months from the date that I called which I was already a patient and was in pain they didn't ask me that and was not concerned about what kind of pain I was in I asked to speak to a supervisor and they would never put her on the phone kept telling me she was in meetings she couldn't talk to me all in all the fact that I went to was very professional and handled me with care I want to thank that team at Baltimore national Pike|This place is a disaster. I came for severe lower back pain after weeks of suffering. It's been a month and I'm still in pain. The clerical staff is all about forcing me to come to the office unnecessarily to charge the insurance company and demand a $30 copayment. The doctor that runs the place is never there for a consultation and I'm seen by his young quack physician assistant (PA) flunkie who doesn't know squat. First injection to the back was a complete failure. Can't go back for another injection for a month.Save yourself the aggravation and undue suffering and find another doctor who has a real office(not a former storefront where everything can be heard in the waiting area( with real doctors and staff that isn't obsessively concerned with paperwork and copayments. This place is all about themselves not the patient.Avoid the nightmare.

Don't say you weren't warned!!|Daniel is veey caring and listens to what is going on with your body. He specializes with muscular and skeletor.  He tries to address the issues and  makes your pain more managable.|Dr. Daniel E. Talked over me, pushing me to have an injection I didn't want, and just about refused to consider keeping me on my meds.    He also dumped most of my husband's meds down the toilet, saying he would write a prescription for one medication and sent in a prescription for something else.|Very nice and spacious office, with friendly staff a physician that actually listens.|First vist was awesome!

Not only was I seen on short notice, but he also took the time to explain things to me in a way that was easy to understand. Because pain differs based on root cause and the person experiencing it, I wouldn't expect to have perfect outcomes every time.

Dr. Telles and his staff are welcoming, kind and knowledgeable. The team took their time to listening to my concerns, explain my options in details and answered all my questions.

I have been seeing Dr. Torres for many years, and he has significantly helped me with my back pain.  Dr. Torres is amazing and really cares about his patients. I completely trust his skills and his guidance.  I recently saw Angela and she suggested we try a different procedure, and it was a great decision.  She is very knowledgeable, caring, and listened to me.  The office staff are very helpful as well.  I also love my ""dream team"" of Fred and Dave at the surgery center.  When I see their faces upon arrival, I know I will be in great hands.|Headaches are gone!
Dr. Ginawardane, Trish, Dave, Fred and the entire staff were friendly, caring and professional.  I had a cervical facet block (R/L sides) on neck and it completely alleviated the pain I've had for 2 years.

It's ALWAYS a pleasant experience. The receptionist has been at this office long but I love her. She's so helpful and patient. I'm VERY pleased with the service from start to finish! I highly recommend this office. Dr Gunawardane is also great at what he does. Every procedure has helped me receive as much relief as it could. I'm extremely pleased.|Dr. Torres has always been very polite, understanding and sympathetic. I put my trust in his ability to make my injuries manageable on a daily basis. Thank you Dr. Torres for being a great doctor!|I love the doctors at this practice. They are very honest. And care deeply for their patients. I have seen both nurse practitioners. For people who sit and listen to peoples problems, they are very cheerful. They are very intelligent and focused on getting me the best treatment. Also very Thorough on exams and order the proper tests. I like that they put my safety first. Dr Torres doesn't just throw pills at me. There is many interventions you can try.

Dr Oppong is well respected and professional and knowledgeable and really takes the time to listen and explain the process of making you feel comfortable and confident in your own abilities and working with you to make sure you have everything you need to succeed. And his office manager Brittany have proven time and time again that they are very good and making sure you understand that you matter|Heeeyyyyyyy Y'all. Okay now, you might want to take a seat for this one. It may get a bit lengthy, but Trust and Believe, it's all worth it! I've been a patient with IPS for many many years. When I first visited this office, I was quite uncertain if I was going to stay. Only because having to become acclimated to new Drs, staff..etc can be a bit Overwhelming at times. Needless to say, through the years, other than having to pry myself out of my warm and cozy bed, I NOW look forward to going into the office. Dr. Oppong...well let me just say, he grew on me. He was always pleasant and patient. It was just me that had to get adjusted. He listens to what you have to say and exhibits genuine concern. Okay on to the good part. :-)
The real reason for this post is to Brag on my Girl Brittany-Office Manager. She is PHENOMENAL, to say the least. If she isn't in the office, please just let me reschedule and stay at home. Brittany is the Absolute Best young lady that Dr. Oppong has EVER had on his team!! If you haven't had the opportunity to be cared for by her, you have truly Missed out!! Brittany is so caring, pleasant, loving, warm and kind-hearted, respectful, understanding, cheerful. compassionate, knowledgeable, personable....she is INNOVATIVE!! In conclusion, if you haven't had the pleasure of meeting and interacting with Brittany, you need to call RIGHT NOW...YES RIGHT NOW and schedule an appointment. She will make you forget about the reason you came to INNOVATIVE PAIN SOLUTIONS, you'll forget about your pain, even if only momentarily.

I shouldn't have to do that. I'm not asking for a consultation, I'm asking if they treated my specific condition, which should be a yes or no answer.

Instead, they want me to spend money just to find out.

I was assigned the most popular physician in the practice, and was hopeful that I might finally get some answers and have moments where I was not in terrible pain. The doctor decided to focus on the degenerative this disease in my neck and the pinched nerves, referring me to physical therapy. my condition was far too advanced for PT to be successful, so I was fired actor three sessions. The physician then decided to do one Cortizone shot in my neck. When that didn't work, I didn't hear from them anymore.

After making phone calls and finally getting the right location I arrived 5 minutes prior to my appointment. Once I finally spoke with someone at the desk approximately 5 min past my appointment time I was told that it would need to be rescheduled due to the nurse practitioner have strict policies about being on time. Had this company updated an app that most people use this would not have been an issue. Do better.|I went in for an EEG. The office staff was super friendly. I received an email prior to my appointments to register so I only had a few papers to sign. The doctor explained the tests I was going to have and let me know exactly what she was doing the entire time time. She discussed the findings with me and referred me back to my neurologist for further care.|I unfortunately am suffering from a disc bulge and was given a referral to this office to begin my healing journey. I've never had to deal with anything like this before and did not understand what pain management was or if it was the right direction to go. So initially they gave me a referral for PT and submitted a request for an MRI.

Insurance denied the MRI, wanting a specific amount of PT before approval. So I returned for what I assumed was a PT appointment, to be told it was actually a follow up for the MRI that was denied. Strike one.

Finally get PT scheduled and an MRI done where the disc bulge was found. Scheduled for a epidural steroid injection where I was made to wait over an hour to be called back for a 20 minute procedure. Strike 1.5?

Had a post procedure follow up where I advised the clinician that I experienced severe and painful diarrhea and wanted to know if there were other options or something that could be done differently to avoid as I was doubled over in pain for 12+ hours.

Clinician became visibly defensive, saying surgery changes your bone structure permanently and that they had never in their years in the medical field had that happen to anyone (making me feel like a liar). Then reversing course and saying it could have been a few things that caused it.

When I again asked for other options, clinician was again defensive, but then seemingly to just get rid of me told me that they would give me a referral to a surgeon despite that not even being what I asked for. Strike two.

I decided to schedule a second injection, but this time without sedation to hopefully mitigate the side effects as that was thought to have been the cause.

Fast forward to today, my appointment is approaching and I have to take either PTO or make up time missed. The surgery center calls to move me up as they had a cancellation. I advise that I cannot make that work in my schedule. Despite this, they ask what the earliest is that I can come in, and I again repeat that I cannot come in any earlier. We end the call and I assume my time is still fine.

An hour later, I get an email that my appointment has been moved up without my consent. Strike three, though I know this isn't the same office.

I'm removing myself from their practice and don't feel comfortable returning. Please treat your patients better. I can understand if you have difficult patients wearing you thin, but I was just asking questions and trying to avoid the discomfort of the side effects that I presented with.|Didn't take me as a patient cause i was discharged from another pain management, wouldn't listen to me, treated me, you know a certain way and had the gall to bill my insurance over $600 and sent me a bill for $ 140 ! Good luck with that ! This is a pure racket !!! They don't care, NO EMPATHY!!!!!!! Calling my insurance to tell them not to pay for basically being judged as a drug addict with stage 4 cancer 2 knee replacements that are worn out and throbbing and neuropathy so bad in my feet I can't even feel him always tingling burning, worst place I've ever been to plus it was cold as heck outside they couldn't even run the heat. I don't know what the hell is wrong with them but what a racket and the office manager she's no better. She came into the room too. I'm not done with them, though. This is just a review!|After calling their 833 number and working through the call director, I finally got connected to new patient services. It was extremely difficult to understand the representative due to their limited English capability. After providing preliminary information, they had to go off the line to apparently consult with someone. He came back on the line and got a little more information and off he went again. He then came back and said that I couldn't get an EMG scheduled unless I got discharged from my current pain management provider. Any consideration I had of switching to them has now gone out the window with such poor representatives. When I questioned he why I had to be discharged from my current provider to have an EMG done, off he went for a couple more minutes. He came back on the line to tell me that he could continue adding me to the system. He asked for address which was provided and he said that he had to put it into the system, and off he went again! After he came back I told him that I had more than one insurance plan and, you guessed it, off he went again, and I'm back to the awful techno music on hold. He apparently comes back again because the techno music stops and the next thing I know is that I have been disconnected.
If this is the way that they train their administrative staff, I want nothing to do with them since they obviously have no quality control or concern about the impression they are giving to potential new patients. There aren't a lot of pain management choices in this area, but anything is going to be far better than dealing with this practice.  Forewarned is forearmed!

12-03-2024 - As a further warning, just look at their response. The issue is about the poor customer service provided through their phone provider, and their response is to call their obviously poor phone service provider again to address the issue!|Dr. Medic is very friendly and takes the time to really listen. She explained the process and procedures very thoroughly and made sure I understood the pros and cons. Her staff is friendly from the check in to checking out. I definitely will recommend|Dr Medic truly cares and wants the best for her patients. She listens carefully to make sure the plan for you fits and helps.|Nate was over booked on the day i waited for him.  There was enough clients in the waiting room to make a Tarzan Movie.
I will follow Nate's suggestion to pick a different arrival time for my next appointment.  Nate was, as always, both informative and very pleasant to work with.

I didn't know what to expect when I made the appointment but I did hope that it would provide some relief for my excruciating back pain. After waiting for about an hour the Dr came in and told me to go get 2 MRI's if my insurance would cover them. He never even palpated my back to see how in spasm it was. My insurance ended up not covering any of the bill so here I am $500 in debt to this place that did nothing but add to my stress! Go elsewhere if you  would like a proper exam.|I've gone here in the past for quite a while. I returned after several years. They now have a new PA and she is miserable. I'm 62 years old and it was the WORST appointment of my entire life. No exaggeration. I asked if they had another PA I could see, but, they do not. I had to repeat several times what I had x-rays of, the doctors I had seen, and what I had MRIs of. She wouldn't provide any options because I didn't have MRIs done yet (understand what I'm saying?). She wanted to treat the one worst pain I was having. With psoriatic arthritis, the pain moves constantly. I finally told her my hip. She asked me 3 different times if I would consider shots. Of course I would. She said she was going to get an x-ray of my hip. I asked about an MRI, too. She said no. An MRI detects soft tissue damage. The bursa is soft tissue. I asked if I should get an x-ray of my neck, also, since I don't have that. She said no. Why would she not take that since an accident caused damage to it over 30 years ago and that may be what the main pain is on the next visit? She wouldn't provide opiods because she needed MRIs first...hmmmm. If she was worried about me being an opiod dependent person, why did I stop going (on my own) several years ago? It was a disastrous appointment. It wasn't a waste because I discovered that I needed to find another pain management clinic. WARNING! Since I had seen another clinic, now I have to get a letter of discharge from this clinic because they think you're doctor shopping. Well, I am, because their nursing assistant is a potential tragedy to your health and pain relief.|I have been a patient at this wonderful Facility for well over 10 years.  They are simply fantastic!  I'm so very grateful for their impeccable workmanship & knowledge, very friendly & caring staff. Most of all, the Nurse Practitioner I have had the honor of being treated by, is dedicated to superlative superior performance & treatment.  Thank you so very much MD Pain & Spine!  You keep my body going with the pain management plan you have in place for me.  I honestly don't know what I would do without you!|Dr G is amazing, I experienced relief immediately. My pain went from 8 to 3 or 4 during the procedure.
I haven't slept in 3 days the pain has gotten so bad, the rain all weekend didn't help. Dr G has done 7 procedures over 15 years. He's been a miracle worker for me.
I strongly recommend him to anyone having serious back pain.|Let me start by saying that the front desk staff are really nice and my care from Dr. G. has been excellent. This review is specific to my experience this morning. Historically, I've spent HOURS waiting in the waiting room for appointment times in the past (each time, having to take vacation time off of work). I have never once complained because I've been happy with the care received and Dr. G's thoroughness. He really does care for his patients. This morning, I got stuck in some construction traffic on the way to my appointment and walked into the office 8 minutes after my appointment time and the nurse practioner refused to see me. Again, I took time off of work for this appointment. Considering I was a few minutes late due to circumstances beyond my control, and I typically wait on average for 30 minutes plus (to sometimes hours after my appointment  times) in the past, I was absolutely shocked that I was turned away. Life happens, please re-evaluate your policies and be transparent about them. It seems like patients just have to deal with waiting for hours on end, but when life happens and I was less than 10 minutes late, I would have thought that the practice would have extended me a little grace like I have done numerous times for them in the past, without so much as a
complaint.|Kudos to those who find this Dr. G helpful! I did not! Waiting for two long hours to be seeing and no apologies. Violation my patient's rights by bringing an intern with him into the session without asking for my consent, and treating me like I'm a charity patient is not what I consider quality customer service! I'm both a patient and a customer. He and his staff charge a lot money to my medical insurance and I pay for it. The least I expect is respect and good medical care. Dr. G did not provide either to me.|I had a very positive experience with Md pain. They were both friendly, professional and thorough.  Positive first visit!

Oct. 5, 2022. I'm still a patient with MD pain and spine, very happily so. The front office is always pleasant and quick to help or answer questions. My doctor is over the top thorough, compassionate and attentive. Honestly. I've not had an issue since I started there. Very satisfied with my experience so far.

April 17, 2023.  Still loving to go to my appointments at MD  Pain and Spine. All the office people r still helpful and pleasant whenever I go in, and my doctor is still the very best. Recently tho, I had the occasion to have a different doctor for my regular appointment while mine was on vacation. As it turns out, she was also  kind and knowledgeable during my visit. I was happy to experience the same type of professional behavior from another doctor at the practice as what I've seen so far with the other members of this office. Thanks everyone at MD Pain and Spine for always making my appointments comfortable and pleasant!! Keep up the great work!

This is now July, 2023. Guess what!  I'm still just as happy as ever with MD Pain and Spine. I have very good experiences with everyone there, no matter whether it's by phone or in person. I know I always say the same thing, but it's entirely true. Believe me, I'm the first to complain when I feel something isn't right or if I or my family has not been treated well. This office has never been anything but first class and professional with me. I appreciate that so very much.

February 21, 2024.  What can I say? Still always my favorite office to visit. I appreciate their professionalism for the reason I'm there; but, also the whole offices' social friendliness as well. Thanks for both. See u next month!

August 19, 2024.    I'm still content using MD Pain and Spine. The doctors, as well as the office personnel, are always helpful and professional, while being as friendly as a long-known neighbor. I remain very happy with this medical practice, and would be comfortable recommending them to anyone.|Wonderful place!!!

After explaining how & why my pain was significantly lessened. I was told I didn't need a shot. That PT would be my best course of action.
Understanding that was money Clearway isn't getting from my insurance & knowing the physician could have told me it was still in my best interest to get the shot (and I would have); I greatly appreciated the honesty & integrity of the physician.

Thank you, Jeanette for your honesty & integrity! I would definitely recommend Clearway Pain Solutions in Waldorf MD!|Communication starts with the initial call,  I say this because I was very clear that we were looking for a doctor that deals with Fibromyalgia and chronic pain.  I was told AND it is in the description on our Insurance website, that they do.  My daughter suffers with the above stated chronic conditions and has aged out of the pain clinic at Children's Hospital.  We were searching for new doctors and made an appointment, only to be told by Dr.A that he works with spinal issues.  Not sure where the breakdown in communication happened, but it was a waste of time for all involved.

The front desk staff was very nice and Dr.A was also kind.|My visits are always good. Dr Shah has always been easy to talk with. And we go over a plan each time.
If something isn't how it should be I talk to her about it. But I've never had any problems.

The front desk staff and medical technicians are very welcoming. Dr. Shah is a person who gets to know her patients by listening, asking what questions or concerns that you might have as well as working with you to provide the best health care for you. Thank you so much!|I was disappointed about the wait time, there was one patient in the lobby with me. I arrived 5 minutes late but had to wait 45 minutes before they took my BP, then I had to wait another 20 mins before the doctor came . Then she spent 3 minutes wrote a prescription and said comeback in 30 days. Unacceptable could done webinar or online virtual appointment.|I have been a patient of Clearway Pain Management, for a number of years. The staff, are friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. They have offices in all 3 counties.

What I don't like about them. You can't call the office, to speak with the staff, or ask questions. Everything is fed through a call center. You don't speak to the same person, so if something isn't handled correctly, you either have to sit with your fingers crossed, it gets done, or go down to the closest office, and ask for assistance. That's not the best solution either. I would prefer that when I speak with someone, that somewhere there's accountability, when you are continuing to wait, while someone, somewhere, that has no vested interest in you, is telling you, they will take care if it. I am now 7 days later, still waiting for  a prescription, that didn't go through the electronic system, to the pharmacist.

So, if your okay, with that kind of attention, then by all means, this is the doctor's office for you!|Generally the service is as expected. Most of the staff are friendly. Lately, there have been numerous instances where nobody shows up to open the office and check folks in. Also, (and it might be related to the time it takes for people to check in), but one Dr or PA sometimes arrives to the office 45 mins or longer after the office opens. One day I was seen an hour and a half after I got into the room. I usually always have an 810am appt time.
Part 2 of this review: the surgical side is S L O W!!! Appointments don't matter unless its first thing in the morning. I live an hour away. Last time I came in for my appointment I was told they were at least 2 hours behind - so I was rescheduled. Came in for that visit - again, at least 2 hours behind. My driver has now taken 2 afternoons of time off from work. The office may not care, but we can use every dollar we can make. Again, I'm seeing a trend that is going to force me to find a different provider. The bottom line is Respect. I respect the doctor's and staff's time, i respect being on time so as not to inconvenience other patients. These doctors and techs do not respect our time. I cannot abide by that.|Outstanding, caring of your needs, communicates timely with documentation needed for workers comp. Can't sat enough great things!

Always attentive to my needs and excellent bedside manner. Amy Larson and Dr. Medic have always been great listeners as well as paying attention to what they prescribe and making sure that my needs come first.  Have been a patient since 2013 and regardless if they are booked up, the staff will always find a way to fit me in.  Thanks so much to each and everyone of you that I have had the pleasure of talking to.  On another note, they also will make sure that any of my medications do not interact with another that are prescribed from other doctors.  Great team, from the front desk, medical assistant and doctors.  I would recommend anyone to Clearway.|I always seem to get disrespected.  My husband has been coming here longer so I suppose he gets the better treatment. I was 10 minutes late and my appointment was rescheduled.  He was over 20 minutes late and they took him.  They always seem to have an attitude with me and rarely speaks but I don't know them as well and one of the nurses seem to be the flirty type.  It could just be her mannerisms she has dark hair short cut and she wears glasses.  I could be crazy but that's how it seems. When I walk in they only speak to him and ask him how he's feeling.  It makes me feel uncomfortable. I like people that are genuine especially caregivers and doctors they seem so fake however I did just switch to another Dr he seems to be much better at explaining himself and showing more interest in what's going on with your health.|Can't say enough wonderful things about our visit with Nathan Turner at Clearway Pain in Prince Frederick, MD. He always listens, and spends all the time needed to help solve our difficult problems. He's a caring, knowledgeable, compassionate person who somehow makes us feel that there is a light at the end of our long tunnel. He goes above and beyond looking for medical solutions in caring for us. The staff is excellent. Always helpful, and very friendly. We recommend them highly.|I'd like to give Dr. Medic (yes that's her real name!) five stars. She is great, she listens, she keeps me informed. But the office staff is rude, defensive, and not at all helpful. They never followed up with me when my treatment arrived (or didn't arrive) I was just sitting out here for months in pain not knowing if or when I was going to be treated. Then I got new insurance, so I needed a new appointment to start the approval process over again. The front desk told me they couldn't take my card because the system was down. I asked if she could make a photo copy of it to enter the info when the system came back up and she said no, it has to go into the special scanner. I asked if I could enter it myself through the patient portal and she told me I could. I tried, but there was no way to update it in the portal. I emailed the office and the same girl called me and got defensive, picking apart the words I used in my message and telling me the only way they can take my card is if I bring it back to the office. Obviously not what she told me while I was there, and certainly nothing I've ever heard of with any other practice I have ever used. Most allow me to enter the info manually, or take a picture of the front and back of my card. But the office attendant held firm that I would have to come back to the office and present my insurance card before they can start the process of getting my treatment approved. Anyone who deals with chronic pain knows how hard it is to leave the house at all, let alone drive 30 minutes away because the office has no workaround for when the system fails.

In conclusion, Dr Medic is great, but be prepared for some attitude and inconvenience from the rest of the office.|The whole staff  is absolutely wonderful. Nathan is great at his profession. He is understanding and knowledgeable in condition that causes me terrible pain. All of the ladies that work there are so very kind and friendly.|Zero stars. I was asked to show up 40 minutes early for my appointment. I did. I respect peoples time and understand paperwork can take a minute and being early helps them keep to their schedule. But, waiting over 45 minutes past my appointment time and being told the Dr. will still be a while is unacceptable so I left.  Can we stop normalizing 1 hour wait times for Dr's appointments, it's obscene. I would appreciate my time being valued as much as we are expected to value theirs. The waiting room was interesting as I watched a gentleman berate the receptionist for no reason, cheers to her for handling it like a rockstar!|My apprehension with a first visit was unfounded.  This is one of the first times that the previsit registration  info was used and i didn't have to redo paperwork.   The staff from check-in to triage and treatment were thorough, had an efficient process and were completely professional.

However, since then, the practice has made sure to provide the best care and service possible. Including check in prior to an appt to make sure I wanted to see the same provider. Dr. Hameed has been a lifesaver. The medial branch block she administered to my herniated disc has become non existent. I only trust her hand moving forward with any procedures. Definitely recommended. The earlier appointment the better if possible.|Excellent caring doctor who listens carefully. She answers all my questions and really cares that my pain is well managed. I have cancer in my bones which is difficult to get under control.  She has no problem mixing pain medication to find something that works for me.|Dr Hameed is great. Got 2 injections in knees and she explained every detail to me. Highly recommend.|Dr. Hameed is wonderful. She listens and is very responsive to my concerns and my pain.! She is constantly upgrading my care as she becomes more familiar with my issues.|This review will be broken down in two parts. 1. I see Dr. Alex Bury. He is by far amazing, compassionate, understanding and truly cares for your well being. Getting an appointment is easy, I see him in the Laurel office. The wait is never long.

Now,  if I could rate just the doctor he would receive 5 stars without a question. Now for the one star rating and how I arrived here. I see Dr. Bury for pain medication and other medication to help with my neck pain. Then, I have to schedule my neck injections every 6 months.

You can't call the office you visit because it's a 800 number with the promise of a callback. You can't send a portal message to get answers. Twice now I have had a procedure cancelled on me without notice. Both times, it's because someone didn't submit the info to the insurance for the pre-approval. I carry two insurance plans, one that will approve the same day the secondary authorization will be automatically approved based on the primary.

Twice now, someone dropped the ball and didn't submit the pre-auth. I called my insurance Wednesday, Thursday and Friday with them saying nobody filed anything. My case worker can get any pre-authorization approved within minutes.

Now, I have been in pain for one month. Now, the next appointment for a ten minute procedure is a month away! I have to wait one month! That's two months of pain! Unreal.

I really didn't want to leave Dr. Bury, but having to be in pain for two months is not good for the quality of my life. They refuse to have more procedure days.

Update: 1. I was promised a return call on Monday within the hour. No call has occurred and now it's Wednesday! 2. The response below said this was resolved. My doctor confirmed on Tuesday the office can't figure out my primary and secondary insurance which is crazy given it's the same insurance I use for every visit and procedure. 3. I sent the email listed below with an auto reply stated that I would get a response within 48 hours after sending it. We are beyond that timeline.

To make it worse, I have no date for any procedure. My insurance has stated nothing is pending for approval.

This is ridiculous. All over a 10 minute procedure that I should have been accommodated for.

Sept 30th Update: Spoke to my insurance company today over at the Pre-Auth Dept. Found out today that Aetna DOES NOT REQUIRE A PRE-AUTH for this procedure which makes this really bad. My procedure that was canceled didn't require any authorization! Nobody has called me despite the feedback here. No return email. Radio silence. The procedure appointment they said they would schedule didn't happen.

So my advice to new patients. If you don't require procedures or injections you'll be fine going here. Dr. Alex Bury is the best! But, if you require more than the normal stay away.|Dr Hameed is the absolute best!!!
I travel from Connecticut to Maryland just to have her treat me!   She performed the MILD procedure on my back. To relieve my pain from spinal stenosis and bulging disc which was pushing on my sciatic nerve. It's been 2 months and I have my life back!!!!  I am so grateful and thankful that she was able to perform this non invasive procedure!!!
Thank you so much Dr Hameed!!!|Update:
Dr. Hameed is really good and caring but I had to wait for her more than 50 mins, that made me very sad: if the patient is late 10 mins usually you miss the appointment but when it comes to the doctor you have to wait.. I have nothing to say about her kindness and professionalism but that waiting time...
Physiotherapist Jonathan is number 1, thank you for all you have done!

They have an issue with the finance department or whoever is on charge for billing. In my case, they keep calling for a bill that I already have paid ( you have to pay during checking in anyway), I have the transaction and waste my time to give information to the call center, they won't fix anything. They  can't transfer the call to Columbia location, and today I went to fix this issue after my work, they were closed even though I was there at 4:50(they close at 5)
I'm very disappointed with this problem caused by them, wasting my time on phone and all same!

This was my first review :
I had my first appointment with Dr. Mariam Hameed and she was very professional, kind with very deep understanding of the situation. Staff was also very kind. More updated info after I finish all of my appointments.|I absolutely  my doctor. Dr Patel listens to me,   takes action on my NEEDS immediately,  explains everything were you can understand what's going on with the body,  what possibilities that can happen with future outcomes, referrals to other wonderful doctors that can help with current diagnosis, and he is very easy to talk to. I wish I met him 1st when I started with Clearway Solution. My previous pain management doctor in the same company delayed treatment for me, he was arrogant,  ordered the wrong injection for me didn't discuss any changes of injection and seem to only be interested in making money off a surgery.

I've been there before, maybe a couple years ago and I called last month, I believe this is right and made an appt with a girl named Jessica i think. They went and told me that I was a new patient. So what I had to do like people work online, but it doesn't give you a lot of time to fill it out before it cuts you off and send you back to the front page. So the first appointment that I had to cancel, then i rescheduled for January  7th, 2025. The day of the appt. my truck wouldn't  start so of course i had to cancel. I'm having surgery one march, the third for a problem with my left leg and had to get my injections before the first of february and the peep, the girl at the office lisa would not help me at all. I've tried for over two weeks to get an appointment and couldn't, and there's more doctors than just Dr  Panillio  there. No way was she helping. Very disappointed. So I have to walk around with a boot and also have pain in my lower right back. Never again, will I go to this office. Now I think I know why this girl Jessica left|I used Maryland Pain Specialist and the doctor was fine, the problem was billing for my copays which for some reason the office cannot take credit cards at the office, which I do believe I paid the co-pay at least once but now have to go through my cards to prove that I did. What is so frustrating during then entire time I was seeing the doctor at no time did anyone say that I was behind on my co-pays. I would have paid immediately. So on July 24th they said they tried to reach me and left a message which was impossible because you can't leave a messages on my phone. I was then sent to collections which is costing me another 63.00 dollars. I have spoken to the office recently for records and they were able to reach me easily, why couldn't billing reach me? When I made an inquiry to the billing department they very rude to deal with, this has left me very frustrated. I am very reachable and find that if the office had taken any effort to reach me we could have settled this easily, while I was seeing the doctor. Thry just needed to make me aware that I was behind on my co-pays, then ask, can we assist you in getting this taken care of. I tried to pay the copay each time I had a visit. Just terrible customer service. It's unfortunate because except for the billing department the rest of the was staff has been very helpful|Dr. O. at Maryland Pain Specialist is a wonderful, respectful, professional, knowledgeable pain specialist with impeccable bedside manners. I started with this practice group about a year ago and have nothing but high praise for them. The office staff at both the Bellona and The O'Dea office are very friendly and professional.  Dr. O's assistant, Michelle, always returns my calls immediately and has been nothing short of helpful.  Also not to forget the wonderful receptionists, front office staff and wonderful nurses at the Ruxton Surgery Center where I have received by back injections.|Called on November 2nd and 3rd. Finally got ahold of someone on the 3rd. Was told that since I am a new patient they need to gather some information before scheduling an appointment for me. I also had to send over insurance information and did right away on the 3rd to Lisa. It has been over 3 weeks now and never heard back from them. Not really sure how this place can be considered a pain specialist when you can't even get in to get help with said pain. Should just have said you're not accepting new patients, would have wasted less of my time waiting and trying to find somewhere else for help. Terrible customer service. Would highly recommend seeking help elsewhere if you are new.|This practice is terrible. It takes multiple business days to get a return phone call. My old pain management Dr retired, and I'm unable to get my records. These doctors won't even set an appointment with me, unless they see exactly what conditioner I was being treated for. I asked, wouldn't they want to re diagnose my condition anyways, so why do I need my old records. Again I was told no medical records, no appointment. If these doctors don't feel comfortable diagnosing your condition, you should probably look elsewhere, which I have.|I needed to make a follow up appointment since I'm in severe pain from my injection wearing off. I have new insurance since my last visit and they REFUSE to take my information over the phone therefore they WILL NOT schedule me to be seen until I either email, fax, or mail a copy of my new card. I've worked in the medical field for over 15 years and never have I ever heard of such a thing!!! I will NOT be returning and this review will be posted everywhere I can!!!!|I've had pain management for 26 years (CIDP and 7 level cervical fusion) and Dr. Levin was the first to actually hear my issues and not just talk Rx. My 3rd visit/1st procedure (facet injections C3/4 4/5 6/7) provided incredible relief that NO ONE before even thought of or recommcuended. He made me feel comfortable where my previous experiences have made me uneasy. The office has shown great flexibility in appointments and the staff has been very good to work with. After years of inefficient pain management I finally found a doc that that's managing my pain. I'd recommend him to anyone with serious chronic pain issues.|It was a miraculous moment when Dr. Omosule, [Dr. O] and his team of ""Meagans"" completed my Epidural Spine Injection.

DR Mata left the practice.  I was scheduled to see Janet the NP.  Now I see why she not a doctor.  She is a terrible person.  She uses her conservative views into the medical world.  I sign a contact a year ago. I discharged myself and came back for management.  This terrible Nurse P discharged me for legal substance.  Anyone coming to All Star please don't not see this terrible person who will use her personal believes in the medical field.  She actually needs to be hired.  She needs to look herself in morning because she is a terrible Nurse.  She perfers you to be in pain, she feels like she knows best and she not even a doctor.|Awesome experience all around.  I have been a patient here for a number of years, and the care team's compassion and follow-through has been amazing.  The providers have worked with me to manage various stages of pain, and spine/nerve injury providing lots of options, and creating a care plan to keep me in relative comfort.  The support staff are fantastic at making sure you can get the appointments you need, remind you of them, and work to coordinate consults and procedures. Their staff have also worked with both my insurance, and pharmacy when there were issues obtaining various medications and procedures. I would absolutely recommend (and have recommended) this practice to anyone in need of their specialties.|I was going there for over 4 years. One day, I received a call that I was being discharged because of my urinalysis. I was told something showed up. I said, hold on, wait, let me take it again, something must be wrong. The tech said no and Janet was firm with her decision. I could not believe what I was hearing. I was very satisfied with the medication that I was getting and did not feel a need to take anything else. I often told Janet that I was thankful and satisfied for finally getting on meds that made a difference. I'm over 60 years old, still working and also have grands in my care. I didn't have a reason to seek other drugs to take. Everything was fine. The most disappointing thing is, i thought Janet and I had a better relationship than to just dismiss me, like I was nothing. We talked every visit.  I thought that she would have thought there must be something wrong. I wasn't given a chance to talk to her or to get another test. I'd never had a bad test before in the years that I was there. Something should have told her that something must be wrong. I was with this office before they changed their name to All Star. Like I said, I was satisfied. My prescribed medication was allowing me to handle my daily tasks a lot better. I had no reason to try or take anything else. I thought we had a real doctor patient relationship. Boy was I fooled. Also, I called and asked if she would reconsider and after being placed on hold, the receptionist said all discharges were final. I asked, well, what happens to me ? I never got a call back. Just that quick, I was discarded like old paperwork.|All Star Pain Management gets me back on my feet and helps me stay active, to the best of my ability, with minimal pain. Dr. Zed is very patient and explains every procedure. He also answers any questions or concerns I have. The staff is respectful and responsive. I would recommend this to anyone whose life has been disrupted by chronic pain. It has been a game changer and a blessing to me.|Would not recommend going here. Dr. Zed does not listen to what you have to say or pay attention to your medical history. After explaining I had reaction to steriods after a procedure that kept me in the hospital an additional five days, he still is only interested in pushing steriod shot treatment. These can be very dangerous even deadly to people with certain conditions. After getting a second opinion the doctor recommend not getting steriod  treatments without being admitted to the hospital ICU first.Dr. Zed is willing to do it in his  office. There are also other options that should be considered first and this is the only option Dr. Zed has offered.|I have been going to this location for over 2 years now. 4 injections done by Dr. Zed pre and post surgery. His original nurse practitioner Alina Messick was kind, supportive, and helpful. She would spend 30-45 minutes just talking to me every appointment to see how things were going. Sadly she moved on from this practice. Enter Janet Ascione. Since the first appointment with her she has been very curt and pretty much rude at times. I have been on pain pills for almost 2 years. In those 2 years I have never had any incidents, never missed an appointment, nothing. Since day 1 Janet treated me like and made me feel like I was abusing medication or something, mind you I'm prescribed a very minor 5mg/375mg hydrocodone/tylenol. In the 1.5 years before Janet I took 1 drug test because my insurance requested it, since Janet I believe I've taken 5 in the past 6 months. Today I was discharged because she asked me if I had prescriptions filled by any other physicians and I said no. She said they checked pharmacy records and I had a prescription filled a few weeks ago by another Dr. I said ""oh yeah I had a tooth pulled and the dentist gave me a prescription for something, my wife picked it up from the pharmacy and it's in my medicine cabinet"". It was a 3 day supply of 5mg/300mg hydrocodone/Tylenol, which is pretty standard issue after getting a tooth pulled. She proceeded to tell me that I violated my opioid agreement (that was signed 1.5 years ago) and that I also didn't mention the ""surgery"" when the intake girl asked, ""any new x-rays, surgeries, mri's since your last visit?"". I am treated here for my neck and when asked that question I think in terms of my neck and didn't realize I had to disclose having a tooth pulled. She proceeded to treat me like I was purposefully trying to hide this and began to scold and belittle me for it. I kept stating that I didn't realize it, didn't think about it, and even apologized for it. She continued to throw the fact that I signed an opioid agreement (1.5 years ago) in my face and that it was my job to know this and how this was grounds for discharge. At this point I very calmly told her that she was being very rude in the way she was talking to me, repeatedly telling me how wrong I was. As I was saying this she said ""that's it we're done!"". I asked what she meant and she said ""I'm giving you a 2 week supply of meds and discharging you, and you can go find another Dr."". I asked to speak to Dr.Zed and she yelled ""No, I'm discharging you!"" She then asked me to still take another drug test to which I said I would. She then stormed out of the office and even closed the door in my face as I was right behind her walking out to go to the bathroom. I was so shocked by this whole exchange that I didn't even think to ask at the time why I even needed to bother to take a drug test when I was being discharged from their care.
I know this is a super long review but since I wasn't even afforded the opportunity to speak to MY Doctor, who performed 4 spinal injections on me, I am hoping he see's this and reaches out to me so we can talk. I also hope Janet Ascione see's this and thinks back on how she acted and realizes that it was very inappropriate. That is no way to act when you work in this type of field with people living in constant pain who obviously aren't living the best life at the moment.
Finally I hope prospective patients see this just so they can be informed of how they could possibly be treated. It's sad really. The office staff is very nice and helpful, Dr. Zed is a great Dr, and I absolutely loved Alina Messick. Janet Ascione does not fit in with the rest of the kind staff there, and sadly she is the one most patients will see 90% of the time. I hope she turns her attitude/behavior around before she drags down the rest of the practice|I have had two surgeries on my knee, ACL reconstruction in my 20s, I had seen another pain mgmt company prior to ALL STAR  . Their solution was pain medication only , although I do take a small amount of pain medication now , it is far from the amount that another pain  management office prescribed . ALL STAR/ DR Matta offers many other options to provide you quality of life. At 55 years of age ALL STAR gave that back to me . Also their staff is so kind and helpful as well... Thank you All Star|Yesterday I had my first appt. With Dr. Zed. I was so nervous .My son and I walked in and was greeted by a very nice lady. That was a plus. Then all the lady's turned around and said hi that right there showed me I was going to be taking care of. Then when Dr. Zed . Came in the room he shook my hand and my son and he ask what I was there for he was the first Dr. To listen to me and he knew just what needs to be done after many years of pain in hips he hit the nail on the head the first visit yahoo. I got a winner . I think I will keep him .Lol Dr. Zed does not rush you he let me tell her everything I wanted to about my pain even if it was little . I thank God I found a Doctor that listen to me and now I received shots in my hips and he going to keep up on my pain level .God Bless you Dr. Zed I am looking forward to taking this journey with you . I am glad I found you and Patrick i have two great people ready to make me better . You have a great staff and we felt very welcome in your office .Thank you for your kindness and hearing me out I feel much better today since I got the injections.Looking forward to getting my life back to pain free.

Told I needed spinal injections. Offered a prescription for pain. 2 days later, prescription has never been sent to pharmacy. Office receptionist very snobby. Many bad reviews on Internet. Office apparently does not have a direct phone line. It's a Nation wide company that apparently uses a call center. I have received no calls back about my Rx. After calling several times. Scheduled for spinal injections 5 days, but I am going to cancel due to reasons above. If I experience any problems I probably won't be able to get help from the doctor.|This place will offer NO solutions for you or your loved ones pain problems. My mother is an elderly woman who was born without hip sockets, has had over 20 surgeries on her knees and hips and can only walk with the help of crutches. She relies on pain medication just to be able to get through her days. These doctors here seem to not care in the slightest. I understand these meds are federally regulated but these doctors refuse to work with you. They will not do telehealth, they force her to come in once a month to say the same thing each time and get the same prescription. Every single time I take my mom in there, she risks falling and getting injured. She begs them to give her a prescription that will last longer so we don't have to come in as much and what do the doctors do? They make her take a drug test and act like she's an addict. She's an elderly woman on crutches who can't drive and can barely walk, of course she isn't an addict. This place uses what I believe is a foreign call center to handle any of their calls. You will not be able to contact any doctor unless you are willing to plead with someone who you cannot understand for 30 minutes for them to transfer you to the front desk. But if you somehow get through to the front desk, the girl who works there will be mean and rude because God forbid she has to do anymore work. That brings me to my final complaint. The front desk girl. She is terribly rude, doesn't even look at you when she talks to you, and half the time she is on her phone on a personal phone call while you are trying to be helped and scheduled again. This place is an all round terrible experience and I would stay away if you can. I am now going to be driving my mother to one that is three times the distance away just to avoid the headache of dealing with this terrible place.|First visit to Clearway for my wife, who suffers chronic pain from an SI joint dysfunction as well as fibromyalgia.
We saw Dr. Finklestein and were positively impressed. He discussed her current pain med regimen as established by her previous pain management clinic and stated that it was reasonable and he would continue with it.
Then, he immediately moved to addressing the causes of her pain, rather than merely masking it with meds. This is a pleasant change from previous pain management providers and seems like a much better approach.
Dr F ordered an MRI to allow a better assessment of her SI join and scheduled a follow-up in a couple of weeks.
Dr F's manner was pleasant and professional and the supporting staff was efficient, light hearted and actually fun to work with.
We look forward to working with Clearway on my wife's pain issues and taking her life back from the pain demons that plague her.
Given that this was her first visit and treatment has not yet begun, we cannot give Clearway 5 stars yet, but will submit further reviews as things progress.|My husband and I have been going to Clearwater for about 3 years now and we live everyone there. The facility is always clean, staff friendly and caring. Doctors are wonderful. Highly highly recommend them.|If I could leave 0 stars, I would.
The office does not follow their advertised hours, no one is ever available to pick up the phone, if you leave a voicemail no one calls back, the staff is rude in person, and I don't have enough characters to share the horror that is the call center.
The only positive experience has been with Dr. Jari who has shown compassion and understanding to his patients.|Excellent facility with a friendly and efficient staff.

Not to mention unless you get an early appointment, you're waiting there a good 45 mins to see someone.|Today was my first visit To White Marsh location.  I waited about 20-25 minutes total in reception area and exam room. My doc Doctor Gurman was wonderful.  He was attentive and answered all my questions. I was happy that I received treatment this first visit a cortisone shot for my knee.  I would gladly return if needed.|Today was my first visit to Clearway Pain Solutions and Dr. Gurman was simply fantastic! He listened to me, explained the process for injections at their facility, and he made me feel like I'm in good hands. Also, the promptness of my appt and my questions were answered in minutes! I highly recommend this place!|Dr. Yoon is amazing. He explained everything clearly & gave me options regarding my path forward. He is very friendly & compassionate with a nice sense of humor. He spent a good deal of time with me and never appeared hurried or rushed. I have to say he's a keeper.|I had a procedure on 1/27 normally after a procedure my prescriptions are called in to the pharmacy however it has been 2 day and many, many phones calls later between the 27 and 28 with no result. I have been repeatedly told that a message was sent back to the Dr and when he is done with a procedure he would call them in. I am still waiting and it almost the end of business day 2.
I will not be getting anymore procedures done by Dr Jari as a result of this.
After making many calls to the office and returning there on Wednesday the 29th to be told by receptionist at Dr Jari's that they would ""resend"" which they never sent in the 1st place only to find out he had still not sent them. This is very unprofessional and not in a way you would expect a Dr to respond. I will not return for any procedures and will not recommend him for any. This is unacceptable!|The offices for Clearaway pain are wonderful and other than being very busy at times. The -5 star issue is with their call center. The call center is laughable and the staff at the office joke about how terrible the call center is. They say they call the but they don't. I waited on hold so long I got into the car and drove to the office. The call center again said no one answered and I handed the phone over to the front desk rep and she told them they did not call or message the office. To clearaway pain management you have great staff and wonderful docs the call center makes you look badly. You are WAY better than the ""customer service"" you are paying for from this call center.  Also your pain management I'm sure you have enough that having an Accessable service counter would be nice. I hate having to yell over to your wonderful staff.|I had issues with my right hand with a partial tear in my ucl. After 4 months of not being able to find anybody. Dr Jari was very straight to the point and put me in the right direction for hand therapy and recommended me to hands on therapy. I would recommend Dr Jari|Horrible this place was completely horrible. They left me in the room for an whole hour before I was even seen After I was on time for my appointment and was not  late, then the doctor came in and was completely ignoring everything that I said not once did he ask me. How was my pain? Where was my pain? He just said he could not see Because he only do injections And it does not look like I need one and then if I want someplace to go He could tell me he wrote on little piece of paper and ripped in half he did not even hand it to me. He left it on the bed. said he's in Belair, Maryland Don't tell him I sent you he'll give you anything you need he also said my current pain management center that I go to was his competitor So why would I come into his office? I told him that. Traveling distance is starting to be a little too far for me and I was trying to find a new location This location is horrible White marsh No one even held the door for me when I was trying to get out And I am wheelchair bound. I was struggling with the door for about five minutes.

Dr. Yoon remembered everything about me, my funny family stories, history, my triplets and where I moved to. He truly listens to his patients and has an impeccable memory. His bedside manner is wonderful, warm and inviting. He can diagnose you correctly in one visit. Never ever had a doctor that truly listens to and remembers his patients especially after 10 years. Most importantly, I don't have to explain my medical history all over again with him. If you must see pain management, you will never find anything negative about him. I would recommend Dr. Timothy Yoon to any and everyone.|I have been coming to this practice for years now and have experienced multiple physicians and unfortunately they weren't good experiences. However, Dr Yoon has been amazing and the reason I've stayed. He is very personable, efficient and effective. He listens and has great response time when I've had to email him.

Each time, she was minimally cordial & barely engaging. I experience the same energy with the front desk staff. Getting a prescription was a hassle. It was often forgotten, when calling to follow up you'd be assured that it'd be taken care of for it to be further delayed -- while you suffer.

I understand that we have our individual challenges. When you choose to work in an environment managing patients who suffer from chronic pain, more attentiveness & prioritizing compassion would be sincerely appreciated.|Cecilia is who takes care of me every month, I'm blessed to have her as my doctor. I have a lot of issues and alot of pain and so Cecilia helps me so I won't be so miserable. I'm thankful for her. And I can't forget about Maria, she has helped me alot too.|The visit was very professional, and the technicians and receptionist were quite knowledgeable.  my doctor seemed to be knowledgeable but could not locate mu X-rays which were sent to the office.  i also received a bill for compensation and was informed by mu health insurance that the bill had already been settled.|Cecilia Gramsky really cares for her patients well being. She's always great with her patients and always so Informative. She ask great questions. The whole office is Awesome all the way around. All the doctors and staff are great.|Cecelia is wonderful! She takes time to listen and explain. You can tell she truly cares. I'm so thankful to have had her during such difficult times|If I could rate a ZERO, I would. I called for an app't and was told they would reach out to retrieve my MRI report from the place I had it done. Got to my app't two weeks later only for the NP to ask ME where my MRI reports because she needs to view them before care because they don't have them. I only had the email version images that were sent to me for my own records. They were lucky enough to be able to get the same day report, while NP proceeded to see her other patients IF I decided to wait to see if they would get them. Once she got it,  she tells me the images I paid $300 for was not what she needed to see and therefore she could not proceed with care unless I got more images with her referral, one being the SAME images I already got and the other being an area that I'm not having ISSUES with. She didn't bother to see the issue that can be seen with human eyes! Not only that,  two of my doctors viewed the very same images and referred me to this company for pain management. I reached out to my primary to advise that this was the worst place to refer and to please suggest another while I was still there.  NP told me to come back in two weeks after I got what SHE needed, and maybe I could get treated. I made the app't for good gestures ( unlike the good gesture I didn't receive from the NP) and canceled from the parking lot. NP disposition was cold, and I can't even place her name because she appeared to not want to mention it upon greeting. I would have to look at the auto- text messages, and it's not worth it because, as far as I'm concerned, she represents the whole organization, at least at that location. I will say that through the walls, she sounded way more pleasant to her ""OTHER"" existing patients. Obviously, if someone is coming to a PAIN MANAGEMENT establishment, it's because THEY ARE IN PAIN! At least you could show sympathy instead of making me feel like I'm just whining, 'so suffer for two more weeks and see me after I ignore what your docs sent you here for and make my own assessment without really caring what you say'. NEVER, NEVER have to worry about me supporting this establishment. I've never been to a pain management place and was a little reluctant currently. However, the pain I'm in , I was willing to give it a try. End story: I was referred to another one by my primary and praying for a better experience.

Update: I decided it was best for me to look up the NP on my text because the worst experience for me was her.  Irene Bwete-Mugyenzi, CRNP. Might I suggest you have better bedside manners, specifically with NEW patients, or maybe you just didn't like me just looking at me.|My Dad is a a patient here with Cecelia Gramsky, CRNP. She has always been caring and taken care of my Dad's pain for several years now. He is able to function without severe pain and that means so much to me as his daughter and the rest of our family as well. Everyone in the office is always pleasant and caring each time he has an appointment. They have gone above and beyond for him after several of his surgeries when the surgeon could have cared less about his pain.

I have been being seen my Dr. Baksh for 1 and 1/2 years now. Within this time frame I find Dr. Baksh has taken a real personal interest in my overall healthcare. With the treatments that he has performed for the sciatica pain that I am experiencing Dr. Bashk had decided to go a step further and perform a Radio Frequency Ablation  (RFA) yesterday. This procedure will be a great step forward for my pain relief. I woke up this morning and already felt like a new person. Thank you Dr. Baksh for your deep concern in my health. Offices which are in Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland. All 3 are clean and he has great staff that make you feel right at home.|I love Dr Baksh and his staff. Everyone is so friendly.  Dr Baksh has helped me so much to fight my pain caused by psoriatic arthritis. His nurse Shannon makes me laugh every time I'm there. This is why I drive 1 hour and 10 minutes to come here|The service and care you will receive from this office is wonderful. The facility itself is brand new and very clean. Both Dr. Baksh and the PA Kristen are extremely kind and caring providers that will work with you and treat you like an individual, not just another person they have to see that day. The staff is also always friendly and make it a pleasant experience. I am very pleased with the care they've provided me with.|My husband has gone to this pain center for less than a year for severe back pain. Has yet to meet the dr. The PA is very rude and has no empathy for the fact that he has had pain for at least 20 years. She cut his meds in half and released him because ""he broke the rules"". He takes medical marijuana to help with the pain. I was with him at his first apt and the lady PA was very rude. If you have severe problems I would not recommend this pain clinic.|First impression as you get to the door is the big green sign warning you that they drug test randomly.  I went for an evaluation the reception ladies were nice enough and the nurse.  As for the P.A. that rude woman needs to learn how to be a decent respectful human being to their patients. She actually told me that I need to be  quiet she's speaking!  She talked at me not too me. Never again! Very unprofessional on her part.

I highly recommend this practice!|Dr. Patel is an outstanding pain management specialist. He combines a friendly demeanor with thorough knowledge, making every appointment comfortable and informative. His excellent bedside manner truly sets him apart. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking effective pain management solutions.|One of the main functions of a pain management office is managing prescriptions to medications.  This corporation and office often fails me miserably.  Several times now I've been left scrambling to contact the office to get something refilled or corrected.  Unfortunately, there is no direct way to contact the doctor via the phone.  The central call center you end up using for medication issues is frankly useless.  They claim to send a message to the doctor and then.. Nothing happens.  The only semi-reliable way to contact the doctor is through the online portal.|Amit  Patel is amazing. He fully explained my MRI results and the subsequent steps to take to get rid of my pain. His knowledge of lumbar spinal stenosis and cure is very extensive. Using pictures from my MRI and a model of the spine, he expertly and thoroughly, laid out a game plan for me to recover my life activity of pain-free walking, standing and better balance.
I left today after my visit full of hope that has sadly been absent for a good while.
Bravo Amit!|Office staff friendly, courteous and knowledgeable.  Amir Patel provided me information and thoroughly explained the issues and treatments available to me.  I truly entrust my care to Clearway Pain Solutions.

I am truly 90% better, even with spinal stenosis, I am now walking without a walker or cane.   It is so amazing, how much I've improved.

I see many negative reviews about being unable to contact office.  I always use the Patient Portal for refills and other info and have never had any delays or failure to respond to me.

Thank you Clearway Pain Solutions in Gambrills MD.|Great experience short wait time thorough understanding of what our next move would be. Dr Patel is an excellent doctor. He explains things very well in detail he listens to your reply and he also shows great concern for his patients. We need more doctors like him he is the best.

The caregivers are good and well qualified and the admin personnel have stabilized after some issues a couple of years ago. My primary complaint is that they drug test everyone every visit - it used to be ""random"" which was usually every other visit. As a long-term patient who has never failed a test, I find it a bit annoying that they test me every month which means my testing costs go up. Two years ago, I even had my insurance refuse to pay for the last test of the year because it was the 16th test (I also have kidney issues).|Very professional, very pleasant, she listened to the issues you're having  she let's you know how to solve the problems you're having|I've had a great experience as a patient here. Brandi is excellent and the staff is kind and professional. It's really nice to have a provider who listens and cares.|Never made it to see the doctor. This was my dad's first appointment at the Prince Frederick office. He is currently undergoing extensive treatment with another doctor. We arrived 20ish minutes before his appointment. Megan at the front desk asked for his referral. We informed her that his insurance does not require a referral. She began with ye,  it does. I explained the process for tricare select. Which does not require a referral. She then asked about paper. We did not receive anything via email. Her response well he will need to reschedule. I asked for the documents so I can fill them out for him. Her smart remark you won't have time to fill them out. His appointment is in 15 minutes. If your documents are not completly filled out we can not take him. As she continues to hold the documents and waste time. Ifilled in  the documents as stated with all info.Anythingg that did not pertain I didn't not fill out. We take the documents. She begins by this bo not being checked, and this box  is not checked, this box not checked. I said it does not pertain to him. ""Well you marked his parent are dead. At what age. And how."" Why does that pertain to his appointment. Mind you when questions like this are asked no one knows if this is a touchy subject for people. He just lost both his parents this year so this was not a good thing for him.  Why is this a question asked by pain management. I ask for the documents back because he obviously still had 10 minutes before his appointment. My dad at this point was in so much pain from being seen by his previous doctor he was ready to go. There were only 2 chairs to sit I. And we had to sit outside I. The hall to fill the forms. All in all. Have to find a new pain management doctor ad my dad is not comfortable. This girl was so rude. She kept saying it's not her. I'm sure the policy is not yours but your rude attitude is your own. Do Better. If I could give a zero I would. Not impressed at all.

I have been waiting for them to pivot after the recent staff change. I don't even think I can return here next month and will need to find a new practice before my next appt. I was a patient here for almost 7 years, the office used to be crowded over there next to the mall but the service and level of care was always top tier. James Hill was the best. Now he has left, I have seen 4 different practitioners, the front desk is occupied by an computer with rotating ppl coming on the screen. It would seem efficient except for when I'm waiting 20 min. For a bathroom key. Or the EXTREMELY rude virtual assistant ELIZABETH  who shut her screen off while I was talking lol it was like the equivalent of someone hanging up on you because you called their job and they didn't want to work that day.  Or how ALL staff is in the back of office and even when I'm yelling' can someone bring me bathroom key,  no one is coming to the front. Then they have the audacity to have a sign that say please don't knock on the door. The 2nd virtual assistant told me they couldn't help me and would call someone out.
When I called the billing department the lady adamantly told me I had to pay a $50 copay  eventhough I knew for a fact I didn't owe any copay due to my plan. Finally a young lady came out and beckoned someone to find the bathroom key  and figured out what was really going on with my patient account. (Wasnt a copay) then she scurried away behind the door yet to be seen again. I really wished things would've smoothed out by now. When James left I knew it would be a difficult transition but figured they would remain professional and I would continue our relationship. Sitting in an empty waiting room 1 hour and 15 mins after my scheduled appointment time, they must have decided to take an early lunch. Looking around one last time for the nostalgia, and realizing the waiting room is dingy and dusty everywhere. The owner should demand the building owner cleans the carpet at least. Surely they thought they would save some bucks and cut down on employees with this virtual assistant but I know they must be losing cause the whole setup is non functional for real life situations. Or the staff Is getting over on the owner by hiding out in the back not being attentive to patients/clients. Either way something is definitely Awry at this Choice Pain Location, and I won't be sticking around to subject myself to further mistreatment and I suggest you steer clear f4om this disappointment as well|Where you come from can be good and bad. At every place this group comes from in the healthcare industry they bring down with careless approach to medicine and nursing. Every facility they work in is an issue. Thru are falsify records or not providing decent care. This place does not answer phones, except in Gaithersburg , nurse practitioner threatened to cancel appointment if I did not come in early and was concerned zI was not taking enough pills for pain but did not counsel on a reduction of narcotics. When I asked her to switch providers she refused to put in chart and I later found out she did not put in prescription because I stated I wanted another provider. I had to report them for refusing to give me my medical records. Doctor was contacted, both ignored it. Doctor that works inside Medstar facility has a complaint against him by the DC Medical Board for not adhering to standards of a physician. It's on Google and it's published to public. There's to doctors, so you can see which one has the finding or complaint. Stay away from this practice. If you are dependent on ......, you may be persuaded to write a review but there's is no way they are accurate. Nurse practitioner sent out an assistant to listen to receptionist and or gd wanted to listen because they will pool together for any deception. It's my suspicion they came to Maryland because they are less regulated. But that's all about to end with Maryland Health Department under wrath.|I previously thought they cared and gave great customer service. The new staff and supervisors are HORRIBLE. They don't care about the patients needs. I will not be returning EVER.|This how they treat patients... Make you miss work for THEIR convenience. Don't send in your meds CONSTANTLY. Hang up on you MULTIPLE TIMES! Then make you wait on hold for THEM for at least 30 minutes! It's about their convenience not the convenience or needs of the patient!!!! I would be FIRED if I treated my patients like this!!!!!!! How are they still an operating practice? I think my next call will be to the board. Their providers are too busy trying to flirt than to do their jobs!

Since James left I don't know what happened to this place! Twice they were supposed to send in my meds and twice it never happened! I get called, told to leave my job as a nurse early, make arrangements, and they don't follow through on their job! This is horrible! I would never treat my own patients like this can't believe they do theirs like this.

James Hill helped me get my life back! I'm so happy to have found him and this clinic. Everyone here has been AMAZING! The staff is so friendly and so helpful. This is what you want in a pain clinic. Heck this is what you want in an office PERIOD! I cannot recommend them enough. I work in orthopedics and I will definitely be sending my own patients here!!!|So glad they have new staff here, once the front desk under Rochelle left it became a circus in both back and front office. I thought that I was given a thorough exam until the current staff took over a few months ago, the NA that I saw was a guy I do not recall his name but that was the most thorough, thoughtful and professional exam I've ever experienced since being in ANY pain management office and the LPN Shirley Frimprong is totally the best she actually listens does not try to force medication on you and take your concerns/feelings into consideration when coming up with a plan that meets your individual needs. I can only pray that whomever will be filling in for her while she's on maternity leave is as attentive and caring as she.  Wishing her a smooth/safe delivery and a healthy bundle of joy.|Dr. Hill is Awesome!!! It's nice to have a Doctor who spends time with you and your own situation, finds a solution that fits your needs to manage your month. Dr. Hill and his Staff are very respectful and treats they're patients with professionalism. I would definitely recommend seeking a consultation with Dr. Hill and his staff. It can change your life and the Quality that you Deserve!!! It certainly exceeded my expectations and more Dr. Hill is more then a Great Doctor he's a friend, Brother and someone I can talk to about whatever I'm going through on a monthly basis! Not much else I can say but pick up the phone and make an appointment and see for yourself!

DP|I don't even no where to start first of all I been calling since last week.when I received a call from the office manager Mohammad that once again they where no provider to see me for my appointment on July 25 1:45 2024 . But Dr obey would be sure to call my prescription in today no prescription they hung up on me I left over a 100 messages no response I had my right leg amputated failed out my wheelchair and barely can move now also I have back problem I'm in pain crying they stop taking my calls ignore me and do anyone know who I can call to complain and get help with these issues please|Not only did Dr.Hill help my severe pain that comes with my chronic pancreatitis, he listened to all my concerns. More so then any other pain specialist I've been too. His entire staff is a breath of fresh air. So welcoming, understanding and non judgmental ( like the last specialist I went too! ) I'm so thankful I found them!

In addition, I was prescribed 2 other medications that help me manage flare ups and reduce my pain to the lowest it's ever been in 10 years. I had given up on finding a medication for my pain, but Dr. Dombrowski was able to find the right combination that made all the difference. I could not recommend him and the fantastic staff at The Washington Pain Center highly enough!|I'm really lucky that I found The Washington Pain Center and Dr. Dombrowski. I have seen many specialist over the years, and I have experienced very little to no pain relief for my situation. However, after just one of the first medical suggestion, that Dr. Dombroski performed, I felt pain relief. And that pain relief extended and increase substantially throughout his treatment plan.

I'm not only grateful for the pain relief (& the amount of pain relief of which I've never experienced during my 7 years of seeing doctors and other specialist), but I'm grateful for his genuine interest in my wellbeing and his welcoming and caring personality. He's one of the first doctors that I have seen where I'm not afraid that I'm going to be turned away because they don't want to take the time to understand my pain and injuries or where I have to beg them not to give up on me - That is NOT the kind of doctor he is. He is the complete opposite, and I am so grateful. -- I could go on because there's so much more that I could say. But, I just want to emphasize to whoever reads this that he is a great doctor and a great person, and you should come in and see/experience it for yourself - you won't regret it.

Last thing I would like to note is, the front desk ladies are SO kind and helpful. They have the best customer service and are so sweet and genuinely care about you as well.|A great office! Dr. Dombroski listens very well and explains very well and skillfully does for you whatever is appropriate.  He is a very fine, caring, Knowledgeable and skilled doctor.  Staff is great too.  I heartily recommend this office.|John was straightforward, honest and good diagnostician of my issue. He was clear and direct about my options. Put things in plain English for me, and was thorough in covering the benefits and risks. For this alone I recommend him. That his treatment approach worked is why I wish there were 10 stars.|Dr Dombrowski, and everyone in this office is consistently friendly, helpful, and compassionate. It's always a pleasure visiting them, and for many of us, he is the final answer.

We have tried every modality out there to try to minimize and manage my back pain as well as my sciatica.  The nerve damage starts in my lower back and ends at my toes, so I have had a neurostimulator implanted which helps tremendously.  And just recently, I had the Viadisc procedure done in the hope that it would alleviate my back pain, and what a difference 3 months have made!  I wasn't sure it would work immediately after the procedure, because I was pretty uncomfortable for the first 3-4 weeks post-op.  But after about 4-6 weeks, I realized one morning that my back didn't hurt!  Since then, and for the most part, my back pain is so much better, except when it is really cold or really damp outside.  I am amazed and pleased at how well I am doing with respect to my lower back after the procedure. There are times I even forget I have pain, and that is success as far as I am concerned I would definitely recommend having the Viadisc procedure if Dr. Kahan thinks you are a good candidate.  Go through Dr. Kahan's office if you would like to discuss with me further.

And if you are looking for a pain management specialist, I strongly recommend Dr. Kahan and his entire team - Dr. Kahan listens to you, and will make recommendations he feels would be most suitable to your condition.  Kim Fern, PA-C is great, and the entire staff does everything possible to work with you to arrange appointments, schedule procedures and make sure you have completed all paperwork whenever necessary.  If you have chronic pain, I strongly recommend you contact the Kahan Center for Pain Management.|Dr. Kahan and his staff go out of their way to make me comfortable and to take care of my pain. I leave there happy because I know will be pain free. Outstanding practice.|I have been going to pain mgmt doctors for at least 15 years.  Hands down Dr. Kahan is the best!  He will not stop until he finds the most effective solution to managing your pain.  His  staff is awesome as well.|I have attended two courses at the Kahan Center. Dr. Kahan has been an amazing teacher. I have been able to gain a lot of insightful tips and tricks to help improve my injection technique. What sets his course apart is that you don't feel rushed. His courses are kept to small groups which allows you to spend an ample amount of time practicing. Dr. Kahan will spend as much time as you need to feel comfortable and confident in performing the injections. I highly recommend his courses to anyone with an interest in gaining further knowledge in interventional pain management. Thanks Dr. Kahan!|Excellent course! Great experience working 1 on 1 with Dr. Kahan, learning techniques I've adopted in my practice. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning these skills.|I attended Dr. Kahan's advanced radiofrequency ablation course and would highly recommend this course. It's very hands-on, and with the small volume, I was able to work on the things I needed and never felt rushed. There is no doubt that Dr. Kahan is a highly skilled and experienced proceduralist. More relevant perhaps to this course is that Dr. Kahan is an outstanding teacher and takes the time to answer questions and personalize the content to meet the individual candidate's goals. Attending this course will ensure you feel comfortable and confident in performing these procedures.|The course was excellent. It was comprehensive and provided terrific didactic and hands on instruction.  Dr. Kahan is an outstanding teacher.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn lumbar injection techniques.|They're going here to see Dr.Kahan for 23+ years. The doctor has always been willing to help me and went over and beyond to help me as the ladies in the office have as well they're always very cheerful kind people that work there What are the ladies Pam even came outside one day and jump started my car or try to jumpstart my car for me! That's a real service I told you they go over and above trying to help all their patients in any way they can.

Why?  Because.....
1.) I always spend a LONG time on the phone whenever I call them.
2.) They have a call center answering service and they're not helpful.
3.) The last visit I had, I was called and asked if I could come in earlier for my appointment because the doctor had some cancellations. So I arrived 1 hour early. I waited in the waiting room for 40 minutes before we got called back.  We then got called back and waited another 30 minutes for the doctor. We spent over an hour waiting.....WHY would they call me to come in early just to wait for more than an hour??!
The doctor saw us, left and said he'd come back. He did not come back.  I had to ask the nurse and he never came back. The nurse gave me my referral for my MRI and we left.
4.) I got home and realized they never gave me my referral for my physical therapy.
5.) I called and they said they would mail me my referral for my physical therapy. They NEVER mailed it to me.
6.)  I had to drive back to the office and pick up my physical therapy referral because they did NOT mail it to me AND they forgot to give it to me when I was at my appointment.|The Dr's and the staff are always kind, understanding, caring and professional.|""Everyone"" always has a smile to share when I enter the door until the time I leave.

She did a FULL exam on the areas which brought me to see her and explained to me why that area was in pain and went over opioid medication use ( educational ) I just realized there is a clinic closer to my home but guess what ? I'd rather drive additional miles for her care !|The one on Wilkins does not care at all just want money. I didn't know my insurance was inactive and went in was told that the provider can see me for 375$ which I didn't have then was told they will send me a 30 day prescriptions until next my appointment. Then the next day she said no. How can you Tell a me in your office that you willl send me something so by the next time I will be fine because my insurance will be back. Supervisor don't call you back. I'm the 3rd person who has said something about this provider|This choice clinic is unprofessional and  does not return patients calls .charge your insurance company and does not fully do they job.only thing they care about is money.and not the patients. My claim willake it to medical board and attorney general office this week|I am discussed Ms emmanuella okpah is the worst they called me 20 minutes before my appointment this morning and cancelled and said my prescription would be sent today I specifically told the lady do not send to the pharmacy on file I gave her the address for the new pharmacy they sent to the old pharmacy anyway I been calling since 11:00 am they finally answered around 11:30 and said it was cancelled and being sent to new pharmacy and I would have it today guaranteed I just got back off the phone with them and by the way I talked to them 7 times and choice pain closes at 5:pm the lady told me that she don't know if I will get it today yet the 5 previous people I spoke with assured me it would be there now she saying I have to wait until tomorrow even though it was they mistake they sent to the wrong pharmacy I am in terrible pain and I have no medicine!!!!|The doctor and the nurses were very professional, understanding, and with courtesy. The doctor and nurses made me feel very welcomed as if he really does care and have my best interest at heart. I'm not just a patient, but a person. Thank you, and yes I would highly recommend the doctor.|Well I have had a couple of bad experiences in the clinic. The first one was I was downstairs waiting for the elevator and by the time I got up to the office I was told that I was late and had to reschedule I explained that I was waiting for elevator and I was told but you wasn't in the office. Well I talked to my doctor and he didn't agree with the assistant. The other time was the mix up on my appointment date but the issue was corrected. For the most part the staff is always pleasant and helpful . My doctor is the greatest . Dr. Ronald Shin always pleasant , always show concern and will listen to you no matter what it concern . Dr. Shin  is the GREATEST|Dr Shin is easily one of the best doctors I've met or been treated by.  When he and I met I had tremendous pain in my lower back which had been treated for 8 years due to a vehicle accident.  Many doctors had failed to lessen my pain without enormous levels of drugs.  Dr Shin treated me with a procedure that had been refused by another Dr years prior.  As of now I'm happy to say my recovery has been terrific.  My back pain is miniscule and we have a plan to keep it that way.  I would recommend him for any back pain without hesitation.  I'm 16lbs lighter and moving well again.

I loved his professionalism and pinpointing my problems.   However I have tried to get a follow up from that injection and every time I call, the receptionist puts me through to the office manager who does not answer or return my calls.  This has been going on since October 2024.  The office manager will not return my call so I can follow up from my last injection from Dr. Soudan or allow the receptionist to make an appointment for me.  I don't feel that it is Dr. Soudan, I feel it is the office manager.  I was first a patient at Bowie and when Dr. Closson left Bowie, they sent me to Columbia.  I ended up asking that my records and me be transferred to Columbia from Bowie because I love Dr. Siudan.  Bowie transferred my records.   But now the office manager at Columbia refuses to allow me to come back for my follow-up or to make an appointment for my next injection.  If anyone knows how you can get in touch with the Director of this facility, please share it.|I love the personable atmosphere of the location and the staff at the Columbia, Md., National Spine and Pain center. Dr. Sudan is the best! Tamika is, a wonderful person who really listens to your problems and help you to get the best care needed in a timely manner!|My initial appointment with Dr Soudan, I immediately felt he was not taking me serious at all. Upon him reading the different diagnosis that attributes to the severe pain I endure daily. Dr Soudan verbally downplayed how serious the issues and the pain I deal with daily, by telling me ""I think they misdiagnosed you having SLE Lupus and Peripheral neuropathy "". I looked at him and told him I had seen many specialist, Rheumatologist, Neurologist, Hematologist, and my PCP. They then diagnosed me with SLE Lupus, amongst other diagnoses. I felt humiliated because I was there for help and relief for some of the pain I deal with daily, to be treated like I'm some addict seeking drugs. The straw that broke the camels back was the most recent visit, I asked to speak to the Ofc Mgr and after speaking to her, verbalizing my concerns, she sends in Dr Soudan. He entered the treatment room clearly annoyed. He had the audacity to tell me I can find another Doctor. He is the Medical Director there. I asked him why? Because I am advocating for myself and you all have had me on the same medication since 2022, with which my body has become prone to and their is really no relief of the severe pain I endure daily?! He proceeds to tell me "" I do not increase no one's medication, you can find another Doctor."" I told him I just want to get help for the pain I suffer, and they are the closet facility to my home. He was verbally disrespectful and I asked him what happened to your bedside manner?! I also elaborated that I too was a former health care practitioner. He proceeds to say ""y'all are the worst to try to treat"". I was not only dissatisfied, I couldn't believe he was so nonchalant and gave me all the verbiage that he cared to NOT treat or help me. He then proceeds to verbalize to me ""I don't treat Lupus, go to your Rheumatologist"". I told him based on all the Specialist I had seen, my PCP referred me to pain management. I have made a complaint, praying something changes for the better, for future patients. Finally, I told him I'm usually a very friendly person and I've had conversations with other patients in the waiting room, and other patients indicated their meds had been increased, but it took a lot of request, some even elaborated that they feel they are getting relief. Then I knew it was a bias against a certain persuasion of patients. All I want is some relief with regards to the chronic pain I suffer daily. It's unfair that some Doctor's stereotype certain people because of their own biases. I've had many injections and tried many different treatments, and suggested procedures at other facilities to no avail. I'm at the point to just give up hope with regards to getting proper care and treatment for the pain I deal with daily that affects my DLA. I've seen many different Doctors with NSPC since 2013, after I had several blood clots in my lungs in 2012, then came all the different diagnosis. I must say several Doctor's did try to give me some relief. ATP I'll just deal with the pain, rather than be verbally disrespected and made to feel like I don't deserve proper treatment, and be kicked out by the ""Director"" of the Columbia facility I was referred to. It's sad that the empathetic bed side manner has gone out the window since the pandemic. Many Doctors(NOT all) seem to be preoccupied with their own lives and are doing the bare minimum to truly accommodate patients. When I advocate for myself I was casted out like I don't matter, and or mean nothing to said Director. I have another upcoming appointment with the NP. She verbalized she has been trying to advocate for me, but Dr Soudan is firm with regards to not increasing my pain meds. I've decided to be treated as a human being, I'll transfer to another facility. Good luck, if you deal with chronic pain and are seeking relief and help, and you're melanated and go to the Columbia office. I pray you don't  be verbally disrespected, humiliated and made to feel like you're just some junky seeking drugs.|When I moved here I had to find a new doctor to take over my treatment. Dr. Soudan listened to my problems and has helped me have quality of life. Front desk is patient and helpful. Couldn't recommend him and his staff more!|Dr. Soudan was incredibly dismissive of me today at my first appointment and only spent five minutes with me after I waited almost an hour and a half in their waiting room. I have neck pain that has disabled me to the point of needing to take medical leave from my job, and global pain due to a connective tissue disorder I have. He immediately on entering the room and hearing this told me ""We don't treat global pain. Unless imaging can find something mechanically wrong in your neck, we cannot treat your pain."" He then laughed a bit and said ""And since you're only what, 21?"", Implying that it was unlikely there was anything wrong with me because I am young. Firstly, he got my age wrong - I am 23, so evidently he didn't check my paperwork. Secondly, I informed him that due to my disorder, many of my joints were mechanically damaged.

He then told me to see a rheumatologist for my pain since it was due to connective tissue, which I told him I had done in the past and then was dismissed from their practice since my connective tissue disorder was not arthritic or inflammatory. He had the audacity to try and correct me saying that connective tissue disorders ARE inflammatory, which they are not! (At least not mine.) I told him the only inflammation in my disorder is from microinjuries due to instability from connective tissue laxity, and it is not rheumatic or autoinflammatory whatsoever. He then went silent on that topic and soon left the room to write my referral, and never returned to the room personally.

My PCP referred me here specifically to be treated for my pain. It is a pain clinic. Of course they CAN treat my pain, they just won't. I left this appointment with no options given to me for ways they could help with pain management, only a referral for an MRI where the doctor misspelled my (very basic and common) first name multiple times. He clearly didn't read any of the 50 freaking pages of paperwork they had me fill out before my appointment in which I was very detailed. I was condescended to based on my age, I was ""corrected"" about my own disability which the doctor was wrong about, and I was sent out of the office crying because I am so sick of being ping-ponged between doctors who are unwilling to help me and insist on referring me to someone else to deal with me.

If you have any kind of complex medical history, don't see Dr. Soudan, especially if you are young. He was very explicit that he ONLY treats spinal issues, and clearly thought that my pain was minimal simply due to my age. It is not. I am in an 8 or 9/10 pain many evenings each month and average a 5 or 6/10 pain every single day.|Absolute horrible service scheduled me multiple times for injections each time they canceled my Appointment and on the last visit they had me waiting in the waiting room for a hour after my scheduled appointment. They said the doctor had a meeting that is so unprofessional of Ashish g shanbhag. Treating her time like it's more valuable than mine. If you scheduled appointment honor it. there's no reason for a doctor to have you waiting in the waiting room for over an hour while she talks on the phone.|My appointment for the injections was at 1:30pm, and they asked me to arrive At 1pm. I arrived on time, and it was already past 3:15pm when I left the place. absolute horrible service. they had me waiting in the waiting room to long. I feel I wasn't taken seriously the first and last time I visited this office. I never returned and would not recommend this office.|I feel I wasn't taken seriously the first (and last) time I visited this office. I wasn't seen until an hour after my initial appointment time even though I was on time. I've suffered 2 stress fractures of the spine in a one-year span with no particularly traumatic mechanism of injury involved. As a young adult who really shouldn't be sustaining these kinds of injuries, I was pretty disappointed by the lack of concern and options I had been given. Literally every other doctor I've consulted about this has said the frequency and MOI of these injuries is abnormal for someone my age (and I agree.  It's affected my quality of life a great deal as a physically active person). Yet, all Dr. Soudan had to offer me was an anti-inflammatory prescription. Even after insisting that the lifestyle advice I was being given was already part of my normal routine, there was seemingly nothing more integrative or aggressive that could be done for me, not even suggestions for blood panels. The cherry on top was being told by Dr. Soudan that I should schedule my follow-up for 4 weeks after that initial meeting. During checkout just a few moments later, I was told it would be almost 3 months til I could be seen again. I never returned and would not recommend this office.

My work insurance company that my money goes into chose a doctor that DID NOT CARE enough to see what was right in front of him and said I did not need pain management after 2 year of not healing. The doctor I went to and for a 2nd opinion was met with resentment but my independent 2nd opinion Dr.Brouilette sent me for an MRI which indicated the problem of a herniated disc and had given the only and viable option.  His experience & expertise has rendered me so much relief from pain and I am absolutely GRATEFUL.  Thank you, to the excellent staff, Angela Barnes CRNP & Dr. Brouilette Thank you for your experience, compassion & professionalism.|Everyone is nice and helpful. I feel so much better today after my treatment yesterday. Thank you Dr B and your crew. I've been going here for about 3 years now.

I did not have a long wait in waiting room which is spacious and comfortable. The nurse practitioner was very nice and so knowledgeable in helping me with my problems. I am very pleased with my experience.|The center's staff has cared for my mental and physical health day 1 of my visit. Doctor Brouillette and NP Barnes are great! They ask questions, listen to you and not only inform you of what's going on with you but they ask if you have any suggestions on your treatment. I love the office staff and everyone's commitment to their job. The service is exemplary.|I love Dr. B and the entire staff.  Everyone is very friendly.  I have been with this office location since 2013 and I have had so many good experiences.   I am a chronic pain sufferer with many multi auto immune conditions.   Every provider that I have seen there has listened and come up with a plan and if that plan doesn't work, they come up with a different plan.  I miss Lilli Walker, PA but Angela Barnes,  NP is really learning my case and I'm getting to know her as well.  I appreciate all the time that everyone pours into the office and my case.  Thank you for being so amazing!|My first experience was not bad. Dr. B. was very nice and listened to concerns. Super happy to finally find someone who I felt comfortable with. However, I didn't know after the first meeting, I would follow up with one of the PAs from that point on. The problem is I cannot do regular work duties and I need a doctor's note stating my limitations. I submitted an example letter from my surgeon to make it easier. The letter was not written with specifics which is the reason why I keep asking them to do it over again. Now Dr. A. insisted the letter is good. I called and emailed multiple times but made no traction. Find a place that respects your health and value your business.|This office treats my fiance who is a patient here so bad. They ignore him, make him wait for hours for no reason to be seen. They denied him the right to see the actual doctor when the doctor told him just to make a request to see him if needed. They responded that is not how it works here. Right now we are waiting for his discharge papers since he found a better practice to go to next month and they literally have made him wait for almost an hour for no reason. Worst place ever. Would not recommend coming here.|I called and changed my appointment from 1:45 to 11:00 on 2/15/23. All that happened was my appointment at 1:35 was canceled. This is the second time I have changed an appointment and was told what I had requested was done. The last time my appointment was 3 days wrong. This caused me to be out of medication for 3 days.

(she had to walk by me to get into the office). The front office manager is rude and it has become clear that all this practice cares about is money and not about patient care.

Current situation, due to delayed order of 10 mg oxycodone, by the manufacturer,  it was undetermined when it will be available, but they have 5 mg available, which was to last 30 days it was advised to take when needed and/or  5mg every 6 hrs, but the 10 mg are now available. So with a spine surgery coming.up L1-L5 and sciatica and then in 8 weeks, a  total knee replacement,  I am in chronic pain everyday cause  I am the primary caretaker of my 88 yr old mother with dementia and I really have no standby,  I don't know how much longer I can get by being neglectful and her needs due to stairs (split foyer. walking bending, sleeping. household chores.  Everything is a struggle  I i told Dr Hill all about my situation l  I can't afford assisted living nor nursing home.

So please don't let me go 2 weeks without pain meds, the medical profession knows this because this is not sufficient of my regular refill  and very oncerning to me due to abruptly stopping this medication. You need to gradually wean off it, withdrawals can be dangerous and not easy, might even have visit to  emergency room to get stabilize if it gets that bad.
When only a new script can be written (the pharmist said that would be acceptable) and sent to pharmacy within 10-15 minutes of my original monthly refill.
Please reconsider my situation and what level of pain I have everyday,  I am expecting a phone call back tomorrow.   I just want a normal quality life back again I should.have the 2 surgeries taken care of by December. I  apologize for this very very  long review and I hope one of the Dr's reads  this and continues to manage my pain like it has been from the beginning. Thank you so much and God bless.
Overall this practice has been great. With 1 exception.
Please advise.|I gave it one because you can't give it -0. Dr Shockley is the ONLY good thing about this place. The Rosedale location has a VERY unsanitary restroom. Cross contamination ALL OVER the place!! Dr Shockley needs to be told about the ""policy"" of having people come in EVERY 2 weeks instead of being discharged! I had a UA back in JUNE that was questionable. I wasn't told untill August, when the ruling body of Khyanne returned from Kenya! Then she had me coming every 2 weeks, for 12 weeks I did it! Then the last UA somehow contained Methadone AND Suboxone!! I know what those medications are used for and DON'T have access to them. Khyanne however does, with her specialty being MAT (Medication Assisted Treatment) for getting off meds like Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Dilaudid etc. BEWARE FOLKS, the next ""bad UA"" could be yours!
Dr Shockley is wonderful, and knew just how to get around A LOT of scar tissue to do a lumbar epidural! He is GREAT!!!|I can't imagine how anyone couldn't like or recommend Mr. Hill! He's efficient, quick, explains everything thoroughly, actually researches your conditions/treatments, loves to consult with other providers for adequate and continuum of care, he's caring, empathetic and I can say so much more. But above all those things, the best thing I love about him is that no matter how much pain you're in and how hard it is to bare, he always seems to make you smile and laugh. He takes interest in you as a person and not just a patient. I highly recommend him, and it's always a pleasure seeing him on my appointment days.

(You don't get to tell me what I think or feel). I have been his patient for over 10 years, and he had previously been an excellent, kind person who listened to patients. Clearly something happened because others have reported, he does have an acerbic, aggressive bedside manner. In all my appointments, he misstated facts and talked down to me (a woman of color) repeatedly, something demonstrated in research is a real problem with women seeking pain tx.  A year ago, Hough did a routine left hip injection that resulted in an unusual side effect which numbed my leg--not unusual in that it happened, unusual in the length of time. I've had the hip injected many times without issue.  Hough maintained then as he does now that it had nothing to do with his injection. I've had this same hip, same area injected 8 times under ultrasound guidance, and instead of outright saying he would not do the hip injection again a yr later, he sent me on a goose chase of additional imaging, which was negative (I told him it would be negative), and additional appointments. He actually changed his records to reflect a ""clinical finding of back pain,"" despite telling him it was my hip and that rheum + ortho confirmed HIP. But for pain management, I was willing to jump through his hoops--finding pain management isn't easy and oral steroids+opiods is terrible for long term tx.. I was and am concerned he was repeatedly twisting my words and constantly interrupting me, even after asking him to allow me to finish, but even with my husband present, he talked over me, then called ME adversarial. Disagreeing isn't adversarial, especially when he has incorrect information, and all patients should be interested in ensuring physicians have accurate information. Hough was supposed to obtain records from the 8 other injections, and failed to do so. He then stated that he was not willing to do the procedure--WHY the hoops and WHY not tell me that four appointments ago? He was unprepared for the appointment. Although he maintains his injection was no where near any nerves that would cause temporary leg numbness, the only reason he would both refuse to continue to treat, while assuring me the leg numbness wasn't his procedure, was that he in fact committed medical malpractice. He made no attempts to find out why it happened, and then blamed me for ""not trusting him"" when he came unprepared and with incorrect information.  As such, I have reported him to my insurer, to his professional board and to the Maryland oversight agency to investigate. This provider has no care for patients anymore--I don't know what happened--but if you are a woman or person of color, you should exercise caution as this physician is dangerous and causes harm in what he did to me--gaslight, cause harm, talk over you, raise his voice, and dismiss you. I've seen other reviews consistent with my own experiences with him in 2024 and 2025. Ironically, he responds to Google reviews faster than portal messages or patient requests.|I have been seeing Dr Hough on and off since 2012. He has always been an exceptional provider. I came in for a joint injection, a procedure that has been done a dozen times and that was confirmed as a *procedure* with Sandy.  Dr Hough said the ""never so that,"" which has not been my experience, and if I had known that, I would have requested a virtual appointment as I am bedbound and getting to appointments is extremely difficult and painful.  So instead of the procedure, he flat out refused to do it, ordered an MR, and sent me on my way.

What is especially frustrating was that he was so cold and unkind about it. He knows my history  and that I've been a pain patient for years to an inflammatory autoimmune disease.  No other treatment options were provided other than my regular opioids, which is obviously terrible long term pain *management.*

What absolutely shocked me was that I was visibly upset and crying, and he literally could not care less. He was almost frazzled and frustrated, which was crazy because EYE am the one in pain and in need of a very routine injection that rheumatology has done and that he has done.

It's fine to disagree, but it's never okay to dismiss a patient's pain, to be so thoughtless, uncaring and unkind.  No alternatives were discussed or offered.|Office got me in immediately. Dr Hough was very compassionate with my pain. And worked me very quickly to get me some pain relief at first appointment. And has continued to help for weeks afterwards. He immediately answered many questions I had through patient portal. Nothing but great things to say about Dr Hough and his Staff was fantastic.|I went to see Dr Hough after having an unsuccessful back surgery  that left me with the same amount of extraordinary pain if not worse. Dr. Hough had a very cold, and curt bedside manner. He ordered me to have a CT scan which three days later after the scan, I had to call his office to get the results on unfortunately. He then had his assistant call me who simply stated,"" The procedure I had done by the other doctor was done correctly"". Dr. Hough knew how much pain I am in as he had to order a controlled substance for me to be able to lie down flat in order to take the CT scan,yet he didn't even have the decency to call me back himself and spend the time with me explaining what he saw on the scan. His assistant basically told me there was nothing he is prepared to do other than what he has done and I should see my regular physician and tell him that I have osteoporosis. I feel after this experience with Dr. Hough,that he at  no time showed any care or compassion for me as a human being or his patient.|Dr Hough is exceptional in his field. We met at the hospital about 10 years ago while admitted for 2 disc that were unbearable. He explained the injection in my spine. Answered all of my scary questions, gave me prognosis of others he had done this procedures & said I would have to come office a couple more times to his office. He even agreed to have my mother & church officials to come in prayer hospital room to have prayer first recognizing that he his a great physician but God is the greatest physician I also had an extreme situation in the early part of covid. We did video calls and one visit to his office that was extremely difficult to ride in car to office. His staff was awesome. They got a wheel chair and took me outside with a smile... I'll never forget it. It took a while of tryinag different measures but we finally got there. I'm not easily impressed by Drs but I completely trust him & that says a lot coming from. Thank you Dr Hough for who you are.|Thank you Dr. Hough!  Your knowledge and experience guided you to the right place for the administration of the shot in my back to completely relieve me of the pain I was experiencing!  I had the best night's sleep the night after you administered the shot that I've had in the past several months!   Thanks again!!!|From my first call, trying to get my new patient appointment, I was treated respectfully and helped immediately.  The office staff was professional, friendly and helpful.  The doctor educated me and explained what my pain was being caused by.  He took a great deal of time with me and showed me images on the computer that explained and supported his findings. The doctor's assistant during the epidural steroid injection was calming and reassuring.  The information email, complete with video exercises to do at home is fantastic.|Been a patient for quite a few years.

He has the unusual combination of being extremely knowledgeable and also very caring and thoughtful!! He has years experience in helping with pain problems. He has made my life much better! His caring ways are definitely reflected in his staff -- they are very professional and kind!!|I first saw Dr Abed about 2 years ago for an injection for neck pain. It was the first time I had significant relief. I have had injections from another Dr that didn't help at all. Dr Abed and staff.are all very pleasant.   Dr Abed also gave me some helpful advice on things to help my neck. I'm going again in a few weeks.

This is a couple of years after my last 5 star review.
I know that the staff has had some major changes but what I experienced recently is uncalled for. I called and asked for a revised referral because Advanced Radiology had a problem with the referral had. I asked the lady I spoke with to either mail or email it to me and she acted like I was asking for something difficult. She finally agreed to email it to me. She may have but I never received it. I finally stopped in and picked up my new referral.  Took all of 5 minutes so I don't know what the big deal was about emailing or mailing it to me. First time I've ever been disappointed with Dr Abed's staff. I hope his staff isn't going the way of so many other good Drs. It would be a shame.|Dr Abed and his staff are amazing. Everyone was so attentive, kind , and caring .
I'm so happy to have been referred to Dr Abed.
He is such a kind , compassionate, caring and down to earth man . So refreshing to go to a Dr that truly cares and listens . I've already referred patients to him and will continue to do so .|My neurosurgeon referred me to Dr Abed to get a spinal injection to put off surgery. They got me right in, got my injection and I am feeling great. A few weeks later, I felt this horrible pain in my back so Dr Abed sent me to get an MRI and he notified me that I had fractured  the L5 vertebrate. Within days, the office arranged for me to have a procedure Kyphoplasty to restore the damaged vertebras height and relieve the excruciating pain.  Dr Abed and his staff are awesome. All of my procedures were painless and done in a professional setting. They show alot of concern for their patients and I highly recommend Dr. Abed to anyone in need of pain management!!!

I was not allowed to speak to the doctor and after about 9 months in dealing with this NP (Non Professional) she simply fired me! Go figure! I'm in constant pain, have several severe medical conditions, and after we but heads each visit, she cancelled my account! Period!|I always receive good care at this office. Dr Ward has performed several surgeries on my knee which has improved my pain. I'm also pleased with the staff and the N P Kattie Lovett.|Staff laughed and talked to a pharm rep but whenever there was patient interaction the vibe changed like we patients were a burden. I stood for 15 minutes with no interaction. Finally asked if there was something i needed to do to check in. Given forms. Then tablet. Tablet experience was horrible. Dr Ward was nice but staff would not give me an appointment for a procedure as he instructed. So I'm left to suffer. NEVER am able to get a person on the phone. No voice-mail setup. Just disconnected. Not the kind of place I want to manage my pain.|The doctor was really nice but trying to get in contact with someone in this office sucks. They use these answering services and don't return calls.  I've even gone to the office the guy seem bothered that I was there trying to get my medical record fixed that they messed up. He didn't know who could fix it, the doctor was gone for the day. He said he would leave a message for them to call me, 2weeks later and still no call and at this point I'm trying to figure out who to contact for them falsifying my medical records!|Dr. Ward is fantastic and understood my condition. I ran into a problem getting my medicine filled and I checked several pharmacies. I stopped by the office and spoke with a very friendly medical assistant at the front desk. I wish I had her name. She made one phone call and found a pharmacy nearby that had my medicine in stock. She saved me from going through so much more pain that I know I would not have been able to endure. Thank you!!!!!|Professional and friendly staff, No long waiting time. The Doctor is excellent. He is experienced and compassionate.

Also after reading reviews showing doctor Murray. Even my psych doctor wouldn't talk to him via phone ( which he got upset and accused her of trying to get me hooked on benzos) because she stated he was too unprofessional and the way he spoke to me she didn't want to talk to him. He talked to staff the same way with such disregard. I gotten a surgery for weight-loss and he said to me you'll have problems ( in which i didn't) Hey told me that another one of his white patients died from overdose being on the same medicine I'm on in which had me terrified but like my psych doctor said SHE OVERDOSES which meant she took more than needed. She was trying to explain to him that a overdose is a overdose and if a patient don't take meds out of term then it won't happen. He kept disagreeing and told her she's just a NPC and he's a MD. HE'S gone now but I got anxiety EACH VISIT with him. SO GLAD HE'S GONE. IMMA TAKE ANOTHER STAR JUST FOR HIM|Excellent professional!! This provider has great bedside manner. She calmed my concerns, gave the care I needed and follow up was right on time.|Staff is friendly...Dr Bruce Abraham answered all my questions and concerns feel very comfortable with talking and discussing my health concerns and medications....|The minute  you walk in the staff greet with a smile then the service in the back is very fast and friendly  and they listen to your concerns|I went to the Choice Pain on Reisterstown Road. I had only one bad experience with this site.  The doctor I saw was belligerent and condescending.  I voice my displeasure with him and instructed the staff to not schedule me with that particular physician. after that interaction they matched me with a much better caregiver.  They worked well with us when we moved out of state to North Carolina and had to come back to Baltimore to be seen by Doctor McCutchens.  They were very accommodating because we were coming so far to be seen.  I would like to say thank you all for making a difficult situation much more tolerable.|I had an incredibly disappointing and unprofessional experience during my visit at CHOICE Pain & Rehabilitation Center on Reisterstown Rd. in Baltimore MD, with the CRNP, Murray Obanye.  I arrived with high hopes, carrying over 150 pages of extensive medical records, including diagnostic tests, previous doctor diagnoses, MRI's, CT scans, ultrasounds, X-rays, medication histories, and more.

To begin with, this doctor failed to show any genuine concern or professionalism.  He didn't even bother to take a cursory glance at the extensive medical documentation I had brought with me (which I had to PAY to get from all of my previous doctors & specialist). Instead, he immediately judged me based on my appearance (I have tattoos) and age, and proceeded to dismiss me and my condition, which is anything but trivial, and suggested that I seek another doctor who might be ""more willing to prescribe pain management medication.""

To make matters worse, he didn't take my situation seriously at all and cut me off mid- explanation to then suggested that ""I get an inhaler for my chest pain from my primary care physician instead of seeking pain management"".  Had he taken the time to review ANY of my medical records, he would have realized the severity of my condition.  My records clearly show the presence of masses and tumors in my chest, which should not be addressed with a mere inhaler.

Furthermore, the doctor's lack of assessment of the portion of my records that showed my medication history, was completely off base.  I was not seeking medication as a first resort; in fact, I had previously explored nonconventional treatments under the guidance of my previous pain management specialist while living in CA. My move to a new area prompted my search for a new doctor, NOT an eagerness for prescription drugs....

Perhaps the most disheartening part of the appointment was when the Dr. openly LAUGHED at me and at my situation. This unprofessional behavior was not only hurtful but also extremely unbecoming of someone who calls themselves a ""medical professional"".

While I was in the middle of trying to explain to him of my condition to the best of my ability, the doctor walked out of the room, and returned about 10 minutes later and handed me a printout of another pain management specialist and casually suggested that I might have better luck getting prescribed something there. This complete lack of empathy, understanding, and professionalism was disheartening and disappointing.

Medical conditions can affect anyone, regardless of age, appearance, race, or sexual orientation. Patients should not face preconceived biases. This experience highlights the importance of consistent professionalism and ethics in healthcare, treating all patients with respect regardless of their appearance.
Not to mention, I was charged $170.00 for my initial appointment regardless of the fact that they conducted ZERO test and the doctor gave me MAYBE 2 minutes of his time, after I waited for over an hour to be seen by the CRNP, Murray Obanye.

I STRONGLY advise for ANYONE who's seeking genuine medical care to really think twice before considering this doctor, and I'd recommend avoiding CHOICE Pain & Rehabilitation Center's together as a whole. My experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I hope that my review helps others avoid the same ordeal.
I am now being seen and treated by Greater Maryland Pain Management and have not a single bad thing to say about them.  I'd start there and avoid this mess of situation you'll most likely end up in if seen by Murray Obanye.|Lovely front desk and staff, however,  the CRNP, Murray Obanye, treated me like I was a drug seeker! Because he cannot see my pain on my scans, he basically told me I don't have pain. If you're a patient with Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease, or any invisible illness, DO NOT GO! This man laughed at me and told me I just have opioid dependency! I've been a chronic pain patient for 5 yrs (so obviously, my body is dependent on the medicine) After being bed ridden for 6 months and almost losing my job, I agreed to go to pain management and pain meds gave me my life back! I went from 0 quality of life, to being, gratefully, able to go back to work and care for my family. How hurtful for a doctor to tell you nothing is wrong with you, and basically, in other words, call me a liar! I wish I could switch bodies with some of these Dr's who took an oath to treat patients with chronic pain.",2024-11-19|2024-11-13|2024-11-12|2024-11-22|2024-11-15|2024-01-13|2023-11-07|2023-07-13,5|1|5|5|4|5|1|1,,,"11 a.m.|1 p.m.|12 p.m.",54.4|53.6|53.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do they believe in pain meds","Yes and they do other types of pain thearpy as well.",short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJsYcVuDsbyIkRhOPCeTCH1XM,86

He observed my condition, asked questions, listened to my answers, and responded with medication and a prescription for physical therapy (which was available in the same Point Performance office).  Over a period of several months, my condition got markedly better.  When the condition subsequently recurred, he observed the condition and offered additional treatment, which seems to have helped a lot.  I am grateful for Dr. Majeed's careful attention and calm, personal approach.|Service provision by Dr. Suros and his staff was fine. Unfortunately, the immediate relief that lumbar epidural typically provide did not occur and I've had pain not only immediately after the procedure but in the subsequent days. My follow up is not until sometime in February, which is two or three weeks away thus I will be contacting me Point performance medicine to determine my next course of action.
As always service was courteous, professional, and informative.|I found Dr. Majeed through a referral from my orthopedist, who suggested I see him for his creative and holistic approach to healing, which has made a lasting impression on me.

When I first reached out to Dr. Majeed, I was recovering from a long and deeply traumatizing medical crisis. My previous doctors had told me that my life and career aspirations were too lofty given my complex medical situation. I was living with new chronic pain that felt insurmountable with traditional medical approaches and was struggling to find a doctor who understood my unique needs and challenges.

From our first meeting, Dr. Majeed validated my experiences with empathy and dedication, and I found his demeanor to be remarkably gentle. He is a patient listener, making it easy to discuss even the most challenging topics without ever feeling dismissed or unheard. Scheduling appointments with Dr. Majeed is remarkably efficient, and his office staff are both quick to respond and highly professional, ensuring a seamless experience. He approached my care with innovative solutions tailored to my needs, seamlessly blending his expertise in psychiatry and interventional pain management. Because of his extensive training, Dr. Majeed neither diminishes the challenges of psychological pain nor those of physical pain. This unique combination allows him to address the emotional, physical, and social aspects of health in a comprehensive manner, ensuring well-rounded care. This personalized approach has made me feel truly supported throughout my recovery journey.

Since working with Dr. Majeed, my symptoms have become significantly more manageable, allowing me to focus on my personal hopes and aspirations. Dr. Majeed's approach has not only met but exceeded my expectations by fostering a collaborative and affirming relationship. He has played a pivotal role in helping me thrive in grad school, something I was told by other doctors would not be possible given my complex medical situation. His care has renewed my confidence in pursuing my goals while managing my health, allowing me to approach life with a sense of resilience and possibility I hadn't imagined.

To my disabled kin reading this: Dr. Majeed is one of the few doctors I have found who affirms the mind-body connection we understand so well as a community. I rarely feel this aligned with a doctor, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. His creative, knowledgeable, and collaborative approach to care has been deeply affirming. If you are seeking a doctor who will take the time to exercise compassion, tailor their care to your needs, and collaborate with you to achieve your goals, Dr. Majeed is an exceptional choice.|Dr. Majeed is thorough in his evaluation, empathetic in his manner.  His treatments are successful, and he will not recommend therapies which are not necessary.  He has been very responsive to my concerns, and to those of my wife, who needed a cortisone injection for shoulder pain.  He is a doctor who we respect very much, both professionally and personally.|I had severe pain throughout my whole body and it felt like lightning was ripping my cells apart. None of my doctors knew what was going on and then after a month I found Dr. Majeed. He immediately knew what was going on with me, explained how to treat it, and told me he could give me hope which was very comforting as my anxiety and depression had skyrocketed due to the pain. The treatment plan he explained to me was 4 ketamine infusions. He gave a lot of information about the process and what to expect during the infusion and made himself very available for questions. Overall I had a great experience with him as my doctor and after the treatment he recommended the pain is completely gone.|I have seen Dr. Majeed for evaluation and treatment of lower back and hip pain on two occasions a few years apart (multiple visits on each occasion). In my experience, he is a knowledgeable and caring physician who is perceptive and who treats patients in the full context of their lives. He works closely with the physical therapists at Point Performance, who have been instrumental in helping me recover function and reduce pain (thank you Ally L!). He has prescribed medication when I have needed it but is not a pill-pusher and I feel fortunate to have him as my pain physician.|I went to Dr. Majeed with a very unusual pain complaint. He listened quietly and carefully to my history. He proposed a compound medication that other doctors had not considered.

They had me back on my feet within 24 hours.  The office was super clean and all of the office were professional and super nice.  I definitely will go there again in the future.|Easy to communicate with staff and office. David Rodriguez was my provider. He was very thorough, kind and professional. Thanks again!|The staff at Laurel are very friendly and kind.  They ask before they touch you as they want to make sure they are not causing you any additional pain.  The office is clean and tidy.  Amit Patel PA is kind and extremely competent.  He gives me more informatIon about pathology than my Dr.'s and I understand what he is saying. I really appreciate his kind compassionate and knowledgeable care. He has been a real blessing to me!|Due to an Insurance change, I had to find another pain management doctor. Which was fine, because my old one was always late by 1-2 hours on every appointment and so I ended up always wasting my time. Anyway, when having to switch doctors sometimes they want to reinvent the wheel.

I showed up with all of my notes. I included my medications I've been taking, the treatment plan I've had for years and anything else I thought was helpful. Dr. Alexander Bury was simply a fresh breath of air. I'm 44, been in pain for over 20 years from a roller coaster accident. He listened, appreciated my notes and info and provided a wealth of information on the pain device. He said let's not deviate from my regular plan. It's taken me years to have a plan that allows me to function with my kids and husband.

Definitely recommend this business especially this doctor. Thank you for your compassion!|My first appointment was today with Dr PATEL. I thought he was wonderful! Very nice and listened to all my health history. He said we're gonna get you where you need to be. And I felt like he was genuinely concerned about my overall health as a patient. The front desk receptionist was nice and everyone else was very nice too!!! I really like him. Wonderful Dr|The front desk and the nursing staff were courteous and polite. And the Physician Assistant Patel will definitely be an excellent doctor. He listened well and answered my questions professionally.|So the PA Amit Patel is a very kind and compassionate doctor and the office staff and MA are very good. Here are the problems:
1)I have been seen 3 times over almost 3 months with no treatment plan.
2)They can't seem to get the records from my other doctors in a timely manner.
3)You cannot call there office and actually talk to a human being.they have a call center that passes on a message I have left many messages with no return call .
4)They have a patient portal that the doctors don't respond to the messages you send
5)Their check in system that calls you never works so you can't check in unless your at a computer.
So my summary of the system they have is that they have great doctors and staff but they see you frequently without actually treating anything. The reviews of 5 stars are the only ones you will see because reviews like min never get addressed. There system keeps you from communicating with your doctor and doesn't allow the doctor time to address your real issues. This company makes a lot of visits and money but the patients are not receiving the good care. They are apathetic and make no effort to resolve problems as they occur in real time. I'm a nurse for 23years and have given my all to my patients. I have destroyed my body giving care to others, yet this group couldn't even call me back, doctor Patel you said you would let me know if you could get my records which is the only thing stopping me from getting treatment why didn't you care enough to call or email. Do better people don't expect perfection just compassionate caring attentiveness!
UPDATE 8/2/23
SO I increased my review of this pain managment office to 3 or 3.5.Dr Patel and Candice in the office are amazing they receive 10 stars. The doctor did finally get the information from my other doctors and he has made a plan that allows me to function like I used to while I strength my body, stretch and work on flexibility and mobility and balance. He has given me back my ability to move beyond my past comorbidities. He has treated me with respect and non judgement. I can now heal. It was a rocky start and we will see each other in Columbia as the laurel office is getting a facelift. I will say this I would recommend PA Amid Patel to anyone with chronic pain issues that is trying to get better and just needs to be treated like a human not a medical diagnosis.....He is very empathetic!!!!! The patient portal is the only real way to connect with your doctor should you need to the phone situation with this company is janky at best but it does allow the doctors to spend more time with the patients and less time in the phone.|I love my doctor. Dr Patel is always informative and meets all of needs. Gives great advice on my health issues. He's the best! Thank you for being a great person to talk to about anything!
