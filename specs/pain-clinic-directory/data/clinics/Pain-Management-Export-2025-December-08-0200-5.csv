Great service|I have been a patient of Dr. Craig Davis for many years.  My experience always has been a positive one because he cares about me and wants to help make my life better.  I have literally been given my life back through his procedures to help me with what has been excruciating pain over more than 12 years.  Because of his expertise and knowledge, I now can live a better and more fulfilling life.

I recommend Dr. Craig Davis to everyone I meet who struggles with back and joint pain because of my own personal experiences.  I give them 5 stars for excellence in every way!|Dr. Davis & his assistant are cordial & professional. Good at explaining procedures & options. Able to make an appointment within a week. My only regret was not taking a photo of Dr. D's colorful socks! Signage could be clearer outside the building - had to make a few loops around. (But then, I'm directionally impaired.) Reception wall very high - seeing tops of heads only, with the exception of one lower desk. Needs a little color in the all shades of gray interior. Overall, treated well and not feeling pain, which was the purpose of my visit!|They called me the day after I saw my primary doctor. They set up an appointment for next day. They sent me all the paper work to investigate about my health life. They saw me on my set up time. The NP was super nice. The doctor examed me quickly. He is a very nice man. They gave me the referral to physiotherapist.  They will see me in two weeks.|Very good experience.

I was taking a Med that when I first took it, it made me dizzy and throw up, so I had greatly reduced what I was taking. With him being thorough in talking with me, this was brought up and made me realize that this is the med that is to help with my leg issue.

They were so kind, didn't make me feel foolish at all for the mistake.

The nurses are simply the best! They are so sweet and caring, it's hard not to smile when I'm around them. Macally is incredibly nice and has always been flexible with me, whether I'm running late or need to reschedule an appointment. I truly appreciate their support and kindness! It's such a joyful experience to be there!|The choice to visit a clinic for chronic pain is obviously intensely personal. Pain clinics by their nature may have inherent tensions. Patients with chronic pain may also be dependent on certain medications. The clinic is required to provide the highest level of professional and ethical care, while under stringent rules of regulatory oversight.
The clinic (not just Dr. Partridge, but also his medical and administrative team) meets these objectives exactly. You will not be judged for medical or medicinal realities. You won't be assumed to be there for motives other than chronic pain. As they (the physician and staff) come to know you, they will assess on the basis of your medical needs the quality of your life. As they approach the task with integrity, they will expect the same from patients, resulting a personal relationship that exceeds and is a relief from many standard assembly line specialty clinics. They will certainly treat your physical pain, and treat the difficulty of being in pain as well.
The office's organization is superb, and processes procedures and prescriptions efficiently in a highly transparent manner.
In short, while current science may only be able to respond to part of your pain, this clinic applies the best of current science to heal as much of it as possible, and provides support and encouragement in the course of treatment.|If there was a way to give Dr. Devon Partridge, DO with the Interventional Spine and Pain Management clinic in Provo, Utah 10 Stars, I would. He is simply outstanding. I have been dealing with nerve pain due to a benign cervical tumor that was found and removed in early 2012. Unfortunately, it hasn't been an easy diagnosis to remedy the numerous resulting pain issues that I have dealt with over the past 12+ years. Dr. Partridge has been able to ""crack the code"" and identify some unique remedies where other pain specialists have failed.

In addition to his outstanding professionalism,  his entire staff is exceptional. A few of his staff members that I have recently worked with, McKenna, Sienna, and Emma,  reflect the kindness, patience,  empathy, and understanding that is a hallmark of their office.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism. The staff were incredibly attentive, and Dr. Measom provided exceptional care, taking the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly explain the treatment options available. The facility itself is modern, clean, and comfortable, creating a calming atmosphere. Thanks to their expertise and dedication, I have experienced significant relief from my chronic pain. I highly recommend Interventional Spine & Pain Management to anyone seeking compassionate and effective pain management solutions.|I don't typically leave reviews but over the past two years I have had only positive experiences with Dr. Measom and his staff.

My previous pain doctor never seemed to have the time of day and was often booked out for several months. Dr. Measom and his staff have been able to get me into the clinic much quicker.

Each visit I feel heard and my pain has been reduced significantly. I have dealt with chronic pain for the better half of a decade and Dr. Measom has suggested new procedures that haven't even been mentioned at other clinics. I'm confident he's up to date with the lastest treatments and they've seen to be very helpful for me.

Highly recommend these guys!|I have been a patient at Dr. Measom's clinic for some time now, and I am consistently impressed by the exceptional care provided by Tyson (MA) and Dr. Measom. Tyson is always friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, making me feel comfortable and well-cared for during my visits. Dr. Measom is a skilled and compassionate physician who takes the time to listen to my concerns and provides effective pain management solutions. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone seeking compassionate and effective pain management care.|I was a patient here for 15 years and NEVER broke the rules.  When the dose was not managing the pain they told me another doctor would be willing to increase it. One visit and the new Dr. said they were lying and had done the same to several others. I called Interventional Spine & Pain Management a dozen times to get an appointment and was told they would call me back. They never did. So I went in to the office to get one.  The staff then told me they were instructed to refuse me an appointment.
Money has been their only goal!
Avoid this place like the plague!!|I couldn't praise this office and their Drs and staff enough! I have suffered silently with chronic pain for years because my diagnosis is a little different than their everyday stuff. I tried another place previously and felt unheard and stuck between a rock and a hard place when it came to my medication and care so I decided to switch and from day one I felt heard, I felt like they genuinely CARED. Dr Measom is one of the most knowledgeable people I've met and his staff are so incredible! The receptionist has always called back immediately if she hasn't answered the first time, she answers any questions or concerns I have anytime I call and if she doesn't have the answer she gets in touch with who she needs to and they take care of it as soon as they can! Amy has personally called to resolve an issue the same exact day even when she was in a different location than when I even seen her. The MA is INCREDIBLE and their whole staff is knowledgeable I just can't say enough good about a staff who generally cares about people suffering everyday! Their procedure side is just as amazing and their MAs helped me when I was a wreck for my first injection not knowing what to expect they handled it so professionally and compassionately. Thank you so much to the providence office for not making others feel weak or unheard for their chronic pain. You guys rock!!|I am hands down one of the most critical people you will ever meet. Particularly when I am paying for healthcare. Dr. Garg is a good Dr. But this review is to highlight the staff more than anything. I have never had to wait for a room. I have never waited to be seen more than 5 minutes or so after i have been taken back and my appointments have been at all hours of the day mornings to afternoons. The PA here is phenomenal she listens and answers all of my questions in detail without rushing through my appointments. Their office has hands down the best MA i have ever dealt with she is very sincere, accurate, and helpful. The receptionist is great as well. Dr. Garg is VERY fortunate to have the staff he has now. They have all played a big role in improving my quality of life considering how bad my back injury is.|Dr. Garg and his staff are amazing! They are so friendly, knowledgeable and very professional!|The doctor was great. As a veteren I was really excited. He seemed to know more than most doctors. His office supposidely sent the va my prescription which was never recieved. I talked to the front desk and they seem unwilling to do what is required to connect with the va and get my prescription authorized. Ive been waiting weeks and am very dissapointed in his staff.

I was under April's care afterwards and it was terrible. Maybe it was my younger age, but she treated me like I was a liar and just trying to get pills so I could ""get high and lay in bed all day"" (HER words). I was really just trying to be able to function and sleep at night - the pills she did give me helped very much, but I never got to the point that I could actually sleep, and she acted like tolerance wasn't a thing. Holding down a job and studying high level math seems impossible to me when you're up almost all night every night and daydreaming about suicide.

The previous two recognized my pain and tried giving me whatever those shots are that help immediately. April was condescending, rude, and overall made getting relief so stressful that it made my pain worse.

It had been over 3 years so I didn't even remember going to their offices/buildings. I got a poorly typed letter that looked so unauthentic and bland,  I thought it was fake and a scam for sure, until I went to the address in the letter. Letter states I owed nearly 950 dollars, but when I went to the office, I was told there is a cash incentive of 400 dollars to pay what I supposedly owed.  I contacted my insurance and my insurance gave me a claim number and updated billing address. I again went to the address of the letter and gave them a printed copy of my insurance information and claim number with instructions on how to to bill my insurance with the updated address.  Intermountain Pain and Injury never contacted me again and 1 month later I was sent to collections.  I'll add a picture of the actual letter-- what a joke.|It's been 8 months since my car accident, and I have seen over 10 different doctor's for my injury. Dr. Edson was by far the best yet! He took the time to ask questions and dug below the surface, he really wanted to help me. I love that he asked the questions, did an exam and came up with what he thought was going on, THEN read my MRI results & previous treatment. He spent a long time going over everything, and is determined to keep me out of surgery.  I got some trigger point injections & although it was painful, they were the least painful injections I have yet to have. Very tender handed & fantastic bedside manner. This doctor has a heart and truly cares about every person he sees. I'm so glad to have found him!|This place is amazing. Dr Edison and the nurse Allison are extremely kind, very compassionate and you know that they truly want to help you. I never imagined having to go to a place like this but not by my choice I was in a bad car accident and I needed help. I'm very thankful to Dr Edison for his kindness and for everyone at Intermountain pain and injury. If you go here you truly won't regret it.|Worst place ever, do not go to them.. went in to have some mri sent out and instead got sent to another place just to be seen by them..Dr's excuse was I was in so much pain he couldn't properly do his exam. If that's the case wouldn't you want to get your clients in quick as possible not bounce them around everywhere? They lied about everything they would do for me basically just looked at me and sent me on my way with the impression I would be in contact with someone to schedule my mri's. They are liars and not looking to help people .|I have been to this clinic a few times.. I had one appointment i literally had to wait in the hall for 15 minutes until the doctor and staff came back from lunch... They acted like it was no big deal to just keep me and another patient waiting until they felt like coming back. I also don't feel like the doctor really listens to my problem. He just keeps giving me the same injection that helps for 2-3 days and that's after 2-3 days of being in excruciating pain from the injections. Not really worth my time if they don't really help me. On my last appointment i waited for and hour past when my appointment was to even get taken back to a room. They only had one other patient other than me.. I would not recommend!|So disappointed here... Twice received temporary nerve blocking injections in hopes of getting a long term solution, which I was told would be done once the temporary injections were complete because that is what insurance required. Had an appointment scheduled, after calling insurance on my own the day before, that the claim had never even been submitted. Now I am being told that his procedure is ""elective"" and that the doctor knew this all along (which is why he told me he had a plan B lined up from day 1). Have been going in circles with them from almost 2 months and now am being told I need to find another doctor to perform the procedure and that will be my responsibility to do so. So, a complete waste of time and money.|After having a car accident I was sent here. I gained a lot of weight due to not being able to move and work out. These doctors knowing I needed surgery drained what they could of the lawsuit. I was told to try a procedure and the first three were free. I was billed 200.00 for it! Never did the other two thank goodness. I became depressed with the pain and weight gain, but instead of compassion I was told to do the ""push away"" push away from the table...I have worked in the medical field a long time. This was rude and I did not find it funny. I was muscle and fit when I was in the car accident. My life was turned up side down. To say some thing like this hurt so bad. I did report this as I feel my attorney should be sending clients to a professional doctor. Side note, if they do an injection make sure the doctor is not side tracked and on the phone. First injection that I was not able to stand and walk away from!! Glad experience is over!!!|I was so grateful for the referal to Intermountain Pain after my car accident. My first appointment with David covered all the areas of my wellness. Because of the in-depth questions, a plan for my wellness was made.

My procedure went very well and he was even understanding about my anxiety and never pushed or rushed me. I can't say enough about how great my experience with this doctor and his team has been.|I changed pain management clinic this last month because my previous pain management office absolutely failed me. Phusion wellness is a pill mill. They contradict themselves. Constantly. They really didn't care about anything, just money. Anyhow, I won't go on about them, but wow what a difference. I saw Shane, the PA. I feel so cared for. He has a plan on how to address my pain. Dr. Chen did come in and introduced himself. It was such a nice feeling. I felt safe. Shane is just amazing. I haven't had someone address my pain like that since I moved here from California 9 years ago. It felt legit. Safe. Clean. I feel like my quality of life may improve tremendously. We have a plan. WE have a plan. I don't know why it took this long to find them. Wait, I know why!! Phusion dominates google. They pay to be all over the first page of google. Freaking pill mill.

All the Dr.'s in this practice have shown nothing but respect and genuine concern for both my mental and physical health.

Highly recommend Alta and all that practice within.|Dr.Chen has made me see that it is possible to feel good again. The experience I get when going to Alta Pain Physicians is by far outstanding.

He takes time to listen and asks questions to accurately diagnose your pain.  He clearly explains the procedures that needs to be performed.  I have had 98% pain relief since going to him.

Works with you, helps in anyway to determine the plan of care best suited to your health needs. I recommend him and his staff highly as a retired RN.

I truly appreciate being under his care and the effort he puts into me.|Dr. Coles was wonderful -- he's compassionate, understanding, and took the time to listen.

I'm glad I found him and I have hope that he'll be able to help me while I face my never ending challenges with breast cancer. /audrey|Go here if you want to pay for weekly visits and experience discrimination/be treated as an addict.

The doctor has been forcing weekly visits for more than a year. Then, finally moved to biweekly appointments. Guess what? Canceled an appointment the day before and they used this as their justification to move back to weekly appointments. They lied and said it was a no call no show even though the appointment was canceled the day before. One of the assistants did call the day before and hung up right away. A phone call was made back to them immediately and they answered. I'm not sure if it's intentional or the assistants are incompetent but I do believe it's their incompetency. They also sent prescriptions to the wrong pharmacy after confirming the right one and continue to gouge off of weekly appointments.

Then, during the appointments they imply that the patient could snort certain drugs and that's why they recommend moving drugs when you ask to go to biweekly appointments. Why would someone move to a less effective drug they know doesn't work for them? Especially when they are on one that currently works. FYI the doctor was told this drug doesn't work because we have been on it in the past. This clinic does not listen to their patients and judges their patients heavily. I'm not sure if this is based on race or other factors but it is disturbing nonetheless. My friend who is white use to attend this clinic and was treated far better. They were prescribed two opioids at once. When asked if this was an option the doctor denied it and said it is not an option at all.

Conclusion: The weekly appointments are too expensive. If the service was non-discriminatory and more compassionate then maybe it would be worth it. However, they do not base their pain management recommendations on pain management therapy at all. Instead, they base their recommendations on what will keep the patient coming in weekly and what is least effective. There are other pain management clinics/doctors that offer monthly appointments without discrimination. Please save yourself time, money, and dignity and visit another clinic.|Very understanding and assured me that he and his team could get my pain in check. Great experience and I really felt that Dr. Coles cares and listened to me.

Told me I need to workout. And said ""if you look hard enough you can find someone to dope you up"". I don't want narcs. I want to get better. I had two spine surgeries last year, one of which failed. Shame on this doctor. I waited two months to get into this place. My doctor said they could help me get better. I'm out of options now to manage my pain. I cannot express how uncomfortable the doctor made me feel and how absolutely devastated and depressed I am now. I don't know how much longer I can handle this pain in my spine.|Reading other people's one star reviews I understand that I am not alone. Trying to contact Interventional Spine and Pain Management is a joke. They never answer my calls, and don't get back to my messages I leave on their voice machine. I was referred to this office and went to my appointment weeks ago. The front desk lady was rushing me even though there was no one else in the waiting room. The doctor that helped me didn't want to spend the time to get to know what I needed. The doctor was supposed to send the prescription I need to my pharmacy. It was never sent and I've been trying to contact this office for awhile because I do not live close by and don't have the time to drive out of my way to ask them to send my prescription when it should have been done in the first place and could have been easily solved if they bothered to pick up the phone.|Staff is nice enough. However, I called just after 9AM Monday morning when I was in extreme pain with difficulty walking, didn't get a call back till the next day, and told me to call back .  They never answer the calls, always going to voicemail.   On my first visit  there, I showed up in extreme pain to the point of being barely able to walk and sweating profusely from pain and told to come in the next week.  This place has no consideration of someone's discomfort and would not stay open one minute after closing hours to help someone in great pain . Dr. Nelson needs to train his staff for more considerate staff practices.  I would avoid this business!|Dr Nelson and his staff are amazing! Very professional and prompt! His front desk was very helpful in getting me scheduled quickly. I've had low back pain for years and Dr Nelson helped come up with a treatment plan that best suited me and best part is it's working great. Highly recommend!|Dr Nelson & his staff have been amazing to work with. In 2017 I was in a car wreck and him and his team did multiple epidural injections in my lower back (herniated/bulged disks) to try and prevent surgery. Unfortunately those injections only helped a little bit but did not work all that well and I had a discectomy done that took away some pain but I had to get a different job that was more of a desk type job.

In 2020 the pain came back and was causing issues with daily life and work. I was put on muscle relaxers and painkillers to help with the pain and spasms in my low back and legs along with some neuropathy in my left leg/foot.

In 2022 I started working at a more physically demanding job and the pain, spasms & neuropathy started to get even worse. That doctor's office referred me back to Dr Nelson to explore my options in regards to injections, ablations etc and to see if surgery was needed once again.

This has been a long process of having multiple different kinds of injections that tend to have only helped for a very short amount of time. His office and staff work their magic and got me into a neurological surgeon to go over all of my MRI information and see if another surgery was needed. Being 34 years old that doctor did not want to do a fusion because once you get one the stats show your going to have more every 5 to 10 years.

With all that being said Dr Nelson suggested a spinal cord stimulator and I just got done with the 7-Day trial. During that trial the first two days I was pretty sore however the last 5 days were the best 5 days in regards to the chronic pain that I've had in years! I was finally able to sleep more than 4 hours at night. I definitely did not want this trial to end because now I have to wait for insurance to approve the real one to be installed.

So many people think that this process can be fixed very quickly and that does happen for a very small amount of people however for the most of us it is a long process of elimination and Dr Nelson and his team have been very helpful through this journey of getting out of chronic pain and lowering/potentially getting off of my opioid medication.

Dr Nelson, thank you and your team!! I am so looking forward to the operation day of that spinal cord stimulator!!|Dr. Alex Nelson is to me and my husband a miracle worker! I had horrible nerve pain in my ribs for almost 3 years. When we met with him, he said a spinal cord stimulator would help me the most. He was correct! I had my stimulator placed on June 6th of this year and now my pain levels are in the 2-4 range rather than the 7-9 range they had been. We absolutely recommend Dr. Nelson to anyone who is having nerve pain.|This place is a joke.. I contacted them to make arrangements to see if they would be a good fit for me. I gave them all of my information going back to 2017 my social security number all my past Doctors information everything. I was told I would be contacted with a few days to a week. 4 weeks go by with no update or follow up call/email. I contacted them today to find out why they would not accept me for a initial appointment m
Let alone as a patent? After speaking to ShyLicia I was informed that things have been pretty crazy there with everyone going on summer vacation & pretty much I fell through the cracks. & I was informed that they had sent my (File?) to another company that they felty would be a better fit for me. All of this without notifying me. I also found out that this place
(((.  Interventional Spine & Pain Management - Ogden. ))) They are not even a pain management clinic??? They do steroid shots in your back and that is it. The way I see it this place leads people to think they are one thing when indeed they are absolutely not. I give my experience with this Pop Up Stand ZERO STARS! there is no excuse for deceiving people or wasting there time. I would not have ever contacted this place or given them any of my information had I know they were in fact NOT a pain management clinic like they claim to be. On top of that if you are bought in by there false name do not be surprised if you never hear back from them. Cause you will not get a call or email from them letting you know why they are not accepting you as a patient or to ask you if its ok if they send your name and number to another completely different company.  If you are looking for a dependable reliable pain management Doctor keep looking cause this place is definitely not that.|I am writing this review regarding the highly unsatisfactory experience I endured at Dr. Nelson's medical practice. The series of incidents, ranging from initial appointment scheduling to the handling of my appointments, reflects a profound lack of professionalism and patient care.

Following Dr. Nelson's recommendation, I underwent various medical studies, including blood tests, X-rays, and an MRI. Unfortunately, despite these extensive tests, no diagnosis was provided, necessitating my intervention to obtain my medical file from my general doctor.

The first red flag emerged during my attempt to schedule an appointment by phone. Multiple voicemails were left unanswered, prompting an in-person visit. The receptionist's tardiness and subsequent misplacement of my information showcased a concerning lack of organizational efficiency and communication.

The culmination of these issues transpired during my second appointment. Despite receiving a confirmation for a 12:30 pm slot, my husband and I arrived at 12:28 pm to find the office locked. Despite our attempts to seek clarification, the staff chose to ignore us and even turned off the lights. This behavior was both unprofessional and unacceptable.

Contacting the neighboring office revealed that blame was placed on a new staff member. However, my appointment was confirmed days before by an older staff member, and the inexcusable treatment persisted even after providing evidence of the scheduled time.

Subsequent interactions with Dr. Nelson's receptionist were marked by extreme rudeness and a lack of accountability. The threatening and mocking tone, combined with an attempt to deflect responsibility, intensified my dissatisfaction.

Following a formal complaint, the manager, Sarah, issued a superficial apology, attributing the lapse to a new staff member. Additionally, she issued a warning regarding my conduct towards her staff, without addressing the core issues raised.",2025-01-22|2024-10-14|2024-11-13|2024-09-04|2024-05-16|2024-06-20|2024-05-28|2024-01-25,1|1|1|5|5|5|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|1 p.m.|11 a.m.",54.8|54.6|52.6,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJH_wIA54PU4cRxk0Qz8PlrT0,35

I had been struggling with chronic back pain for years, and after trying multiple treatments with little success, I finally found relief here. From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel welcome and cared for. The team of professionals is incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and dedicated to finding the right treatment plan for each individual.

The personalized approach made all the difference. They took the time to understand my pain and tailored a treatment that worked wonders. After just a few sessions, I noticed a significant improvement, and now, I feel like I have my life back! The facility is clean, well-equipped, and has a relaxing atmosphere that makes every visit a positive experience.

If you're struggling with back pain, I highly recommend [Clinic Name]. Their expertise, compassion, and effective treatments are truly top-notch!|Spinal Interventions is awesome. They are well organized, quick to get you in and the staff knows what they're doing. I've only gone to Dr. Stringham and he's the best. He explains everything he's going to do and answers all your questions. I haven't had any procedures done by any of the other doctors but I'm sure they're good. I highly recommend them.|After a year of being in so much pain after a wicked car wreck, and my doctor unable and unwilling to help me get any relief, I had lost hope.  I met with Dr Clint Olsen and he knew exactly what to do and helped me manage my chronic pain.

On my second appointment, I literally gave him a big hug. He asked what we were doing? With tears in my eyes, I told him that he dramatically changed the quality of my life.

We've worked together for over 2 years now and it's been slow but it's been progress! Dr Donaldson has been a huge help as well. She has given me Epidural cervical and lumbar spine injections every few months, which has helped me to be able to reduce the opioid usage as I continue to fight to get my life and lifestyle back.

It's been wonderful to have a solid team that has supported me through this incredibly difficult challenge. It's so nice to have hope and be optimistic about my future. Thank You Spinal Interventions for helping me manage my pain and medications. Thank you Clint and thank you Ashley!

Sincerely,
Rick|Dr. Stringham is one of the best healthcare providers I have ever had the privilege of working with. He is empathetic, caring, and has excellent listening skills. He shows a great understanding of a ever changing landscape of clinical care and new technology. I have a many back produces by Dr Stringham.  He has excellent hands and takes great care to make sure I am comfortable and well prepared for the process ahead. I would highly recommend Dr. Stringham to anyone who is seeking a pain management physician.|Dr stringham and his staff are the most amazing kind and intelligent professionals ever. They have gave me back my quality of life and able to live a pain free life doing things I love to do . Thank you much|Normally I get good results from the treatments at SI.  There has been a difference this time.  It has been 7 days since my visit.  I have experienced greater pain than I had before the visit.  Possibly a nerve was hit.  I do not know.  I will call them when the Christmas break ends.  They are good people.  I am sure they will assist me.|I was seen a few months ago, so maybe things are different. I saw someone who listened to what I had to say in about ten minutes, went out to the doctor, told her what I said in a minute or two, and then they both came back and the doctor told me some options. It was like playing telephone.
After I had a scan done, the receptionist called me to tell me that I needed surgery. I had questions, but instead of talking to someone who had an education about the issue, I didn't get any information. I could have made another appointment, but was hesitant to go in and have another game of telephone, especially since they gave me zero other options over the phone besides a surgery. Luckily I had a second opinion that went into more detail (and I only talked to one doctor!) and did not get the surgery that likely would not have fixed the problem.
Perhaps a messaging system to ask the doctor questions would be helpful. Or a medical assistant who can ask the doctor relevant questions after. I don't want to talk to a receptionist about my questions. Maybe the doctors also need to look into more options besides automatically going for surgery.|Dr. Donaldson, her nurse, and the MA's are all top notch!!  They made me feel very comfortable, they did a great job at explaining every step of the process and medical procedure I had done. The Doc. is amazing, she did an amazing job, her tableside manor was impeccable. She made me feel feel welcomed yet she is also very professional.

Dani and Jeanne are very helpful and friendly. Roger has been so great in helping me with my pain and getting me back to health. I am so grateful for this center and their goals to help their patients. I love their complete approach. They include you in the process. I love that I am able to give feedback. I love that psychology, physical therapy, and doctors are involved. This is seriously a great clinic to go to!|**Update** I have continued to see Adam at UVPM. The office staff has been great, there haven't been anymore billing concerns, and things have gone smoothly. I can honestly say I would recommend them to a friend now.

At first, I had a hard time getting used to the level of scrutiny and incredulity with which they treat most of their patients. I definitely felt I was treated like someone just convicted of a drug offense. However, after 2.5 years, I feel I've built a pretty good relationship with my PA Adam, and would recommend him. Because of him, I've continued to commute to Orem, despite living about an hour away.

However, 6 of my last 8 appointments have been disappointing to me. They've messed something up, and it seems every time I try to give them another chance, something else happens that makes me irritated again. It seems they mess up more than they get right.

Over the last 2.5 years, I have had a lot of problems with their billing. It seems every month is another issue. They have lost multiple payments of mine, tried to increase my co-pay, tried to charge for no-show appointments that they mention 10 months later (this has happened twice at least) and after you pay anything, it seems you have to remind them of it next time you go in. ALWAYS get your receipt, and I'd recommend keeping them in your car to show them.

It's not just their billing though, there are issues in other aspects too. There have been missed appointments, rude receptionists, lost requests for procedures, and other things. This week I went in for my monthly visit and there was debate as to what pain med they'd prescribe me. After deciding they wanted to confer with another doctor first, I was told they'd call in the prescription when they decided, so I left the office. When they called, they told me that they couldn't actually call in a prescription to a pharmacy like most doctors, so I would need to come pick it up. When I told them I live in Salt Lake, and work in Davis County till late most days, they offered to mail it for only $7.

It isn't the incident this week that has made them lose my business, it's the combination of everything from the last 2.5 years, and especially all the headache from the last 6 months. I'd recommend people go to other pain clinics though or continue to see their specialist.|This place is amazing! The staff are so great, and the doctors are even moreso. I never feel like just a number being pushed through appointments- they really care, which yes means they enforce their guidelines but they truly help manage your pain. Adam Wright is one of the best physicians I've ever had.|I've only been going here for about 3 months but I am so impressed!! They are understanding and the entire staff is so nice. Rob Harkness is an amazing guy. He has always treated me with respect and never belittle me or made me feel stupid or like I shouldn't be in pain. Dr. Ockey and Dr. Dana are amazing physicians and they really understand chronic pain more than the other clinic I went to years back called Nexus. They treat you like a real person here. Definitely would recommend if you have any type of pain. I have a super rare condition and they even understand it and have always been so nice and knowledgeable.|I have worked with a couple different pain management clinics and other providers and no one has worked as hard as Doctor Norma Bowers has for me. He was honestly the first Doctor to actually listen to what I was going through and worked to help me get better, he treated me like a human being. Not just another patient paying his Bill's. He treats everyone he talks to with respect. I have nothing but respect for him and his staff and would recommend him to anyone struggling with pain. It's nice to be a normal human being again.|I've been going to UVPM for 4 months, so I'm just starting to get to know them. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic back pain. I do feel very scrutinized regarding legitimate medication use, but I also understand that they have to cover their bases legally. The medical professionals I've worked with there are nice but do seem to think their office knows all and that other doctors you might have seen don't have the expertise or knowledge to help you. The reception staff, excluding one very nice woman who I wish was the only one I ever had to deal with, is a joke. I've been quoted different co-pay costs several times, and it once took 2 weeks to get a message to my doctor and a refill printed off. Two weeks, and it wasn't even a new prescription, just a problem with insurance that required them to call my pharmacy. Such a nightmare.

I also don't appreciate having to wait so long to see my doctor at each appointment, as I've had to do a few times. I definitely feel that sense of being judged when it comes to medications, and I kind of wish they could walk in my shoes for just one day. Sure, they're experts in pain, but if you haven't actually experienced it, you can't truly understand.

All things considered, I'd give the office as a whole 3/5 stars.|Why two stars. They are a standard pain clinic. What they offer you can get just about any where, they are literally nothing special and people who think that they are great most likely have not had many other places for comparison. As far as pain management they are fine. However what they lack is really caring about their patients. The first visit we went and they reviewed our case ( my wife was the patient ) and did not listen to us as far as what we suggested, instead they had their own suggestions, which is fine I am coming to a doctor to get advice, regardless we tried their suggested procedure knowing that it had a small likelihood for success.

It did not help ( no surprise but we figured this would clear the air for an actual conversation ) We went back for our follow up visit expecting to have real conversation about our options at that point in time. Instead we have a Physicians assistant who said, oh that did not help, well lets get you into biofeedback and psychological counseling.

This is simply stupid, my wife has had this issue for years and if either of those two options would have helped we would not be coming to the pain clinic in the first place, in the second place I wanted to TALK to the doctor about real options moving forward in treatment. The PA was combative, as though the suggestion that there may be additional forms of treatment was impossible but they would review records from other doctors ( they can't simply accept what we are telling them we did they have to have the actual notes from other doctors in order to even consider additional treatment options. ) Fine, we make another appointment, call the myriad of other doctors to send in documents to them, simply to have another appointment to TALK about what we wanted to do when we originally came in the first place.

Then the day of the appointment we hit traffic on the way down. We call to let them know we are going to be 15 minutes. It took me an hour to leave work, pick up my wife, and get to their location, and they cancel the appointment.

In summary, they did not listen, wasted our time, money and everything else with the first three appointments, and then finally on the fourth decided we were wasting too much of their time and cancelled on us.

I do not recommend this pain clinic. They can manage pain just fine and if you do not have other choices I say go to them, but I think you will find them disingenuous and myopic in thought processes. Bad Experience. I give them two stars because in fairness they are a pain clinic and they will manage your pain.|This business has the absolute WORST customer service I have ever experienced!  We have experienced multiple delays in service due to a lack of decent in-house communication.  On MULTIPLE occasions,  orders for physical therapy or MRIs have been lost in their system and never sent.  The situation never rectifies itself until an appointment is made to go in, and then we get profuse apologies, but still get less than par service.  I DO NOT recommend this company as a source of pain management or as a source of decent customer service.  In the 4 months we have attended their office, my husband has not received any sort of pain management assistance. Part time employees who can't even remember who you are or what your situation is until you have wasted an extra 30 minutes re-telling the story every visit.",2015-03-06|2015-04-16|2019-03-15|2016-12-06|2018-08-01|2015-06-12|2016-09-28|2017-11-30,5|4|5|5|5|3|2|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJT6CxFC-FTYcRViLELSNrFCs,86

His staff is also amazing Sarah put me at ease with the procedure and Tyler and Beth also were great.  If i could give more stars i would. If you're having any back pain,neck pain or any chronic pain this is the location to help you.|I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Andrew Talbott at Southwest Spine and Pain.  From the moment I walk in until I leave I am treated with kindness and enthusiasm by each person from the receptionist to the MA to the nurse to the Dr. Dr Talbott cares genuinely and has an amazing bedside manner. He is very knowledgeable about my pain and I know I am in good hands in my treatment whether it's the medication or the procedures. He performs them expertly and with precision. The vibe in the clinic is really good. Everyone smiles. The patients in the waiting room are always in a good  mood because of the vibe fostered and they know that Dr Talbott is the reason for their visit. I'm so grateful for the pain relief I have had for the last 4 years from him.|I had a very easy experience. I was thankful that the Dr took extra care to look at a recent MRI. No one else will look at it for 3 weeks. He was able to reach a spot that seems to help with my extreme pain. I think the procedure was 15 minutes and I was able to walk out right away. It's day one, no pain. Incredible.|Dr Talbot is the most caring  Dr I have ever come across ,break every bone in yur body from a industrial accident 3 stories up and a slip and fall to earth landing on cocrete,thank God we have a  Dr out there that can inject the right spot,block the most outrageous pain that a man can have ,and perscribe  the right medicines you can carry on on life. Thank you to all the great people at Southwest Spine and Pain Clinic, for all the loving care and compassion.|I played professional hockey, so I have extreme pain in my back. I know Dr Talbot is overwhelmed with patients. But there is one person in his office that is a miracle worker. That person is Malia. Whenever I have an issue, Malia solves the problem. She is the best employee that Dr Talbot has and I problably would have left for another DR if it wasn't for Malia!!!!!|While the PA's and Doctors in the practice are fabulous, the business practices of the ownership has gone downhill since I've been a patient.

They will now force you to pay for office visits even if your insurance doesn't require prior authorization. They are also now forcing office visits or virtual visits for medication renewals that are also just a money grab with no medical necessity for the visit itself.

Great example of what happens when medical practices are managed by accountants and the money grab process is put into effect. Buyer beware with these folks. I'll be looking around for alternatives.|This was my second visit and was not as good S my first. My appt was at 1:50 and I didn't get called back until 2:05 and then waited in the room until 2:25 saw Dr Talbot for like 5 minutes. The nurse that helped was not friendly at all. Not real happy with this visit.

Then I find out today they lied to my regular dr. Said I was 30 min late!! That I didn't want to do the p. Test!!! I did!! You guys are terrible!!! Im so glad it didn't work out !! Because they expect you to be there in 24 hrs anytime they want to count your pills even if you live an hour away!! That's what I was not willing to do . We are busy and cant be at their back and call. A friend of my husband's used to go there and said I dodged a bullet. Very rude staff high school mean girl style. And they lied to my dr??!!! I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. If I could give no stars I would!!!|Staff is friendly. Doctor are Great! Waiting room is nice and clean. Exam and treatment rooms are clean.|I guess my review is more a the office staff since I didn't even get to see a doctor. I Thought I had everything set up for  my appointment- which I waited over 6 weeks for. I had an appointment scheduled for a Monday. I got online to fill out the new patient paperwork the Saturday before and their system wouldn't let me do it. I went 15 minutes early thinking I could do the paperwork then but the receptionist told me that wasn't enough time and I'd need to reschedule. Turns out they entered my date of birth wrong in my chart. They acknowledged it was their mistake but still refused to see me. The next appointment is another 6 weeks out! That's not acceptable when I'm in pain and the mistake was their fault. I can't believe they are a pain clinic and have zero compassion for people in pain.|This office is the best I've been to. The staff is friendly. The doctor and the PA are very much in tuned with how you feel And concerned about what you're going through. They go above and beyond with pain management with injections and meds. I highly recommend this place. There is no better place.|This clinic is hands down the best pain management clinic I have been able to find.
From the moment you walk into the nice clean facility, you are greeted by a wonderful staff. They are polite, and make you feel like they care.
Dr. Baca is very skilled and knows what she is doing! She has done an amazing job working with me to build a recovery plan. Every procedure has been masterfully done.
It's a great change from going to places where they don't care to help you other than give you medicine and send you on your way.
I would highly recommend this clinic to anyone that wants to beat their pain.|This is an amazing clinic, and Dr. Baca is an amazing doctor. She's spent allot of time with me during my initial visit. She asked allot of of questions and explained, in detail, the causes of my pain. I also had an injection done in my hip..... And she was awesome!! The staff is also very nice. The clinic is beautiful and they have all the equipment needed for most pain relief procedures. I would highly recommend Glacier Peak....

The office staff and billing people just are so awful. Accusing me of lying. I made an appointment spoke to billing and receptionist they took my copay and made an appointment for 9:30. I arrived at 9:25 today for my appointment.
They tell me I don't have an appointment and I needed to pay more. I had clarified the payment and appointment twice with office staff tomorrow for today.
They were rude and have no COMPASSION!!!

I love my doctor or I would change doctors.

Sad day.|I consider Doctor Rajiv one of my Angels..
Suffering from pain is something so scary and even frightening... To know that he's there available every time I'm in pain it's so comforting.. He is so mindful and emphatic..
I couldn't be more luckier.. Thanks Doctor Rajiv for taking care for me for the last 10 years.. I remember the first time I was so desperate.. And he took care of me right away.. So professional and full of humanity.
Best doctor ever.|Excellent service. I no longer live in constant fear of pain. Support staff are polite and efficient. You must pay a $25 fee if you miss an appointment, so you can't reschedule until you've paid it. They have some flexibility, but it leaves an impression that profit comes first. They are firm in refusing to recommend marijuana as possibly helpful, which is disappointing. Exam rooms are stark white with black chairs---not at all calming or inviting. Some personal info is given in a way where anyone can hear, so some privacy is violated.

Dr Benfield is the most caring doctor I have had in my entire life. I will be 80 July 13 and he has kept me feeling so much better being a pain specialist so I can ride my bike.

He is amazing and cares so much about me as a human being and wanting to do all the physical things that I love to do. I especially love to hike steep hills and he makes it possible for me to do that without paying in the back. I also love to paddleboard and that can be hard on the back, but it isn't with the help that he gives me. Again, a fantastic doctor.

Yesterday I had the nerves in 3, 4  and 5 of the lumbar burnt.  Dr Benfield is so thorough and makes sure it is done the best possible to take away the pain in the lower back. He is amazing and makes the procedure not so uncomfortable with great conversation and I know he cares. He is the best doctor I believe I have ever been to that cares as much as he does. Today it feels great already. I don't even think I will have to wait for two weeks like it sometimes can. He is so knowledgeable and keeps up with the latest and best for all of us patients.

I have had horrible headaches for most of my life at least since age 30 and now I'm 80! Dr Benfield suggested an MRI on the neck and we did a block and it is amazing.

Always double checks my medications. And offers different suggestions to handle a problem|Update: Waited over 25 minutes past my appointment to see the provider today. Southwest gave a generic response to the review and took no accountability.

I've been a patient at Southwest Spine and Pain for over four years and have generally had a very positive experience.

Today, I had a 9:50 AM appointment. I called ahead to let them know I was running late and was informed that I had a 10-minute grace period, so it was no problem. However, when I arrived at 10:02 AM, just as I was walking up the steps, I received a text saying my appointment had been canceled by the provider.

I've often had to wait for extended periods to see providers, yet today I couldn't even be given the courtesy of an additional two minutes.

Positives:
Their billing personnel, especially Karen in the St. George location has gone above and beyond to help me fight my insurance. She is truly a patient advocate!
Multiple locations with providers working at various sites make scheduling convenient.
A wide range of treatment plans are available, and the ones they create are highly effective.
The clinics are always clean, and about 75% of the staff are incredibly kind and friendly.
Every medical assistant I've interacted with has been exceptional.

Negatives:
Doctors and staff are frequently running behind, though this is common in most medical offices.
Due to the volume of patients and locations, there are delays in medication refills.
I've received inconsistent information from different providers at times.

Update: saw a new provider after having to reschedule. Provider asked questions that would have been well answered in my chart. Addressed problems I had been having and was told to use more ice, heat and stretching.|I love Britney Hemingway and her team! Best doctor I've ever had|Been a patient with Southwest for several years now. I've seen a few of the Nurse Practitioners and Dr Freeman. They treat me so well.

Thank you all.  Dr. Urie is in Layton Utah.|Staff was kind, but Dr. Urie was rude and judgmental. I am a recovering addict that was self medicating for a 42% crooked angle in my lumbar spine. I chose to get clean and go to the Dr and get surgery to fix my back rather than self medicating with fentanyl and my spine is still not feeling better. He immediately started judging me and acting like my surgeon is just washing his hands of me! I left his office bawling because of the things he said to me. I had major back surgery 3 months ago and he told me my pain was fake and I just have a substance abuse issue! I have done substance abuse treatment in the past and if it's just a substance abuse issue, why would I choose to get clean and do it the right way to get my back fixed?! Sure made me feel hopeless when I left his office. Weird thing is he was still willing to treat me... what a jerk.|My wife was referred to this doctor for pain management. He told her he could fix her, did a whole bunch of different types of treatments on her! Epidurals and recommended physical therapy. This doctor is a scam and horrible!! We went somewhere else to get MRIs done and found out my wife has a bulged disc in her lower back and other issues in her upper back. Well we showed him the results just to see what he would say without telling him the results. He told my wife there was nothing wrong with her back that all she had was ""tense muscles ""  needless to say we WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HIM or recommend him to ANYONE!!!|Dr. Urie and his staff are excellent. He listened to my concerns and created a plan for healing and relief. I truly felt listened to and cared for while I was discussing my pain issues. The professionalism and patient care are amazing!|I have been having alot of different medical issues for many years now and have seen and received referrals to more than a dozen doctors and specialists. All of them have diagnosed me with many different illnesses and ailments including blood cancer which i began getting treatments for and did for 6 weeks until they decided i DID NOT have leukemia. I have been living with severe pain in my whole body for the past 5 years and have had numerous surgeries to replace several of my deteriorating joints. I was tired of all of the surgeries and misdiagnosis's and just wanted someone to tell me what is truly wrong with me. I came across Dr. Bradley Urie while looking for specialists in my area and made an appointment with him. First of all i was able to to get in very quickly and im so glad i did because he was the VERY 1ST doctor to actually listen to everything i had to say he asked me all the questions regarding my health that all the others did not and he is truly a godsend. He did a bunch of testing on my 1st appointment and at my 2nd appointment he had all the answers and a true diagnosis for me. Since i began seeing him he has been able to get my severe pain under control and has given me back some real quality of life. He has been truly amazing and his whole office staff are the sweetest and most helpful people you will ever meet. He is by far the best doctor i have ever seen and im so happy to have finally been able to have a true diagnosis and end my search for help. Dr. Urie is brilliant when it comes to pain issues and the body and has truly given me hope for my future. If you are looking for a true way to get your life back with severe medical pain issues you 100% need to have Dr. Urie as your doctor.|Dr Urie was kind, understanding and treated me with respect, He listened to what I had to say and didn't mind that I had questions.. I have been looking for a  solution and got one.. Thanks to you and your great Staff..|I had a good experience with Dr. Bradley A. Urie.
My experience is that Dr. Bradley A. Urie is willing to listen to his patients and interested in helping.|Dr Urie does a excellent job on pain management!

Robert|Best pain management Doctor office! Dr. West is the great! He listens to you and can help in every way! He has the best team! Everyone is super friendly and very helpful! I recommend them to everyone I know!|My appointment was scheduled for 1pm. Because of traffic congestion and the landscaping crew (their vehicles were parked as to not allow the parking spaces to be  reached) at the clinic I walked in the clinic doors at 1:01pm. Walked in, there were 7 people in line at the reception desk so I took the elevator to where Dr. West's off ice was located. It was no longer there. I took the elevator back down  to the 1st floor. It was now 1:07pm I stood in line to talk to the receptionist. There were 3 persons in line at that time. I made it to the receptionist and was told it is now 1:19pm. I was told I had to to reschedule because Dr. West was with his final appointment of the day. Which means I would still be waiting for my appointment either way if I had been early. I usually wait approximately 10 minutes prior to seeing the doctor before I am called into the office to wait in the room. So it would not have made any difference. I rescheduled.
I suggest finding a solution in parking, scheduling, line and waiting room waiting policies and also stop moving Dr. West's office. I can not rate an appointment that did not happen.|I appreciate Dr. West so much! Over the last few years in his care my quality of life has improved significantly. He never dismisses my complaints, and he's willing to work together to find multifaceted solutions that work for me personally. He has taken the time to understand my genetic condition, which many medical professionals fail to take time to do. His entire team is so professional. Having physical therapy, counseling, and pharmacology as part of a chronic pain management team is essential!  He even has a walking group.
Care that centers on the whole person seems to have a better outcome. Bravo!|I love Dr. West and his staff. They are efficient and kind and caring.

I've previously been with a pain clinic and now that I've been to Wasatch Pain I know the previous doctor didn't care. From the first initial call to having injections done it's all been good. Lots of follow up, which I love and need. My injection today was quick and painless.|All the staff have been wonderful; Shannel has been especially kind and helpful to me.

They have positively changed my life forever|I have come to Wasatch Pain Solution for several issues over the years and I've always had good experiences with great results. They have treated my knees with Regenexx stem cell procedure. My shoulders with steroid injection. Given me advice on physical therapy locations. I've even sent several family members to Wasatch who have also had great results for back pain, foot problems, hip and knee pains. I would 10/10 recommend Wasatch to anyone.|I love Wasatch Pain Solution! After years of going to other pain clinics and receiving  unsuccessful treatments and injections, I finally have had 50% pain relief from Wasatch! The staff is exceptionally kind and Shawn, my PA, always listens, understands and actively tries to find ways to help me. The whole experience is always positive and hopeful.|I have been going here for a few months, and so far I've been impressed. I have gotten several injections trying to pinpoint where my pain is coming from. I think we've figured out one part of the solution. Shawn Pendleton PA has listened to me and taken me seriously.
I would love to actually be introduced to Dr. Qamar Khan before a procedure. I'm actually unsure if it's him giving me the injections or not.
The office staff at both the Pleasant Grove and South Jordan offices have been kind and caring as well.|I really can't understand these reviews but I can just tell you what I experienced. I have had shots before in Florida and nothing compares to the first class treatment this clinic offers.
From the time I made my appointment, meeting  Chad (who is the PA) and the nurse, meeting the front desk employee EVERYONE has been super organized, extremely friendly and very professional. They really did care about how much pain I was in. My appointments are emailed an texted to me, remind me and they follow up with me.
Yesterday I went for my first shot in Jordon address, AGAIN EVERYONE extremely professional, organized and caring towards my pain. I got my shot  and today I FEEL FANTASTIC!!! I haven't felt this good in years.
I can not say enough good things about everyone there. Didn't even meet Dr Khan (well except when I was facing down to get my shot) lol
but he did a fantastic job I would say!! I am so pleased I feel like I am 20 again. Thanks to everyone there!!|I have been a client of Wasatch Pain Solutions for several years. This office is in the business of making money. I thought they were trying to help me. But after 2+ years, the pain that I suffer from, keeps returning. They have not offered stem cell services or anything that would provide a permanent solution. They are happy that I keep returning for more treatment. I keep their wallets well padded. I am beyond frustrated with this office. You would think that a place where I pay as much money as I do they would be friendly when I call. Half the time, they act like they don't know who I am. There is no personalization by anyone besides Colin, the PA or Anna, one of the receptionists. It is because of these two individuals that they get a 2 star rating from me and not a 0 star.

Marinda paskett for pain managment. She has been extremely helpful in helping me manage my pain. She helps find what best works for you. I see DR. Jahan Imanhi I see him as my neurologist. He is a very smart man that really wants to help his patients.
The only way you'll have a bad experience is if you don't take you medication responsibly and lie to your Drs.|I have been a patient of Mirinda's for a year now. If wasn't for her I wouldn't know what is really going on with my body. I would recommend her to anyone.
I am also a patient of Dr imani. Last September we found out I have a pseudotumor cerebri. Imani had been amazing at helping me to figure out what is wrong. On numerous occasions he has wanted me in that day for a procedure. But to my amazement his ""nurse"" does not follow instructions. I was told in February after my second spinal tap that I needed to have a Shunt placed immediately. So after a week I called back because I had not heard anything. And I got yelled at by his nurse Sharon for calling. So since February after finding out that the referral they sent out was not covered on my insurance. I asked for her help and she replied with it is the patients responsibility to find a nuersugeon. So for the last 3 months I've been trying to get into imani to see what our options are. Every time I schedule an apt with the front desk sharon calls and says imani doesn't want to see me, or that I have an outstanding bill that no one told me about every month I go in. Or any other excuse she can come up with. I've talked to my pain dr and there is nothing she can do. And she doesn't understand why Sharon is so cold and rude to me. I have been very patient in dealing with this woman. But a couple weeks ago we found out my mother has the same pseudotumor. And of course I was like go see imani. With her first apt our car over heated and we were 5 minutes late and they would not see her. She was then rescheduled for Monday. At that time I scheduled my apt right after hers in hopes we could kill 2 birds with 1 stone. So we went in and I was told I could not be seen. Again. So my mother is getting checked in and they tell her she has a $50 deductible. They take her papers back to Sharon and a few minutes later the girl at the front desk was on the phone with someone saying ""yeah it's Amanda's mom"" . Then she came back out and told my mom she had to pay $100 or could not be seen. My mom was extremely upset seems how her being a patient has nothing to do with me being a patient. We left. Got down the road and mom realized she didn't get her papers back so we turn around. She goes in and Sharon refuses to give back her papers saying she needs them. At this point I'm upset. It's one thing to bully me but why are you bullying my mom. So I made some calls to find out what can be done with this nurse that has made my life a living hell. I've had to call drs from ogden to provo and get a copy of my referral from Sharon because she refused to send it off. So I had to fax my referral of to numerous drs trying to get a Shunt put in my head. I'm suffering from extreme headaches, losing my vision and hearing because if the pressure in my head from this pseudotumor. And she will not let me see Dr imani. Yesterday I spoke to someone at Utah department of professional licensing. He then tried to contact Sharon because how I'm being treated is illegal for a licensed nurse. Come to find out she is not even a nurse. But she is giving shots and drawing blood? Scary now that I know the truth. I have called several times to speak with imani and she won't let me. And as of today my apts with my pain dr have been canceled. With no one answering me as to why. Pretty sure it's illegal to cut a patient on pain meds off like that? I have absolutely no problems or issues with anyone in this office besides Sharon. But my mother was discriminated against by Sharon. And I've been treated poorly. We are contacting lawyers because of this. We will be filing a discrimination lawsuit against Sharon. I hope to hear from mirinda and imani to get this matter fixed. Again my only problem is being treated poorly by Sharon while I'm in need of a very serious surgery and can go blind at any moment. Thank you. Hope to settle this and have my drs back I need them.|Run for your life!  I would ask around to find a clinic better than this one.  If you want to be degraded, and humiliated and treated like a druggie, then by all means go here.  Jennifer the nurse assistant is one of the WORST people I've ever had to work with in the medical community.  You will be made to feel awful for having chronic pain or disease. Marinda is good, but only when you have access to her which is during your appointment.  If you have ANY issues in between that time you are screwed because they have gatekeepers who will treat you terrible.  No one should be made to feel the way these people treat you.|Best clinic we've ever been to. They actually LISTEN to their patients & don't try to tell their patients how they feel. We highly recommend this place & we tell all our family when they need a pain clinic. Love Skyline.|I'm the type of person that gives everyone a chance regardless of what others say about them. So I decided to give them a shot even after reading all of the terrible reviews on google and yelp. Horrible mistake. Almost lost coverage of my medications because they made me sign something that said I was being treated for something I wasn't being treated for. I went their for pain management and they treated me like an addict. Called me in every week to count my pills and I had to show up within 24hours of them calling me or they were going to cut me off? They also made me see a social worker which they claimed everyone had to see which is total bs. They also made me pay for it twice. They said it would be $X but it was $X+$Y they make you do urine screens every time you go In. They literally make you do urine screens every time you go in which I was okay with but once they started making me call out of work to go in and count my pills that's when enough was enough. If you want pain management go to dr coles at tanner clinic. They treat you with compassion and respect and they are sincere. You can tell they actually care and will do anything to make you feel welcome and comfortable and a patient instead of some addict. Horrible experience please save your time and money. Take it from someone who gives everyone a chance. Learn from my mistake. Good luck.|Unfortunately, being in chronic pain is a hard thing to live with.  I am grateful for the Dr.'s at Skyline Pain  Clinic  to help me live the best active lifestyle I can achieve at this moment!

It was not, let's see if we can squeeze you in. It was ""you will need to come back"". I have waited over 30 minutes to been seen, but one minute passed their policy and canceled.

But I got billed incorrectly. They charged my insurance over $8,000 for botox to treat my migraines. I tried talking to Lakeview hospital, this clinic, and the billing company.
Only one person said she would help me. By giving me number and emails to use to contact the correct person to talk to. But after multiple attempts and months and hours of my time. I could not get a hold of that person.  And every other person said they could help me with payment plans but that all.
They billed the wrong codes so I couldn't even use the botox reimbursement program. And I tried to tell them but they refused.
I called multiple other clinic and got quotes for this procedure and they were all around $2,000. And those clinics also verified the codes that would be billed were not the ones I got billed for.
You will get good care here from the providers. But you are risking having fraudulent billing done and being forced to pay thousands of dollars more. I would recommend looking elsewhere that will provide accurate billing, good customer service, along with there great medical care.|Dr. Nelson & team are absolutely the best. They have been taking CARE of me for many years.
PT. Des Hammer has helped myself in many ways. Her Suggestions have helped me tremendously. .|I don't have a problem with the doctor I saw.  It was a normal doctor visit.  The reason for the low rating is the extra bill I received on top of the doctor's bill.  I wish I was informed prior to the visit and not in the waiting room when  I was required to sign several documents that I was going to be billed from both the doctor and Lakeview Hospital for my appointment.  Apparently Lakeview hospital bills an additional $200 just for using ""their facilities"" and by using ""their facilities"" it means you have an appointment at the center.  Lakeview hospital performed no other services.  The hospital bill was almost the same price as the doctor's bill. I noticed that the Utah Pain Management Center's official website does not include the Bountiful site as a place to leave feedback. I'm guessing that in order to keep their 5 star rating they don't want patients leaving feedback about this dishonest double billing practice agreement that they have going on between them and Lakeview Hospital.|Thank you for helping me with a chronic pain problem I've had since I was little!

NO doctor will take the time to ever listen to me, they look at me and immediately so ""no you're too young to be having these problems"" or ""there's not much we can do about back pain these days"". When i met with Dr. Urie i immediately felt seen and HEARD. His bedside manner is incredible and Mrs. Urie was so kind. He took the time to listen to me and come up with a pain management plan that worked for the both of us. I am so incredibly grateful for Dr. Urie!! I feel like he gave me my life back. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone struggling with pain. He is highly professional and very knowledgeable. Everyone in this office is just kind and caring and they treat you with respect.|So I have been dealing with chronic back pain since about 2010. I have had injections, resotomy, I've tried different shoes, physical therapy, I had my SI joint fused and I've had my lower L4, L5 and S1 fused back in November 2023. We thought that would help.  I've been so frustrated with the pain that I didn't have a good quality of life.  So one day I meet Dr. Urie and his wife Sandra and talk to them. Really nice people. I made an appointment to go talk to him about different things that we could try. So back in June I decided to go with an injection with this medication I had never heard of.  It worked. I couldn't believe it. Well then I decided to have a pain pump put in. I cannot tell you how happy I am with the results.  Dr. Urie did a wonderful job and took good care of me.  I would definitely recommend him. If your having back pain or any other kind of issues. Go see Dr. Urie.  They have been so kind to me.
Thank you Dr. Urie and Sandra.

Christine spillman|Thank you again Dr. Urie. Today my epidural  reduced the pain in my head and neck substantially. You are the best. So is your staff and family.|I have a rare disease that causes me severe and almost constant pain. I've been treated unkindly by even pain management specialists and have experienced their unscrupulous practices including prescribing ""breakthrough"" pain meds which promptly made my long term pain med ineffective.
Dr Urie is the first doctor that I've ever felt totally safe with. He's knowledgeable, kind and compassionate. When I'm at my appointment he's completely devoted to me, I'm never rushed, he's very thorough and listens to every thing I want to discuss. He is the expert so I ask him questions about what might best for my treatment and I take his advice because I know he knows what he's doing and if I feel strongly about something and he feels it's safe for me then we'll try it, but if he knows it's not going to be good or safe for me then he explains why and we find an alternative.
Dr Urie has been slandered here beyond description by what looks to me people who were unhappy that they weren't able to control this doctor into prescribing meds in an unhealthy manner or people who were unwilling to pay their bill. The office staff has always been very kind and professional and have never been dishonest in their billing practices with me. If you've been a patient of his even once it's clear that he truly cares for his patience and their suffering. I would recommend him to my family and would know they were in great hands.|I have been coming here since March. I love Dr. Urie and his Wife Sandra and everyone else in the office. I have been to many doctors and they have all made me feel like a bad person or a pill seeker. So yes at first I was worried that again I would not be heard. But to my amazement that did not happen. Both I and my husband see him. They always schedule us together. During covid-19 we lost our jobs. No money to pay for our visits they never turned us away. Dr. Urie and Sandra are both very good, understanding, caring and compassionate. I highly recommend this Doctor to anyone struggling with pain and never being taken seriously by many other doctors. I will forever be grateful for them giving us our lives back and make it possible to be happier and better parents to our children. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NEVER GIVING UP ON MY FAMILY. Danielle White from Wyoming|I could not have found a better doctor for my pain management. Dr Urie has been great for me: he even came to my house with his nurse for a home visit! What doctors do that nowadays?!? He's been very responsive to my needs, and he really listens to me when I speak with him.|I first started seeing Dr Urie nearly a year ago and things have just gone downhill since. First notable reason for the 1 star is that although most doctors would worry about a patient having withdrawals from being taken off a medication they had prescribed them, he does not care whatsoever. He insists on watching the time as patients are supposed to be arriving and if you're even fifteen seconds late he makes you reschedule.  He insists on patients driving themselves even if said patient has such severe spinal and nerve problems that they are constantly randomly losing complete control of their limbs. He also gets angry with patients if they need to reschedule even if rescheduling is done in advance.  I originally had problems with him due to him not listening very well about my pain problems and what caused my pain and other symptoms. He instead wanted to just immediately do injections and when that didn't work he insisted on just throwing some heavy medicine at me to get me to go home.  I am the type of person that tries to give everyone a fair chance so decided I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and try working with him for a bit to see how good of a doctor he really was as there were some traits to him that made me think he might be nice. I sure was wrong for doing that though as I learned the hard way. If you're considering seeing him please be sure to weigh your options and check out other doctors first as he is not one that you will enjoy unless of of course you enjoy being yelled at and treated like garbage by a doctor in a formal setting as he would literally gey upset and as my mother said(she went with me to witness how terrible he treated me) he liked to rip off my head over simple things like me not being able to urinate in a timely manner or things out of my control such as whata neurosurgeo said about working on my spine.  Also be warned if you're an overweight person that he does discriminate and treat you worse if you're overweight even if you're working really hard on losing weight.
On top of the way he treats you his nurse is just as rude. Any time I would even try to strike up a friendly conversation she would simply scowl at me. The one time I showed up late to an appointment by exactly 15 minutes which she said would be fine she instead got upset with me because it took me 2 minutes to wait for her( I called for a medical assist and she just let it ring and ring until I was officially too late by 2.5 minutes) and by the time she walked outside I was considered too late. She then proceeded to argue with me stating I supposedly did not call in spite of me showing her on my phone that I had. She also would constantly treat me like I was garbage compared to her because I am an overweight broke single mom who doesn't have much family or friends nearby and had to bring my son with me to appointments. They both treated him like he was an absolute nuisance.
Don't go to this doctor unless you're willing to put up with being treated so poorly.|In 2015 I broke my neck back and pelvis in a semi accident in Alaska. I have been in constant pain since the accident and have been to many pain managing Dr.'s to no avail. In 2017 I moved to Utah and have been to 3 different places to get this under control. I met Dr. Bradly Urie in 2018 and I am happy to have my life back and my pain under control. I am able to travel and play with my grandchildren again. My pain has been under control with just some minor adjustments made to my medication. Amazing what adjustments can do from a dr who listens to your concerns and is truly there to help!!

I'll be looking for a new Dr on the other side of the mountain.|I was seen locally by an Ortho specialist who was unable to do a hip injection, something I was receiving previously in another state. I was referred to this clinic for the injection.

The earliest appointment for a new patient was June of 2024, I was seen by the Ortho doctor December 2023.

After trying to wait I spoke with the receptionist who informed me that there is no way to be seen sooner. After expressing my frustration at being in pain and waiting this long seems awfully cruel to do to a person, that I was not trying to be mean or difficult but I am tired of hurting I was told I was coming across rude/mean and there was nothing that could be done.

I tried to keep my business local but obviously they have plenty of business.

It's nice to have this type of clinic here but to make a person wait, who's had a diagnosis already made, been receiving injections elsewhere be given a wait time like this before even being seen is cruel and lacking in empathy.

Dr Garg is competent and the staff are friendly enough. Prices are what you can expect from US healthcare.

The waits are terribly long even for simple procedures. Crummy scheduling and time management. They are always behind with little care to update patients on when they will be attended to. After waiting for over an hour and a half we got a simple ""sorry to keep you waiting"". I know that not everything can be done on schedule in the medical world but it's just ridiculous.

On my most recent visit the restroom available to patients was devoid of any toilet paper and only a few scraps of paper towels left. Very disappointing!

I would NOT recommend this practice.|this is not the clinic to go to if you need help. I came to Dr. Garg with the hopes that he could try something new. He pressured me into a steroid back injection which did not work. Then during my post visit, he pressured me to state that the procedure worked so that way insurance would pay for it. then he encouraged me that the second injection would fix the problem. I had the same experience. On my post visit once again, he pressured me to state that it was at least 50% better so that way the insurance would pay for it and then try to schedule me for two other injections . I scheduled a follow up at the front desk for 30 days later, and I tried to come in for my appointment and I was told that there was never an appointment made and that they would need to schedule me out for another month. The woman I spoke to at the front desk was extremely rude and had zero empathy. Which is surprising because she works in a field. Where empathy is virtually required to do your job. The nurse practitioner I was seeing on one of my follow-ups spent the whole time telling me how she was leaving the practice because it was not a good place To work, and we spent no time discussing new options. I'm really tired of healthcare Facilities, taking advantage of people in need and treating them so terribly, especially when we're spending so much money for our healthcare and office visits and supporting everybody in that clinic. It should've been obvious in the beginning based upon the experience I had where literally you're just a number and you're just money in their pockets and procedures are just a pathway to Make money and not a means of solving any problems, other than the financial problems of the doctor. I'm considering going to the state and also my insurance company discussing insurance fraud and Malpractice. It is not appropriate to treat people people so poorly and expect them to spend so much money For, hope, And leaving the patient with no support and once again, Dr shopping to find somebody who actually cares About their patients. This is not the place to go for healthcare. Dr. Garg is not the kind of medical practitioner I would ever refer out to any friends or family.|I have been in the care of Dr. Garg since March of 2016. He is an amazing doctors and has helped me with my whole entire spine and wrists pain. He is so nice, friendly, caring, and treats you like family as do his staff. I would not go anywhere else. I appreciate everything he and his staff do for us.|Called to make an appointment and the lady who answered was very rude. She continually cut me off when I was trying to provide my information. She asked me to verify my insurance and once I did she was silent for 5 minutes. I asked if she had what she needed and she said oh (like she forgot I was there) no I need to send your info to referrals. And hung up. No information or when to expect a call from referrals and no appointment scheduled.|Dr Garg is an amazing pain specialist, if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have any quality of life at all. I've broken my lower back 3 times, was in constant pain with debilitating episodes a few time a year. I get 4 injections in my SI joint one a year and live a normal active life in construction. I tried another doctor about 8 years ago and the procedure took almost 2 hrs from waiting room to finished, with dr Garg I'm in and out in 20 min. He is the best and a super nice guy
Pain free Greg Pack|Not a fan of Garg. He's not friendly and only pops in quickly to give an injection then he disappears spending only a couple mintues with the patient. He makes a ton of money off these injections too. Every injection I've had with him has been extremely painful and not once have they provided any relief so I saw another doctor from different office that gave me my next injection and there was no pain what so ever and I  experienced good pain relief. I've been seeing the PA's in Gargs office for a few years but there have been a few times my regular PA has been out on vacation when my medication is due for refill so I've had to schedule my next appointment one week later and I've been instructed to call the office to have one weeks worth of medication called into the pharmacy to get me through until my next appointment. Each and every time Garg has refused to call the prescriptions in and has never given me the courtesy of returning my calls to discuss it. In my opinion Garg is more interested in earning the almighty dollar and less interested in providing the best quality of life possible for his patients.|Very frustrating experience.

My daughter has fibromyalgia and ME/CFS, so she can only work a couple of hours per week and cannot support herself.  In order for her to stay on my insurance after she turns 26, our insurance company (Blue Cross Blue Shield) requires a doctor to fill out a form assessing her level of incapacitation.  We have gotten the runaround from everyone we've spoken with about this, and the deadline is quickly approaching, so when I called Dr. Garg's office, I was very clear with the appointment scheduler about what we needed and asked if any of the doctors there could help with this--with the approaching deadline, we cannot afford to wait for an appointment, only to be told at that appointment that they cannot help us.  The scheduler assured me that Dr. Garg could help and scheduled us for the following week, which felt like a small miracle.  I sent the office a follow-up email to reiterate what we needed (and with the insurance form attached) right after our conversation, and she responded that they had received it.

At our appointment, we went through the standard intake procedure of filling out forms, repeating the same information to the triage person, repeating the same information a second time to the RN, and then waiting for the doctor.  It was clear that no one had read the email or reviewed the form, and when Dr. Garg arrived, he surprised us by saying that he probably cannot help us--he said he would look over the form in a few days and get back to us.

This was extraordinarily frustrating because I was very careful to make this clear on the phone with the scheduler.  Like I said, we don't have time to waste on this issue.  In addition, I took time off of work to get my daughter there, and most importantly, my daughter's health issues mean that there is a ""cost"" of her physically going to any appointment.  Usually (we hope), that cost is offset by the benefit of receiving treatment.  Here, the cost was entirely wasted, and they seemed completely oblivious to that, even though they specialize in chronic issues/pain.

They refunded our copay and promised to better train the appointment scheduler.  Hopefully they do that before they put someone else through this.

I'll update my rating if Dr. Garg is able to help us.  That won't change what happened, of course, but it would mean that the cost to my daughter would be offset by the benefit that brought us to him in the first place.

UPDATE: It's been over a month and we have not heard one word back from Dr. Garg's office.|I had neck pain for almost a year.  I tried everything that I could think of and had no relief.  I came here on a recommendation from a friend and they were able to get rid of the pain with some injections.

Dr. Garg went out of his way to help me. I needed one last injection in a series of 3 before it would be complete.  It was the end of the year, the last of December, the last day they were going to be open until the new year.  I wanted to get it done by the end of the year because my insurance would go up and I'd have to start over with meeting my deductible  and he and his staff worked it with my insurance to get me seen the very same day. So thanks to him I am pain-free now without having to pay extra money.

I'd recommend him to anyone.",2024-12-12|2024-04-04|2024-04-26|2024-05-31|2023-06-28|2023-03-28|2023-06-14|2020-02-08,2|1|5|1|5|1|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJjQxKbFuJUocRC1cc71dQgLw,20

He is very knowledgeable and caring. You won't find better.|I was recently seen for some concerns I had by Dr beecher. Normally I see Trent. Dr beecher was extremely rude. His nurse was extremely rude. They both acted like I was a burden. A bane of their existence. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't think that my chronic illness (elhers danlos syndrome) was ""painful"". Every person is different. Especially regarding eds. Doctor's like him are the reason people who are chronically Ill don't see doctors. He needs a serious lesson on bedside manner and empathy. I will go see someone over the mountain from now on rather than go to him.|$300+ just for a consultation...... there was some kind of mix up with my insurance. I didn't want to deal with the insurance run around, so I wanted to pay out of pocket. They couldn't pull up my bill for some reason so I couldn't pay. They said they would call me as soon as they found the issue, for months I didn't hear a word from them.
So, I went in again to see if they figured it out and yup, they did yet no call, email nada. I paid my bill and asked if I could possibly get a letter from one of the Doctors suggesting I go to a gym to lose some weight, so my HSA will cover it. Something that would take literally 5 minutes. They said they would call me, again.
Surprisingly they did call this time, a week later.
Now considering I have been visiting them off and on since I was 15, you'd think they would have a good idea of my back issues, but they said since I haven't been seen in a little over a year, I'd have to get another consultation! If you would have called me the first time, it would have been under a year. Regardless, seems to me that they just want to squeeze me for more cash and my time.

Seriously concerning and disappointing.|I posted previously how excellent a clinic this is. somehow it disappeared. Dr Beecher, Trent Greenhalgh,and all the staff are the best I have ever received care from.I am wheelchair bound and they give me something you can't buy..HOPE AND GOOD HUMOUR.
I thank them all.posted 2024|Below I've listed my first review of one star. I'm updating this to three stars because Russ was much kinder to me and a he seemed less judgemental on our return visit.

Its like Dr Beecher was having a contest with me the last and only three times I've seen him. He wanted me to get another steroid shot, which my surgeons told me not to do since I've had two bad reactions the only two times I had them. Dr Beecher wouldn't recommend anything else. When I asked about a medical marijuana card, which I'm a text-book candidate for with my severe chronic pain and nausea, he turned me down because I have depression, even though he said right before that, ""almost everyone with chronic pain has depression"". In the end, I think he is just upset that I wouldn't get a steroid shot.|I would not recommend Dr. Beecher. I have to pay for two different doctor visits because Dr. Beecher does not listen or take his patients seriously.  Please save yourself the time and money and see someone who will take your injury seriously and will complete the necessary tests to help identify the problem!!
Dr. Beecher dismissed my husbands symptoms and blamed his pain on a past injury. As he described his situation as ""muddy"" even though both nerves in the arm was showing abnormal signs (which he stated). His recommendation was further imaging that is expensive and the type of test is not common.
Our doctor couldn't even use his results and required us to see another specialist in the field; who immediately identified the problem.

I've never left with questioned about my treatment nor have I ever felt rushed.
I've been in to see him for 3 different injections.
He's always informative throughout the process.
Even in a very uncomfortable situation,
Dr. Glines and his staff somehow manage to make sure you feel comfortable.
Great staff, waiting time and all around a pleasant experience.
Highly recommended!|Dr Glines' was professional and competent, I wish I could say this about his office staff. Had issues with his staff requesting the correct procedure; twice we had to resubmit the authorization because they selected the wrong code. Once they submitted the correct code found out the only submitted the code for one side, wouldn't have been an issue if they tried to resolve the problem they created but didn't care to help out or accept responsibility. Won't go back, unfortunate because he seems like he actually cares and would be a good physician looking out for your needs not worth the hassle though.|The good:
Dr. Glines is friendly, knowledgeable, and an overall good Pain specialist.  He is amazing at epidural procedures, and very fast.
He takes care of his patients
The bad,
His staff is abysmal. They are slow to check in, slow to process information, and it may take weeks to process mri info sent to them, half the time the dr doesn't get the mri info because they can't get it to him or lose it, even if hand delivered.
The UGLY:
You can't talk to a real nurse.  The line tells you to wait 48 hours, I waited and received no call back. Twice.|Glines is the best.  See him about every 2 years when the back flares up.    He's super friendly and they get me scheduled quick.  The even deal with the hassle of getting it approved by my insurance company.|Have been treated numerous times by Dr Glines.

I met NP Matt Jarvis today - he is a great addition.|I had been going to St Marks Interventional pain Clinic for about 10 years, and was working with a great doctor, that knew what he was doing. I receive a call one day, saying I would no longer be seeing that doctor, that Dr Glines and Chuck Jarvis, would be treating me from now on, and that they were moving to a new bigger Clinic. In my first visit with dr. Glines he decided, that he was going to uproot everything, that I had been doing, and that was working for the past 10 years, that he was going to, have me start all over, by doing expensive invasive procedures, that I had already done, that did not work. I explained to them, that I had already done these, that they were expensive and I wasn't going to spend that kind of money again. I was informed it was their way or the highway. Knowing the whole thing was about making money, for their big new shiny Clinic, and to put money in their pockets, and the pain clinics pockets. I chose to move on. I do not recommend the St Mark's Interventional pain clinic to anybody. I recommend a long extensive search into another option.|Dr. Glines is an incredible Dr. but his ""back office staff"" really suck (the front office are great!).  They forget to file for pre-approvals etc., etc....  Then tell you less than the truth when you call to ask about them.  After you call your insurance company you find they have the exact time and date of the fax (down to the seconds) of when they ordered your procedure.  Often you will find they have waited ""5"" business days or more before even bothering to possess the request.  The nurses line has always called me back but only one of the nurses is even listening,  the other nurse is like talking to a wall.  She never gets your message straight (that you want to give the Dr.) It is really hard when you are having a problem and actually need to talk to the Dr., you can't only the nurse...  then she (they) can't get the message right.  I would be happy to come in for another appointment when there is a problem escalation but usually they can't get you in before your next appointment anyway. It is a vicious circle.  By your appointment it is too late !!!!  You have suffered through couple of weeks from hell with no temporary treatment (for no reason because help ""could"" have been available if only the Dr. knew) .  I even tried telling them that this behavior that often causes a real problem at my work because I can't give them any answers and they just give you the same empathy answered they have been brainwashed to give. ""We are really sorry about that"" or ""We are really sorry for your pain"".  It just makes you want to scream!!!!!

I have never felt more comfortable talking with a doctor. He got me back to a tolerable pain. I still have to take med but at least they work now instead of barely taking the pain away. I highly recommend this facility.|I my opinion Dr Matsumura is a dangerous Dr, especially when it comes to prescribing pain meds. My sister was under his care when she overdosed. She had seen him for years , she had Chrones . She was given morphine suckers, OxyContin fetynal patches and more. Dr. Matsumura should have seen her addiction but no he just kept prescribing month after month and year after year. I have waited 4 years to get this off my chest, no he didn't make her take all these drugs but he prescribed them. She would visit us in Idaho Falls and Walgreens couldn't refill all those meds, because they didn't have all she took. Dr Matsumura finally kicked her out with a one month supply and a list of drug rehabs, which addicted people usually refuse to go to on their own. I only wish I knew how to have Dr Matsumura investigated as I would be interested to know how many of his patients have overdosed.|Really bad experience,  in my entire life i don't believe ive dealt with someone in the medical field that has been so unkind, condescending and incompetent. If you enjoy being pumped full of drugs,  procedures not being done properly,  getting totally torn into for wanting to ask the doctor some questions before a procedure and being told that you're being a waste of his time because he has 40 other people waiting up get this same thing done and needs to  ""get this over with"".

If you have a procedure, they'll get you in tomorrow, if you have concerns, questions, or issues,  you wont be seen for over a month. $$$ > quality patient care. Totally greed driven.

This is the best pain clinic in the whole valley! Everyone is so kind and willing to help. Dr Nakken and the rest of the staff were so accommodating and helpful to my needs and wants pain wise and helping me figure out which option to go about my pain best! I love this place and definitely recommend!!|this clinic is amazing, they have helped so much with my migraines, they have helped tremendously with my anxiety aswell! Dr. Nakken does Stellate Ganglion Blocks for the anxiety and panic attacks and i can't even explain how much it helps. Thank you to them ends of the earth Dr. Nakken! I can't think of anyone else i would trust to stab me in the back! The office manager Nikki is the sweetest woman, she always takes care of everyone the best she can, I always see her out in the lobby helping patients and checking in on them the best she can!|My mother in-law has been coming here. The doctors are kind, they listen and have great bedside manner. They also don't make her pay for a bunch of extra text she doesn't need. The ladies up front are super nice too! I would highly recommend a visit!!!|I already wrote my review but your response was that ""I've never been a patient there!"" 1st, my name is ""Barbara ARMSTRONG"", not MORRELL! (I remarried almost 3 yrs ago!) I have been a patient for many years, 1st when it was Nexus, then Riverwood pain & spine. I always had a great experience until the last 3 or so months when the new office manager Nikki took over and the disrespect and demeaning attitude towards me caused severe anxiety before each visit ending with me crying! She treated me like I was a liar and abuser ( as did the Dr) when it was a total lie, over just a one time misunderstanding! I would never recommend Riverwood until the new office manager can change her approach to people who are in need of understanding and help! So disappointed! Looking for a new clinic that has compassion and sincere caring of it's patients. I'm aware this won't get posted cus I'm sure they want only praise!  I'm a 74 yr old woman that must have pain management to be able to do my job, on my feet for 7 hrs!|The office manager I think they pulled her off skid row ver rude doesn't dress professionally at all smells of rancid cigarette smoke called out both me and my wife lier s even after we proved het wrong she had the Gail to say they have moved on well we haven't my wife deserves an apology I have never been treated so rude by an supposedly office. Manager I got very upset and shouldn't have but my wife is a very honest person after 30 years I should know when my wife was in with the doctor she came looking for her I think because she thought we were over the 5 minute late window which we were not  then kicked her out of the office she was told to wait on very rudely|I have been in Diane and Jason's care for several years now. When I first went, I was immobile. I was in so much pain! Diane took the time to visit with me and actually listen to my concerns and problems. I've had several procedures done along with a medication regimen that has allowed me to actually LIVE! It took some time of course, but I am FINALLY comfortable and able to be the mom I am needed to be for my kids. I cannot recommend this practice enough! Thank you both for all that you do!|The front desk people are inadequate could lol  care less  about you and your pain or problems they give you a prescription then without notice cancel it the office manager called my wife a lier k called her out she said they had moved o. From it I said we haven't the office manager must have come off of skid row ver rude and unprofessional I was also rude and will app o bet she has never apologized in her life she belongs back on skid row the way she dresses not professional At all for an office manager she needs to go home take  bath  the room smells like rancid smoke when she walks in she kicked my wife out of an office that she was told she could wait in|I saw Dr. Nakken & Diane when they were in Provo and were so happy when they opened their own practice.

Although insurance approvals slow things down at times, and can be frustrating, I can usually always get in quickly and efficiently once the insurance is accepted. I believe insurance is most of the reason frustrations can develop while trying to expedite our pain management. His staff is always kind and helpful and Dr. Nelson is personable and caring while determining the problems and then again when administering the procedure to solve our pain.  He is a wonderful doctor!|Over the past 4 years, I have visited/scheduled/been seen by 13 different medical professionals in an attempt to diagnose my medical condition.  I was referred to Dr. Nelson from a colleague at work.  Although his office is a bit of a drive for me, I scheduled an appointment with him.

On my FIRST visit, Dr. Nelson pointed out the possible culprit. In an attempt to verify/clarify, he scheduled me for a visit to one of his colleagues. They nailed it!  I'm now in the process of being treated for my condition.

My experience with Dr. Alex Nelson, his staff and colleagues, has been extremely professional, friendly, honest and spot on!

I recommend his knowledge and expertise to anyone willing to explore avenues of healing!|Dr. Nelson and Desiree are my absolute favorite providers. They're both so caring and have been amazing with my treatments/ care. They take their time especially on the days that I am in more pain than usual when I am having any of my injections. I refuse to see anyone else even if that means I pay a bit more for my copay. Bree is one of my favorite MAs as well, my last visit I was extremely exhausted and she brightened my day. Bree also goes to bat for me whenever my insurance or the speciality pharmacy is being a pain. I go here for spinal pain and chronic migraines. I will never see any other providers.|Finding Dr. Nelson and his team has been life changing for me.  Being treated respectfully allows me to be candid and open about the functional issues that up until recently have been dismissed by others doctors noting my age with disbelief of my symptoms.  There are many ways to combat pain that do not involve narcotics.  I refer others to Interventional Spine and Pain Management with confidence!|Dr Nelson has treated me for two years, with his knowledge and my useless reading the internet we have tried everything to stop my back pain. I needed to lose weight to have surgery, I've lost 80 lbs. First we're trying pain block to see if that works, if not looks like surgery might be next. Dr Nelson is one of the most pleasant doctors I've seen.|Edit: I wrote this review in place of my wife, Carmina I. She will be in your records. You will see my name under her file. So, no, I will not remove this review.

If you're looking for an adequate job that doesn't exceed your expectations, these folks are just the type. The staff is nice enough, but give odd looks to you if you ask too many questions. I've had to ask for my MRI scans on 4 seperate occasions with three different people and it took me over 6 weeks to finally get them. The staff also appears to, what feels like, worship Dr. Nelson who can be demeaning to female patients. At every appointment, he made comments as to how small or teeny I am. The only reason I stayed with them was because I had a time crunch and essentially no geographical option closer. They'll work, but if I could've gone to other people, I would've. If I could, I would give 0 stars.|***Update, I have now been going here for 9 months.  My opinions on Dr. Nelson have not changed he is kind and caring.  The PA Desiree has been amazing also with my scs implant follow-ups and also with the continued pain.  I love dealing with Laurel she is sweet and the rest of the staff has been great.
I'd recommend this office to friends and family alike.

I have been to the clinic just one time but I have to say that the staff is amazing to deal with.  It takes a bit to get a call back at times but they do call back.  Dr. Neilson is amazing, kind,  understanding and very personable.
To be honest after reading some reviews I had fears but without hesitation they have been wonderful.|I up graded to 4 stars on Jan 14 2025.
Still upset, but now I come to know it wasn't all Dr. Nelson fault things were done that Dr.Nelson didn't know about.

Please disregard original message below.

If you see this Doctor make sure that you review your billing statements. I have had major problems with billing to the point that I will no longer use Dr Nelson as a pain doctor.
I tried to bring this problem to the attention of the billing company, their response was, ""that's just the way we do things here"". I requested a full audit of my account, they came back and said ""we think we forgot to charge you for a visit, so we're adding an additional $35 to your account.  Several times they reported I only paid $30, when I in-fact paid my full copay of $35.
I also brought this to the attention of Dr. Nelson, and his office manager, they came back with, everything looks okay on our end, so you need to pay $200.10 + $35, before you can be seen again. And by the way, you'll need to pay $180 plus the $35 copy from here on out.

One last thing, I had an appointment on Aug 31st, I paid my $35 copay, but when I got to see the Doctor he told me they ordered the wrong Medication, and I would have to come back.
When I went back in 12 days later for my medication, I had to pay a $35 copay AGAIN! So now I had to pay $70 for injection I should have gotten 12 days before. I'm not a happy camper, and I never received a satisfactory answer to my billing questions.",2024-12-04|2024-11-12|2024-11-13|2024-11-10|2024-11-11|2023-11-10|2023-04-18|2021-09-14,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|4,,,"3 p.m.|10 a.m.|4 p.m.",28.166666666666668|23.666666666666668|21.833333333333332,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJLXr9i3gPU4cR2wPxzZ5XWLo,22

They have all went beyond to help with all my needs. They 100% care for their patients and make them feel comfortable.|Dr Talbott is wonderful!  Listens to your problem and explains what should be done to correct the situation.  After many years of pain and epidurals that still did not help while living n Florida, he has finally helped me!  I could not be more pleased.|Holly is a great provider, always answers questions that might have concerns for me. She's very friendly and I really like her a lot. She also make sure that I'm taking care of as far as physical pain. I can't say enough about her and I appreciate The fact that she's always is on time and my whole day is not spent at the doctors office.|As a retired pro hockey player ... the most violent sport,  I've had many experiences with Drs for my jacked up back, shoulders, knees, etc. I've had so many Drs over the years and I can honestly say Talbot is the best of the best!!!|Documented history of chronic pain, pain returned. I went to SWSP to help find the root of the problem, after going to the ER 3 times for pain.

They agreed to give me pain killers until we were able to find another way to manage the pain. Due to their mistake on sending in MRI requests, my MRI was denied and could not be re-requested for 45 days.

The doctor then refused to prescribe more pain medication to get me to the imaging, and to the alternative treatment options. Their answer to my question of what happens when the pain comes back, they said ""go to the ER"".

There is a ""conflicting"" medication I take from another doctor for over 25 years. I called that doctor and they confirmed that not keeping my pain under control was the wrong choice on SWSP.

So now I'll have level 10 pain in about 2 days with no help from the same practice that screwed up my imaging and timeline to begin with. They caused the problem. They won't fix it.

WILL NOT RETURN.

Update after practice response:
Their response is inaccurate as imaging was denied due to lack of providing information that only they have, NOT from an outside provider in ANY WAY. I additionally discovered in my medical records that the insurance company DID try to help them resolve the denial, however the doctor did not do the PVP process offered.

I called to speak with the clinic manager, and when discussing the issue she made me aware that she was not able to address my questions, could not clarify the misunderstandings and actually got quite a bit of an attitude with me while I was professional, calm and polite. She was very upset when I referenced FDA guidelines, and when I asked for a copy of the Risk-Benefit analysis that was done. A risk-benefit analysis template is provided by the FDA, and further encouraged use of this in their updated guidelines in 2021. The doctors here are still operating under the FDA's 2016 guidelines. When I mentioned this, Jessica got VERY upset and in an elevated tone said ""SIR HE IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR..."" as if somehow that makes him a better person than me. It seems to me that this practice will get upset if they think you're telling them how to do their job, when you're simply advocating for your own health.|Dr. Talbott is excellent! His staff as well! Definitely recommend his office!|My appointment was at 10:10am this morning. Waited in the waiting room for 20 minutes than another 45+ minutes in the room for the doctor, So I left!!

I have had it for at least 16 years and have experienced a decline in balance, muscle control, mental ability and walking.  Since I feel the nerves are central to this degeneration, I was interested when an ad for Neuragenex and the new Lehi location arrived in my mailbox.  I set up an intake appointment in spite of the 45 minute drive each way.  Now more than half-way thru treatment I have found much improvement in my right knee and restless, burning legs which were preventing me from sleeping at night.  I look for more improvement as I move through the remaining treatments.  I am also VERY impressed with the staff's helpfulness, friendly manner and knowledge.|The staff is great! Competent, professional and friendly are how I can describe everyone I've met. And the treatments so far (I'm only 1/6th of the way through the regimen) have reduced my pain significantly. I'm looking forward to the rest of the treatment plan and my interactions with the staff!|I went to Neuragenex, Lehi facility, and tried one of their treatments. It was amazing! I've suffered from low back for 20 plus years. Some days I have a hard time bending over. After the treatment I was able to bend over with out stiffness or pain. I look forward to more treatment. The staff was very friendly and interactive!|I spent two visits and time at home filling out paperwork for my appointment. The receptionist took photos of my insurance and drivers license. A total waste of time.  When the staff person brought me in he asked about my select health insurance and said they hadn't been able to work with select health. The receptionist should have known that and saved me all the time and hassle!  Very poor review.  Would not Ed omens that facility.|I always recommend my friends to Neuragenex whenever they come into town here if they have neuropathy pain.  I sent in a friend in last year for fibromyalgia and he said it was awesome.  I hope the location in Lehi is as good as the one close to me.

I think medicine and drugs has a place for pain for sure, but the idea of not having to rely on drugs or needles is awesome.  I can see why some people would want the needles side as well if that is what you are used to.  I like the Neuragenex approach to sciatica and back pain way better though.|I am so impressed with Neuragenex and their team. They want the best outcome for their patients.

My son was only 26 years old and had been suffering for six years with chronic back pain and Dr. Adelman suggested a micro discectomy. The office staff/Dr was very helpful at first, but after the surgery, he found no relief and the same consistent pain. There was no follow up in person or on the phone except when we made the phone call . We asked for referrals to physical therapy and they had none. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this office.

2 months ago, my son had a displacement Replacement with another doctors office. The doctors explained everything so well going into The surgery, have consistently called us for Monthly checkups, sent us to a referred physical therapist and had 24 hour on-call service. What an amazing difference! He was up walking around on day one and is enjoying getting back into nature, Having a social life, and living a great life.|Dr. Adelman and his medical team rocks!! He was recommended to be me by a colleague. I went to see him for a second opinion with my condition. Straightforward, no nonsense, tell it like it is, kind of medicine. He recommended a diagnostic procedure, but didn't make me feel like I needed to do it at his clinic. He even said that I could follow up with my current physician to do it...but that it really should be done for diagnostic purposes. He seemed to be genuinely concerned with getting me back to a pain free existence and the patient seems to be at the heart of his practice. I appreciated his candor and honesty. He has over 30 years of medical experience in the orthopedic surgical field. Clinic was immaculate.|I usually avoid doctors, but Dr. Angela Krull is the best doctor I have ever had to visit.  She is so kind, caring and compassionate and is extremely sharp, dedicated and always helpful.  I have never left her office not feeling better about our treatment plan.  If you have pain or an injury and need excellent care, she is outstanding.  The staff is all very kind and welcoming.|I have been going to The Smart Clinic for five years now and they have been incredible!!! Before finding The Smart Clinic, my search for a
doctor to get any relief from my back pain was a joke. Being 30 with back issues makes doctors skeptical and in return they treat me like garbage without looking at my medical history. I lift weights, played college basketball and now I handle luggage for Delta Air Lines. To say I'm hard on my body is an understatement. It took me a few years of going through awful doctors before I finally made it to The Smart Clinic. Dr. Ancha has been AMAZING! She actually listens to me and has always treated me with kindness and respect. I usually get anxiety when it comes to talking to doctors because they don't listen to me and they downplay what I'm telling them. I know it's not as common for someone as young as I am to have such a bad back, but it does happen and I just want to be taken seriously and treated like doctors care about my well being and the issues that I'm bringing to them to treat. That is exactly how everyone at The Smart Clinic has treated me. The entire staff is easy and pleasant to work with. I always recommend my coworkers to The Smart Clinic because of the wonderful and the attentive service that I receive every time I go in. They have definitely improved my quality of life and they continue to make it better as we keep making progress. Thank you to everyone at The Smart Clinic. You really have made my life so much better.|My wife has had back issues for years and before The Smart Clinic, we were only able to find doctors who didn't believe her and tried to just throw an ibuprofen at the issue and call it quits. The staff here at The Smart Clinic have been the complete opposite. We're still in the process of getting things fixed and it's taken a lot of time but they've never given up on her and never look down on her. When she goes in, I have complete confidence that she's going to be comfortable and treated with kindness and respect. That same kindness and respect is shown to me and our daughter as well. When we go in they treat us like family and make us feel truly loved and appreciated. We had to switch insurance not too long ago to one they didn't accept and it wasn't even a second thought to keep going to them anyway. Thank you for taking such good of her!!|The SMART Clinic is very professional and patient focused office. The staff is very cordial,  pleasant and are always concerned about making sure your concerns are addressed. I just love Dr. Krull. She takes the time to listen to my issues and always gives me several options with details about what each one involves. I feel very confident in her treatments & recommendations.|I have been seeing Dr. Michael Jaffe for over 15 years for various problems(shoulder, hips, and back). His genuine concern for your comfort is why I trust him with my care. I was thrilled to find that he had transferred to The Smart Clinic! I just saw him today for an injection in my spine, and will continue to go to the Smart Clinic to be treated by Dr. Jaffe.|Both my husband and I have had experience with Dr G and his staff. Their willingness to help and solid knowledge has made such  a difference in our lives. Dr G's astute observation literally saved my husband's life.  He recognized my husband's cancer so early that he was able to avoid radiation or chemo.

If only10 stars were an option !|Worth noting: I am not a car accident/injury patient, so I have a bit of a different perspective than many of his patients.

Dr. Schramm is so smart, so caring, and truly embodies functional medicine. For those who are not aware, he has a board-certified neurosurgeon on staff, and he is not your typical chiropractic witch doctor. I almost never get adjusted in my visits--I get traction which has produced x-ray results that are as clear as day.

He blends traditional medicine with newer/more experimental techniques according to the patient's wishes. He also offers a lot more than traditional chiropractic services, such as medical weight loss and various conservative pain management methods.

Also Marisela at the front desk is the best!|My son and I started treatments at UIC several months ago after a car accident. I was very apprehensive about chiropractors in general because of a bad past experience. All the staff at UIC are so welcoming and knowledgable and guided me through the process. Dr Schramm is very thorough in obtaining imaging first to see what is going on inside the body, before adjusting or doing any kind of treatments. He explains each treatment in detail and genuinely cares about his patients. My son is a special needs kiddo and they have been extra flexible and accommodating for him and our schedule. I highly recommend this facility and the many treatments they offer.|Great place for healing. Dr. Schramm is dedicated to helping his patients recover from their injuries. I love the welcoming environment and professional attitude. Maricela is a very special assistant. I'm so glad I found this team|So thankful for UIC 
After being injured in my first car accident, I
had no idea how to navigate the situation. I found the Utah Injury Clinic and was scheduled the same day. At my first appointment, Dr. Schramm explained the entire process and conducted thorough assessments to understand my injuries. Dr. Schramm not only addressed each of my physical injuries but also emphasized the importance of recognizing the emotional impact of the accident. I was overwhelmed with emotions like anger, guilt, confusion, etc. It wasn't until my first appointment with Dr. Schramm that I realized these feelings are completely normal after a car accident. This reassurance was incredibly healing for me. I received three months of treatment for my back and neck injuries. Dr. Schramm has multiple forms of treatment for physical injuries and is constantly assessing your healing progress. He truly listens to how you are feeling and adjusts treatment accordingly. His chiropractic adjustments released a lot of pain/tension in my neck and back. The decompression machine has provided tremendous relief as well. The massage therapist was absolutely amazing. The receptionist Marisela was so friendly and always followed up to make sure I remembered my appointments. They really treat you like family here :)|Welcoming and calm atmosphere. Doctor Schramm was very thorough in determining which treatment would be appropriate for my neck injury. Highly recommend anyone needing PT to go.|Love my experience here and everyone that works here! My family and I have been coming to Dr. Schramm on and off since 2016 and he has taken care of my spouse and I after two separate car accidents. My recent car accident left me in a lot of pain and feeling hopeless. After seeing Dr. Schramm (Chiropractor), Dr. Li (Orthopedic), and Cerae (Massage Therapist) for about a month, my pain decreased and I felt more positive. They supported me in every step of my healing journey. Dr. Schramm worked with my accident lawyers and took care of everything. He went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of and my treatment was going well. Marisela (receptionist) was amazing in making sure I got all my appointments scheduled. I highly recommend UIC for any and all chiropractic needs and or pain management.|Dr. Schramm has being the first chiropractor that took an xray to see what needed to be treated.

I knew I needed treatment for my neck but, due to the intense pain I was already in, the thoughts of someone ""cranking"" or ""cracking"" my neck filled me with dread. Dr. Chapman's gentle, pain free technique has been life changing for me! Pain is no longer my constant companion. It's good to know someone's got my back now (literally!), whenever my spine needs a little reset.|Dr. Chapman is a gifted and caring practitioner. When I showed up I had been in chronic pain from cervical disk issues for months and it was only worsening. I also suspected I had sleep apnea, as well as severe TMJ issues and teeth grinding all my life.

The discovery process was fascinating and there's so much custom-made, state of the art equipment he's invented to precisely measure what's going on, and adjust you. After getting the custom-made equibite device fitted, my narrow airway doubled in size increasing my capacity to breathe, my TMJ pain has lessened a lot, and still improving, and the pain down my arm dropped from an 8/10 to a 1 over three days. I'm only a month into the treatment.

Had I not found the Lift Clinic, I'd have needed surgical intervention so that I could continue to work. And I'd still have bad, undiagnosed sleep apnea, which causes a whole host of other health problems that compound over time. Eventually I'd have found out and be tied to a CPAP machine every night.

Dr. Chapman is a life-saver and I feel very lucky to have found this place. My quality of life has significantly increased, and rapidly.

Also the assistants, Britt and Karlee are so caring and brighten my day every time. Everyone there cares and makes you feel like a VIP. I feel like I'm in really good hands.|Dr. Chapman has helped improve my quality of life immensely. I saw him at his previous location years ago. I could barely walk. I was using a cane. After a few visits I felt a lot less pain and was able to walk without a cane. I stopped going to him after several visits because I stayed aligned. I recently could tell that my neck was back out of alignment and got realigned and feel so much better. I highly recommend anybody that has neck pain, back pain, jaw pain, or pain that needs taken care of to schedule a consultation.

I can't thank him enough!!|This is a top tier institution to get either your bite or posture fixed as well as many other things I imagine they do. For me it was life changing. I can stand taller, correctly, my legs are no longer different sizes, my sciatica pain is gone, my scapula is forming back into place. For a non surgical procedure, magic is how I would describe it. The well oiled team at Lift Clinic under the direction of Dr. Chapman is not to be over looked. I want to reiterate that after I finished my instructions my body functioned the way it was supposed to. After seeing countless specialists, Dr. Chapman new exactly what to do.

Hit the second ball first and go to the lift clinic. you will not regret it!|Nearly two years ago, MY BROTHER came to the Lift Clinic. Chronically ill and desperate for help he paid Dr. Chapman $7,000. He did not have any improvement with his symptoms and is still disabled by his symptoms to this day. The Dr said he was an anomaly. There are no refunds. Buyer ABSOLUTELY beware. YOU ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO GET BETTER HERE. THIS IS CRIMINAL.|The Lift Clinic is extraordinary. Amazing staff. Exceptionally knowledgeable. My life hasn't been worth living for 15+years. One visit and my entire outlook on the future has changed. I feel the closest to normal me than I've been able to feel in decades. I've been able to change my abilities to perform normal daily activities and my duties to those I love. Life has been ridiculously challenging but now I can allow myself to have expectations of greater fulfillment of my life and life purposes. More energy, less obstacle. My friends noticed the difference immediately. My sweetheart has never really met me, normal me...til now.
Thank you, Dr.Chapman and your diligent staff. Living without 24hr headaches, nausea and vertigo; without constant neck pain is a 15 year miracle. I am so encouraged by your care and continued support. Thank you.|My TMJ was causing severe hearing loss. Other medical visits provided no help. My experience at Lift clinic has been wonderful. Dr Chapman is very thorough and professional. He explained every step of the treatment and was helpful in making adjustments . The entire staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I feel this has helped tremendously and that the procedure will ensure improved hearing and no morning headaches. I highly recommend the Lift clinic.
Joanne Fraser|If I could give higher than a 5 star rating, I would. I have been dealing with back and neck pain since 2015, with my symptoms in my upper cervical area getting more severe over the past year. I had went to a few other doctors who either gaslit me or wanted to prescribe me medication instead of searching for the root cause of my symptoms. I finally found Doctor Chapman, who finally looked further and was able to give me a diagnosis and treatment. I have been coming for about two months and I am as close to pain free as I have been in over a year. Doctor Chapman and his team are wonderful and they truly really care about their patients. They all go above and beyond. Going to The Lift Clinic has been the best decision I have made. I feel like I have my life back.

It seems they operate on the basis that you're guilty until proven innocent, which is beyond wrong. Both myself and my Primary made it quite clear that this appointment is just for a second opinion, no prescription expected, or required.
It is my fundamental right as a patient with the required referral, to be able to make an appointment with Dr Junkins and to be denied this and treated in such an inhumane manner by front desk staff is bordering on criminal.

Dr Casandra Mysior is awesome, her staff is awesome, professional and caring. I had a nerve block done and it was basically painless. The quality of care and service here is well above board. I was seeing a pain clinic here in Plattsburgh but had to go to Vermont to get proper care, and I'm telling you that I am glad I did. Don't wait for problems to get bad, transfer all of your pain needs to UVM pain management immediately. You will enjoy your appointments a lot more if you see the Drs at Tilley Drive, Burlington.|Dr Zhu made the process more confusing, raising her voice when I struggled to answer her questions (I am autistic and it's noted in my chart) and she misgendered me calling me ma'am (even tho it is noted on my chart I am transgender). I don't think she read anything in my chart except notes from a psych stay when I was suicidal during my Ehlers Danlos diagnosis odyssey because no one believed me. In her notes she wrote she checked the range of motion but didn't say of what, and she didn't check range of motion of anything. She touched me lightly on the back of my neck for 12 seconds and called that an exam and in the notes wrote she had a difficult time getting me to explain my pain. I switched to another provider at that place but I'm not holding my breath . Dr Zhu forgot the compassion part of medicine I guess. She just seemed angry and annoyed to be at work and too impatient for an anxious autistic patient to explain their issue.|I am extremely dissatisfied with this practice! My father is in terrible pain from peripheral neuropathy and was told 1 year ago that a spinal cord stimulator might really help him. We agreed and it has been a nightmare for a year just trying to get them to put in the trial. Absolutely unbelievable how uncaring this practice is about a patient's chronic pain. There is absolutely no sense of responsibility or urgency to manage my father's pain. To string an old man along for a year, promising him that he will get a spinal cord stimulator trial and then to cancel twice on him, is awful. Not only did they cancel, but they cancelled both times very close to the appointment. In fact, they confirmed 2 days prior and then cancelled the day before. The reason they gave was unacceptable. I would not recommend this practice to anyone. Very sad. I am giving one star because I cannot give zero stars to post this comment.|WOW, possibly the most useless doctor's appointment I've ever been to. I first started suffering from chronic pain four years ago, after a bout of serious depression. When I visited the pain clinic, they told me to come back when I had ""dealt with"" my psychological issues. When I arrived at my appointment yesterday (which I had to BEG them to give me--they apparently refuse to treat patients with psychiatric problems--discrimination, much?), and Dr. Brauner was rude and extremely dismissive from the moment he entered the room. He refused to do any diagnostics or other examinations, and he told me I should take so much Gabapentin (a relative of Xanax, that helps with neuropathic pain) that I was groggy/too tired, and then I would probably be in less pain. When I replied that I would rather look into treating the SOURCE of the pain, as opposed to numbing the pain, he literally said that he had no suggestions. He had absolutely no empathy or bedside manner. Incredible waste of time and money.
I would recommend the Mind-Body Medicine clinic instead, if you suffer from chronic pain and want an empathetic doctor who is actually knowledgable and willing to help find your cause and cure.|45mins on hold during mid afternoon on a Thursday is just ridiculously unacceptable.

After the first session some of my pain in my knee seemed like it was migrating at times to both hips, but after the second session it was already becoming clear that pain was greatly reduced throughout my knee and no further hip pain was present either. The third session brought much more widespread relief and I now speak of this non-surgical regenerative treatment as being practically miraculous!

The Burlington doctors and nurses are all better, and it's still in the UVM family.|I thought the hundreds of bad reviews was due to medication seekers being unhappy,but it is because this place is an awful mess!

Nurse Heather and her crew are awesome. I understand there are some that have problems with medication addiction, but it seems Brian doesn't hold that against his more trustworthy and honest patients. I have dealt with doctors that blame all patients for a few bad ones. In the long run I ended up leaving this pain clinic because the problem that I had to deal with to get the lack of pain relief wasn't worth it. I never got any real relief from the doctors here and as my pain went up their willingness to help went down. The threats to take medication away went above and beyond. My primary care doctor took over and now I am in tolerable pain and able to live my life.

I had some hard-to-diagnose tooth pain, and was being sent from one specialist to another.

Nebulous billing practices, overwhelmed staff and long wait times for appointments are just a few of the experiences to be had should you choose Dorset Street Dermatology.  The practice manager is combative responding to the most basic of questions in a adversarial manner with no interest in servicing clients. I am no longer able to trust in the services they offer and have happily gone elsewhere.|Amazing staff, super knowledgeable and friendly. Had to have a scar treated and everyone there made an effort to fully explain the procedure and make sure I was comfortable the whole time. Couldn't recommend them more!|Because of the high volume of patients, I had to wait to be seen for 6 months. Which is no fault to the office itself. However, once I was roomed, my appointment lasted about 10 minutes. I explained my medical situation to the  provider and she didn't seem to want to give me the time of day. She didn't answer the questions I had. The provider told me there was nothing I could do to in order to treat my pain. I'm now left with trying to get into other dermatologists and doctors in the area who are booked out months. I'm so sad that this happened because I thought I'd finally get some guidance on how to proceed with my treatment.|Experience with doctor was great after almost a year wait. Update - they processed payment and also sent me to collections. Said it was a miscommunication - Avoid this location.
Schedule and billing were well below par. Rescheduled multiple times due to Dr. being out, long re-schedule wait time (months). First billing is via text already saying balance overdue. I was very clear this was a preventive pre-cancerous screening visit, but was billed as a new patient specialist visit not preventive. They charge for free preventive services regardless of referral from my primary care doctor and preventive coverage from the insurance|The folks at DSD are great.  I have no complaints about my care there.  My negative review relates to their billing department.  They are THE WORST.  They constantly make mistakes, and they are nearly impossible to get on the phone.  There are always ridiculously long wait times (possibly due to the volume of mistakes they make).  If you use the option to leave a voicemail, they NEVER call back.  Based on this aggravating aspect of using this practice I would advise going somewhere else for your care.|I made an appointment for a full body check. I expected a thorough exam. The provider spent maybe 5 minutes on the exam. I have a ton of moles too. Maybe I just didn't know what to expect, but it did not feel comprehensive at all. My husband goes to another practice yearly and said his exams and very extensive. I will find another provider next time. This didn't seem right.|they seem to be competent Dermatologists. They did a skin check for me. However, business-wise, they leave something to be desired. They didn't send me an invoice for $25 and then tried to collect by email and called me a 1:20 in the morning. It seemed like a scam to me. I called and was told I owed just $25 (which I didnt know).|I truly cannot say enough good things about this practice. Kara is one of the best clinicians I have ever had- extremely kind, thorough, person-centered, and delivers the absolute highest quality of care. Sarah is also incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and immediately makes you feel at ease. I have never once felt rushed and my questions are always answered thoughtfully and with great care.

As a certified Regenexx affiliate, our practice specializes in non-surgical orthopedic treatments that harness the body's natural healing capabilities.

<p></p>

<p><p>At Vermont Regenerative Medicine, we utilize autologous cellular therapies derived from the patient's own body, including:</p></p>

<p><ul></p>
<p><li><b>Super Concentrated Platelets (SCP)</b> - Advanced platelet-rich plasma treatments</li></p>
<p><li><b>Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate</b> - Containing stem cells and growth factors</li></p>

<p></ul></p>

<p><p>All procedures are performed under precise image guidance using ultrasound or fluoroscopy (x-ray) to ensure accurate placement of therapeutic agents. This comprehensive approach allows us to target all involved structures including cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and nerves to stimulate genuine healing responses rather than temporary symptom relief.</p></p>

I would like to first start By saying National pain and spine the organization not the nurses or doctors are looking to do nothing but pad their pocket and are not interested in the best interest of their patients. National spine and pain discharged me because a day before I was to go to a regular appointment after being a patient of 5+ years they all of a sudden didn't accept my insurance any longer. This is what led me to. P. A. S. S. And was a GOD sent gift . From the first phone call, I made to get an appointment. They were courteous and kind and tentative to my needs and got me right in. The first visit was again amazing everyone was very kind willing to help willing to continue the care I was receiving, but also give many suggestions and ideas of a game plan for the future. The doctor was super knowledgeable very kind and took the time to speak with myself and my wife about what my future would hold and what other possibilities we could pursue. Insurance is always a battle with prior authorizations, and this office was above and beyond any medical organization I have ever dealt with when it came to my medication. I contacted them and they immediately pursued the issue took care of it and then contacted me to let me know it was resolved. This medical office reminds you of something of yesteryear they treat you as an individual with a name and not a number with a pocketbook. You will see some naysayers ""bad reviews"" but always remember there's two sides. . With that said Those of you with a  regiment of pain management understand what a tailspin this could have been but not With Pain and spine specialist Of Virginia they immediately got me on the schedule got me medication did bilateral ablations and also fine tuned my medication's and my lifestyle and I can now say I am living my most pain-free days of my life and to say I am satisfied is an understatement.

I came in for an Epidural Steroid Injection for lower back pain and sciatica.  Dr Wagoner was extremely prompt, took me in right away, asked how I was feeling. explained the upcoming procedure, and asked if I had any concerns or questions,  Dr. Wagoner was just so compassionate about the pain I suffer with, along with a very calming and caring demeanor, which set me at ease immediately,  His nurse Lisa was so very sweet and caring.  She prepped me for the procedure, and while Dr. Wagoner began the procedure, he told me step by step what he was about to do and Lisa rubbed my arm and shoulder to keep me calm and comfortable, the whole time.  I have been to many Doctors over the years throughout my pain journey, and I can't say enough good things about the level of care and compassion displayed by Dr. Wagoner and his nurse Lisa.  They truly have found their calling.  I absolutely recommend them and this practice for anyone suffering with pain.|I personally met Dr. Gershon when he performed an EMG testing procedure on my leg while also teaching two doctors in training. It is my personal opinion that Dr. Gershon is very intelligent, professional, and compassionate. The staff were patient and kind. The waiting room has a single huge rest room facility that is very handicap friendly. Large handicap friendly parking lot. The parking lot is immediately entranced from a very busy four lane highway with a median, which means a one way entrance and exit. Huge comfortable waiting room. Highly recommended.|I recently had 2 EMGs back-to-back that I wasn't looking forward to after my first one which was done elsewhere. The staff all told me that Dr Gershon is the pro at painless EMGs, so I went to my appointment anxious but optimistic. I'm incredibly happy to say that Dr Gershon lived up to the hype and both EMGs went by in a flash with at most a momentary discomfort in one sensitive area.

Not only did he succeed in a smooth and easy EMG, he was conversational, friendly, and took the time to talk me through the whole procedure and answer my questions. I didn't feel like just another patient coming through because Dr Gershon took an interest in my care and made sure I was all set during and after my procedure. My second EMG was the last appointment of the day and I'm sure all the staff were ready to leave, but neither he nor the rest of the staff rushed me.

I'm very particular about my health care and the providers that are a part of my care.
I would absolutely send anyone I know needing an EMG to Dr Gershon. If I ever need one again I also know just who I want to see for it.|The folks here listen, understand, know the body, and know simple remedies to seemingly complex bodily concerns and issues.  They are accurate without looking at surgery as alternatives are available and restorative.  I am grateful my internal medicine PCP referred me to them.|Terrible experience with this practice.

I have a particular condition that makes epidural shots more difficult to do. He discussed the whole procedure with me and answered all my questions.

He truly listens which is not easy to find. He also is very good at walking me thru any procedure he has done over the years. Thanks to his expertise I have made it all these years without having surgery. His staff is very nice as well. Highly recommend him!|As a registered nurse, I came to Dr. John M. Barsanti and LPN Mechole Rajab with a deep understanding of healthcare and trust in the system. Unfortunately, my experience with their care has been deeply disappointing and has caused significant, lasting harm.

A poorly administered injection and the lack of appropriate follow-up care left me in excruciating pain, to the point where I had to rely on a wheelchair for recovery. This was a profoundly difficult experience--both physically and emotionally--that could have been avoided with better attention, communication, and care.

What makes this even harder to accept is the apparent prioritization of insurance-driven decisions over genuine patient well-being. Despite my professional knowledge, I was left feeling dismissed and unsupported when I needed help the most.

I share this not to disparage but to advocate for change. Patients--especially those already vulnerable--deserve a standard of care that is compassionate, thorough, and responsive. I hope this review serves as a reminder of the significant impact healthcare providers have on their patients' lives.

If you are considering care here, I urge you to advocate strongly for yourself and seek providers who place your well-being at the center of their practice.|This practice has contacted my doctor saying they got a referral and they keep calling me to make an appointment. They have been told them multiple times that I don't have pain and don't want an appointment. I'm tired of waiting on hold to ask not to be called for an appointment. It looks like this is falling through the cracks. Surprisingly, they don't have an office manager. I hate leaving reviews like this but it is concerning how they are not able to handle something that should be simple...|Don't waste your time here they don't care about patients. They completely dismissed my wife's pain and refused to listen or do anything about it.|Dr. Rao and Dr. B are very pleasant Doctors I love their mannerism and patience, however their front desk staff could use some improvement and training ( given incorrect information) . I had an appt. With Dr.B, I arranged my appt. In Frederick I live 45 minutes away. ( that was the only facility to see Dr. B) . My son lives in Frederick so I made family arrangements to stay over night with his family) I called the day before while arriving in Frederick to get the correct address. I was told that I could not see my provider because my insurance no longer covered that facility. I was rescheduled for the Mt. Airey office 25 miles away from Fredrick( medicated)
I was given a prescription which was not at the pharmacies in Fredrick, which meant I had to drive 45 minutes to my pharmacy in Kensington Md, unfortunately the prescription was not covered by my insurance company. The receptionist told me that Dr. B wanted to speak with me tele-visit. I received a call to set up the tele-visit with a nurse practitioner who I had given instructions not to be treated by her.
Finally the receptionist and I came to the conclusion that I could wait for a different day, because the Dr. was not available. I was on hold waiting to be rescheduled, RAQUEL, COMES ON THE PHONE IN A RUDE, ABRUPT MANNER WITH AN AUTHORITATIVE AGGRESSIVE VOICE ""ESTHER THEIR ARE NO DOCTORS HERE FOR YOU TO SPEAK TO!""  as I was trying to explain myself RAQUEL was over talking me telling that I did not have a visit with Dr. B. Still as I am trying to speak  RAQUEL is still interrupting me tell me that   ""YOU scheduled with Orchid And why did you schedule with her if I did not want to see her""
I am still trying to explain myself so I asked to speak with Shelia the manager, RAQUEL responds by telling me "" NO YOU CAN TALK WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE THE MESSAGE TO SHEILA!"" I hung up the phone and called my favorite facility in Elkridge Md, Not once did Raquel identify herself as one of the assistant managers. I GUESS THIS IS THE TREATMENT YOU RECEIVE WHEN SOMEONE HAS  A TITLE ONLY ON THEIR JOB.  It does not call for one to be so RUDE ABRUPT AND DISRESPECTFUL TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING AND SOME WHO ARE IN SO MUCH PAIN THAT SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT WISH TO LIVE TO SEE  ANOTHER DAY BECAUSE OF AGONIZING PAIN. ( I HAVE THE SAME TRAINING AS RAQUEL WITH MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE, I AM A CMA, CMN/ geriatrics, CMT, and years of experience in private aide in Hospice) You  must show compassion and empathy towards humans who suffer with infirmities. YOU CALL FOR HELP BECAUSE YOU ARE IN PAIN, ONLY SUFFER MORE FROM THE ONES WHO ARE SUPPOSE TO BE HELPING YOU.
Finally I found out the Fredrick Md. office is supported by DR. Roa, Dr. B. and my insurance provider does cover both physicians at the facility.
2nd I did have a tete- visit with Dr. B to find alternative meds besides the ones that were denied by my insurance company.
So RAQUEL's poor attitude towards me only showed that she and the receptionist at the ROCKVILLE office made a HUGE MISTAKE which RAQUEL insisted that I was wrong ( or made to feel as if I was so F *** Up in the mind from drugs) THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.
There has to be a better way to receive help from a pain management facility.|I am not a patient but my father is. They were very thorough with any questions I had regarding his treatment and handled everything well. They're also ADA compliant to a higher extent than most hospitals we've entered, including most staff being generally informed about service dog access.|I had a great experience especially considering I was having the nerves in my spine altered. The nursing & technician staffs were helpful along with being very knowledgeable. The physician performing the procedure exhibited an aire of confidence & knowledge of his ability to provide the treatment necessary for the procedure to be successful. The physician kept me informed throughout the procedure   as to what I should be experiencing & encouraged me to definitely keep communications open with him during the surgery.
The post surgery work down was thorough with an explanation describing what I should expect over the next few weeks along with telephone numbers to use if something I might not expect occurs.
All in all it was very good experiences considering it was surgery on my back.

Thanks,
Richard Carter

Dr. Huffman took the time to answer our questions and seems to be genuinely interested in his patients. The staff is very warm and friendly. Altho I  have only been to the office twice, I  wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Huffman if you are looking for a pain management doctor.|I have now been a patient of Dr. Huffman for about six months.  He implanted a pain stimulator in me in early Nov '21 and he is now in the process of slowly getting my body used to tolerate the new drug (Dilaudid  or Hydromorphone).  He is very thorough with his explanations and seems to truly care about his patients, inquiring about you and your family to more fully assess your situation.  There is never the sense of hurry to get you 'out of there'.  I am impressed and satisfied with the care I am receiving and believe that if you are considering a pain stimulator that you will do well consulting with Dr. Huffman.|If you are looking for a Pain Management Specialist look no further! Interventional Pain and Regenerative Medicine Specialists of Virginia is the practice to go to and Dr Talal Ghazal is your guy! My husband has been in excruciating pain for over a week due to a recurring sciatic back pain episode. It was determined he needs an epidural injection but the specialist we went to can not administer an injection until the second week in June. Additionally, our son is getting married that week. My husband is managing his pain with pain medication and a muscle relaxer but can not wait this long. Our primary care physician recommended this group. We were scheduled for initial consultation yesterday. The staff is amazing! I initially called on Friday 5/13 and spoke to the medical assistant Kathy Tran. Kathy asked how my husband was and how I was. She said she knows that being a caregiver can take a toll. Wow!!! I made quite a few calls to other offices in search of someone who can help my husband. Not one person asked how my husband or I were doing. Kathy was pleasant and accommodating and responded promptly to all of my questions. She listened attentively and provided their fees, code numbers for insurance reimbursements, etc.  She even asked if my husband was on blood thinners as patients would have to stop blood thinner medications prior to the procedure (3 days in my husband case). Dr. Ghazal's office will submit a claim on our behalf. I shared the information with my husband that evening. They do not take insurance but after contacting the insurance and finding out the benefit coverage details, we decided it was worth it.  I called Saturday morning to schedule the appointment. The office manager Dalal Atef expected my call and knew my name. She asked how my husband was doing and congratulated us on the upcoming wedding. We were scheduled for Saturday, 5/14. YES!!! same day!!! The office manager Dalal Atef helped us understand what we needed to complete and/or provide prior to the appointment. Dr. Ghazal reviewed my husband medical records prior to our appointment . He took his time with us answering all of our questions during the initial consultation. He provided clear and easy to understand information. My husband will have the injection administered on 5/19. We have the utmost confidence in Dr. Ghazal and look forward to this Thursday. This is what patient care should look like!!! There are not enough words to describe how we feel about Dr. Ghazal. He really cares!!! The best saying to summarize our experience is:""In the absence of value, cost matters!"" This practice delivers an abundance of value!!!|I have been under Doctor Huffman's care for about 5 years now. For a short period of time when he started his new practice I was seeing some of the other Doctors at Holy Cross. What a difference! I didn't feel they heard my concerns so I looked high and low to find dr Huffman again.
Now I drive over 30 miles to see him each month because I know he cares about the pain I suffer with.

Linda Sivyer.|Dr Ghazal is amazing.  He listens to his patients, analyzes test results, uses physical exams, and his brilliant knowledge to address the problem.

I would recommend him to anyone.|I'ma sometimes  a professional patient at this point. In the last 3 years I've been hospitalized in ICU (3 days with very little chance of survival) and have been on visits to at least a dozen Doctors. This group is: Super Friendly and helpful from receptionist to Dr Spear. I have been treated great. Attended to. Listened to. Cared for. Excellent results. Thank You|Update again as the unnecessary childishness continues. I filled out a release for you to send my records to the new provider, back in January. Riddle me this, why have they not received them? Coincidence, I think not!

Update: God bless you for the boot! This is the FIRST time in my LIFE that I have achieved MIGRAINE FREE! Something y'all could have cared less about and shrugged your shoulders at! That never would have happened if I were still at this office. Interestingly enough, it took less than 6 months with competent providers to achieve. Sad for y'all and your patients.

Petty, indignant, children! You discharged me. That's fine, I've moved on, found new providers, receiving far superior care than I did here. Yet YOU continue to harass me. Sending letters when you know you are in the wrong but too arrogant to apologize. Now calling, non stop no less! It will STOP ASAP! Never in my life have I been subjected to psychotic immature behavior from a doctors office to this degree!

I received the letter, but theres a page missing. There is no apology for stating that y'all spent 6 weeks working on my PA, when what you sent, proves that you lied. Nevermind everything else y'all have lied about. I'm starting to see why y'all find integrity so offensive.

Patients BEWARE!!!! If you post an honest review about what actually happened at this office, they will discharge you from here immediately! All those glowing reviews suddenly make more sense, don't they?

First and most importantly! They care so much that they are willing to completely abandon patients! I was told before my appointment today that I would not be seen that I would have to pick up my medication and go elsewhere! Naturally, Angel changed her story when the subject of patient abandonment came up, but none the less, how better can you say ""I care"" than with patient abandonment?

Being discharged from this place is a blessing in disguise! Not one of them could care at ALL. When the office manager gets caught in her lies, she either backpeddles or denies what she said.

I find it all too funny that they are severely non communicative, then miraculously figure out how a phone works when you leave an honest review.

This was the discharge worthy post. . .
""Migraine for over a week now, and not one single
call has been returned! Not one! I'm over here just winging it, doing anything and everything I can to manage because they don't return calls. Their rebutted to not calling was that I called?????
I did get an argument and a useless script for a med that doesn't even work. I only got that much because I kept calling! Insanity!""

I was not rude, nasty, cussing, etc. I even asked what the preferred behavior, contact, etc, is when struggling with an intractable migraine. Once again they had no answer. I guess it's a blessing in disguse to be discharged from a practice that can't answer legitimate questions and concerns. It just validates their inability to communicate!

Over 10 years with Kristi Cartwight and the most she could muster up was an ""I don't know"" followed by a shoulder shrug. Not so much as a thanks for the business, piss off, nothing! Thanks for all the ""caring."" More importantly, thanks for showing your true colors!|DR Sears and  his staff are outstanding professionals.  For my treatment of  headache and neck pain.

Dr. Sohagia saw me for about 5 minutes, then prescribed me Lidocaine patches for my back (only one of my areas of severe pain), after I specifically told him that a) I already get them prescribed by my primary care doctor, and b) they don't help. Was told to get X-rays and come back in a month.

Went through the trouble of getting X-rays from Navy Medical, and a month later showed up to an appointment with them in hand, and spent roughly an hour in the waiting room for a scheduled appointment. The waiting room was filled with people that'd arrived earlier than I had. I have a child that I schedule a caretaker for so I can attend appointments like this, and cannot simply sit around for hours waiting to be seen... and also, I can't physically sit around for hours due to pain. You'd think that a pain management center could spring for something a little better than the cheapest, spine-crunching chairs for their waiting room out of a sense of general understanding for their patients. I had to leave without being seen due to severe pain.|Saw Dr. Sohagia today as a new patient , my first impression was great, his office is very nice and his staff is very kind , he is an excellent doctor as he explains everything very clearly and takes his time with you to answer any questions that you may have, this is why I believe he is a bit behind schedule is because he has that Personal touch and is not rushing you out the door like other doctors I have seen in the past I can honestly say I was impressed and will be sticking with him.|David was awesome!

I am a new patient. Check in lady with Blonde hair is very rude. Provider was excellent. However, I am extremely dissatisfied so far. It's been 4 days no prior authorization has been done. I only left one voicemail each day nicely but begging for a return call. No one has yet to call me back. I'm also using crutches as I'm in a leg cast. Today 12/23 at 11:25am we arrived and I made it inside and here's the blonde lady again. I was very friendly trying to explain that nobody will call me back and I really need my pain medicine . I made her aware we just drove an HOUR AND HALF to please speak to someone . She said oh they received your message and now you wait for a return call and walked away. Excuse me??? This is how you treat patients. I wish I could speak to Cooper NP (whose the best)  or the head physician there so they would know how I was just treated after driving so far from my home in Madison Heights. No empathy or compassion. She couldn't get someone to come speak to me on why it's been 4 days and not one return call nor my prior authorization has not been done. I'm going to go into withdrawal because of this. I also had cvs Caremark call them Friday and today - no one would answer per Caremark. Please can someone from this practice help me? This is so sad me being a new patient.|I am Now Writing This Review to Try to Explain What Occurred to Me at the Salem office. This Doctors Office Has an Answering Service Which is Not Doing Their Job, Bottom Line They Are Not Relaying the Messages. To Begin With I had an Appointment at the Roanoke Office, and Laura Davis Called in to Mark Off on The Day of My Appointment. The Answering Service Called Me On The Day of My Appointment at the Last Minute ( Matter of Fact I Was Headed Out the Door for the Appointment) I even Asked Them  If Laura was doing okay. I Also Told the Answering Service That I Was Out of Medicationin, She Informed Me to Call Back and I s Said Why Should I Do That When I Have You on the Phone Right Now. She Didn't Know What to Say. On That Day I Was Running a Little Late of Course You Can't Call, Because of the Answering Service. I Could Have Had an Emergency or an Accident, But I Can Not Reach This Office  Because of This Service. On That Day Arriving at the Salem Office I Tried to Explain My Situation However, They Did Not Want to Hear Anything I Had to Say. They Said That I was Argumentative and They Did Not Want to Hear Any of It. The Next Thing I know The Assistant Physician Came Out and She Threatened Me Very Badly and She was Very Unprofessional. She Said If You Don't Stop I will Kick You Out of the Practice. Wow! She Then Said You Are Lucky to Even Be See by Me today!, and  If I didn't Stop Talking I Would Not Be Seen. I Tried to Explain My Situation,But was Told to Take a Seat and to Be Quiet Until I Get Called Back for the Visit. The  Next Thing I know I'm giving a Urine Sample, I Then Walked Around Looking for Someone to Give It To. I Found The Assistant Physician That Was Rude to Me Earlier and Asked If She Wanted to Talk to Me, That I Had Some Issues That Was Happening to Me That  I Needed to Address. She Then Said  You Are Lucky I Even Seen You Today, and I Needed to Leave Right Now or I Will Get Kicked Out of the Practice. That Was Very Unprofessional and Uncalled For, I am Very Upset That This Office Treated Me the Way They Did On That Day. I Have Been a Patient for at Least 15 Years Now with Dr. Baylor, and Now I Received a Letter Saying I got Multiple Cancellations, Don't Forget That Laura Davis Canceled On Me the First Time and That Was Not Recorded Properly in the System as a Cancellation on the Providers Behalf. It Showed Canceled Only Meaning That It Looked Like I Canceled Both of the Appointments, Which I Did noMt. Now I don't Know What's Going to Happen, Because a Letter Was Mailed to Stating I No Longer Can Be Seen by This Practice. I was Prescribed Oxycodone by Dr Baylor I Guess They're Going to Let Me Withdraw From This Medication. I Don't Understand Any of It! This Answering Service Is a Waste of Time and Money. They are Not Doing Their Job, and I  Know What the Practice is Going Say:
That Patients Leave Multiple Messages, However Don't Put Me in That same Basket Talk lto Those Patients That Are Leaving Multiple Messages. This is the Only Doctor's Office That I'm Aware of That Has An Answering Service. It is Given the Practice a Double Black Eye! Meaning Not Only They Do Not Have the Time or Want to Talk to Their Patients On the phone, The Answering Service They Hired is Not Doing Their Job.( A waist of Money ).  I am Now at a Loss and I Don't Know What's Going to Happen. Has anybody Experienced This Situation? Please Let Me Know.|The nurses never smile and when I call one in particular has a bad attitude. She didn't even say goodbye to end our conversation, she just hung up on me. No professionalism at all. I wish my doctor would get new nurses.|They are the best they have been with me for 26 years and they have a heart of gold I miss him more then life and I love the whole office safe|I don't leave poor reviews off the cuff, but I've had enough with these people in this office. I've been coming here for over one year and can not take it anymore. The Christiansburg office is better, but Dr. Baylor is never there.
I'm not there for meds like many others. I need spinal, knee, and other injections. They are rude and condescending. Don't  question anyone, or you'll get an attitude and may be asked to leave if you're unhappy. You must arrive 30 minutes early just to wait up to an hour sometimes.
Today, after waiting 85 minutes to be called, the rude nurse asked a series of questions. One was if I had an infection. I said I have stuffy nose and may be allergy. I said I hope it's not an infection. She then said I can't have my procedure if I have an infection and need to reschedule. So apparently, she knows I have an infection because she's a doctor now??!  AND, Why not ask these questions upon arrival??  Why make me wait an hour and a half to find out I can't get my procedure? She would not even let me speak to the doctor!
Lesson learned... Next time, LIE.
I'm 20 miles from Salem AND require a driver in order to have these procedures. That's their rule. So, I need to inconvenience another person for my appointments. Understand?
They make it so difficult, and you feel like you need to kiss butt to get what you're paying for!!  They made so many people mad while I was waiting. I thought it was people who couldn't get the meds they wanted, but then they treated me like a dog as well!! They know they have no competition. That needs to change.
The place also smells like an ashtray. The nurse wasn't even friendly - at all. I tried so hard to like it here, but I really, really hate this place! STAY AWAY.|I found the place to be more about scribing medicines than solving the problems. They don't listen to their patients, I don't even think they care about their patients. All they care about is the money.

non-procedural visits. She's extremely caring, sensitive and nonjudgmental to me at every visit. I highly recommend her to help you through your journey.

Dr. A. Dragovich. He too, is kind and caring and listens to your concerns and needs. I trust him completely with my care.
The staff, from front to back are always welcoming, kind and compassionate, especially Sarah who works with Laura.
I do, however, have three complaints:
1) There is no way to get in touch with a real person if you need to; such as if you're running a few minutes late. However, they do return calls and messages through their internal messaging system promptly.
2) Their bathroom doors are extremely hard to open, especially if you are disabled. There should be an automatic door opener to accommodate those needing assistance; especially for those who wheelchair bound!!!!!!
3) PLEASE put coat/purse hangers in your bathroom. When you come alone for your appointment and are carrying your coat, purse and medications as needed for your appointment, there is NO WHERE in the restroom to put your things and I most certainly would not put them on the bathroom floor nor leave them in the lobby unattended!!|I went to the Salem office for my first visit.

Mrs Miller is great in trying to get answers to questions in person. But trying to call and talk to someone is remotely impossible.

She cares a lot and knows a lot of good resources and ways to help you manage your pain. Make no mistake though, this clinic focuses way more on pain and less on palliative. I went here under the impression that they had a more general scope and could help me cope with a wide variety of symptoms from my chronic health conditions. Tabitha kept saying she didn't specialize in those things and couldn't help with symptom management or connecting the dots between symptoms/conditions or anything like that. Finally I asked and she point blank told me this is basically just a pain management clinic. So, if you're looking for more general care, this probably isn't the place. But if you want pain management, this is a good place. She's really nice and does things like hook you up with paperwork for obtaining a medical marijuana card, she can fill out paperwork for disabled parking placards, she can fill out disability paperwork if you need workplace exemptions or accommodations. They're very efficient with that.|Tabitha has been nothing short of a miracle worker for me , after a botched back surgery that has left several issues.

Since going with him I have been able to control my pain to a level of leading a normal life and activity schedule. I highly recommend seeing Dr. Bhatia for any pain issues. In addition to being a great pain doctor, I always reach out to him for advice on other medical issues and get great answers.|I had an epidural steroid injection with Dr. Bhatia last week and it has definitely helped.  My pain level is noticeably less.  Dr, Bhatia is incredibly good at what he does - knowledgeable and very good at explaining what he's doing, has great patient rapport, and wastes no time in accomplishing his task.  He is always on time with his appointments, as well - something I really appreciate.  I highly, highly recommend him!|So grateful to have found him!! Dr.Bhatia is such a kind and intelligent person! He listens and provides constructive feedback and offers several creative solutions to managing pain in every day-to-day life :) He has helped both me and a few members of my family as well, and I would recommend him to anyone struggling with chronic pain. He's also very knowledgeable in spinal conditions, and helps explain things in laymans terms for those who struggle with medical jargon. His nurse Eugene has good bedside manner & his receptionist Emma is very kind and great with scheduling!

I was his patient for several  years  when he practiced in Reston and when I found out he opened his own practice in Sterling I followed. His knowledge, expertise and amazing connection to his patients is why I did not want to be treated by any other doctor.  He also practices the newest procedures and one I just became a happy recipient of is the Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy that he performed on my knee. I had received knee surgery that was successful but due to arthritis I was still experiencing pain.  Luckily, the procedure was painless, and I had positive results almost immediately.  I have gone from icing my knee several times a week  (sometimes several times a day) to only once since I had the procedure and then it was more for my knee feeling discomfort than actual pain.  I must warn that it was not covered by my insurance, but I found the cost to be very reasonable.  Also, for anyone who experiences pain knows, any procedure that is so effective and increases your quality of life is priceless.|Dr. Bhatia is great! He listened to my concerns, suggested a plan to address my issues, and, most of all, he gave me hope that he'll be able to help me with his positivity. Thank you!|I have been seeing Dr. Bhatia for many years now and he's amazing. He's so personable. Always asks about my family and how I'm doing personally. He also just doesn't ask about my neck issues but all other medical problems I may be experiencing. He's very through!|I was very happy with the personal attention and care that was shown to me.  The office environment was calm and comfortable.  I appreciated the small, non-corporate office.  Dr. Bhatia is not only extremely knowledgeable and caring, but he is practicing medicine the way it should be practiced, something hard to find these days.|I have been seeing Dr. Bhatia for many years. I have seen other pain management doctors prior to him so I can say that he is technically the best.  He also is compassionate and understanding. He listens to my concerns and answers questions thoroughly. I never feel rushed out the door like some other doctors. His staff is also courteous and helpful.  Most importantly, when I tell his scheduler that I'm in pain, I get to see him as quickly as possible.

Apparently despite giving my insurance cards at every visit, they weren't billed, my insurance has no record of services being requested, denied or approved. And I'm being harassed by collectors even though I never received a bill in the mail and never brought up at visits, didn't know my insurance wasn't billed or that i owed anything. Both i and a family member have been calling and leaving messages, but no answer and no calls back. I'm not sure I'll be able to find doctors as well as them but I can't keep dealing with this.|Dr. Siddiqui and his staff at Charlottesville Pain Management Center are AWESOME!  Everyone was courteous, I was promptly seen and examined by Dr. Siddiqui, the diagnosis and treatment plan were clearly discussed with me, and I received care (a cortisone injection) the same day!

Don't care, just want patient volume.|Dr. Messinger is fantastic. Bedside manner is awesome!  Taking the time to isolate the underlying cause of your pain and treating it really pays off. I highly recommend him and his staff. Nicole is always friendly and professional when calling in for medications and handling appointments.|I've been one time for an injection. Dr. Siddiqui was personable and professional. However, I'm extremely frustrated by the lack of communication from the staff. I left at least 3 messages before finally making my first appointment, which was scheduled for several weeks later. I've left two voicemails this week within business hours and have yet to be called back. The phone is rarely answered and I just expect not to be called back at this point.|Dr. Siddiqui is amazing.

Dr. Purvez is attentive in my care and treatments. His staff is also very nice, supportive, professional, and also very well put together. Since becoming a patient here, my pain has been much better managed! Highly recommend!|If you're looking for pain relief, DO NOT see Dr. Purvez. Now that I have discovered how much LESS painful nerve ablations can be since I've had them done with a different physician, I want to spare everyone the torture that I experienced with Dr. Purvez.

I have had chronic lower back pain for most of my adult life and it was at its worst after I gave birth to my first child. I was referred to Dr. Purvez who suggested nerve ablations. I waited for the nerve ablation testing. The tests went fine and so I was scheduled for my first ablation a few weeks later.

Dr. Purvez would not perform bilateral nerve ablations. He prefers to have patients come in at seperate appointments for the left and right sides of the back. I didn't question this at the time because I assumed it was standard practice, but in fact it is not. Other physicians will do both sides at the same visit. I assume Dr. Purvez chooses not to do this because he can bill more.

The first nerve ablation on the right side was incredibly painful. Not just because of the needles, but because I could feel the complete burning sensation of the nerves being destroyed for the whole 90 seconds running down my back to my legs. I cried out in pain and was ignored. I had tears in my eyes as I hobbled out of the room to get dressed and go home. He said I was ok to drive, but I definitely was not because I was in so much pain. The excruciating burning pain lasted over 24 hours and was so unbearable that all I could do was lie in bed and try to be completely still which was very difficult when I had an infant at home.

Then, I had to come back a few weeks later and experience the pain all over again. When I was on the table, Dr. Purvez barely spoke to me, not even asking if I was comfortable or ok. He mostly talked to his assistant. It was like I wasn't there.

However, once 24-48 had passed since the procedure I felt so much better. I was pain free for the first time in a long time. So I made the assumption that nerve ablations are just really excruciating but it's worth it to get the lasting relief. I came back a year later and did it all over again.

He would make off color comments during my visits. I was having my vitals taken by a nursing assistant and telling her how I was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea and was getting a CPAP machine. He said that the only thing I needed to cure my sleep apnea was to lose weight. Update: I am now in normal BMI range and I still have sleep apnea.

The final straw came when I went back for nerve ablations after the birth of my second child. I went in for the right side ablation, but something went wrong. The nerves were damaged but not completely destroyed, and as a result I was disabled for about a month, unable to sit up to get out of bed, drive, or bend at all without intense, blinding white hot pain that nearly made me pass out. I called his office to tell him this, and he prescribed me a muscle relaxer. It didn't help. He then suggested physical therapy, but I was unable to even get on the table for them to take measurements or perform any exercise. I called his office and said I can't live like this what else can be done? He refused to prescribe me any pain medication and said if I was in that much pain I should go to the ER. Which I did. I had to go a few times that month because he was ignoring me.

I finally worked up the nerve to get nerve ablations with another doctor last week. This doctor engaged with me during the entire bilateral procedure. He made sure I was comfortable and explained every step. He tested the intensity of the radio frequency running through each needle BEFORE starting the 90 second procedure which was something Dr. Purvez NEVER did. As a result, I felt NOTHING during the entire 90 seconds.  I felt nothing after the procedure either, even though I was expecting for the pain to creep up later on and put me out of commission. It didn't.

Don't make the same mistake I did and let yourself be tortured by this man. You don't have to suffer to get relief.|Dr. Purvez and his staff are hands down the best!  Personal, caring, and attentive - I've been seeing him for over 10 years. I hope he never retires!|I have had the best experience today for my personal back ablations.

I was in tears for days after I went in for injections. A different doctor told me my test results a month later. Dr. Purvez knew how bad my pain was and NO he didn't help nor did he care.

I started going there as a wheelchair bound 4th grader who doctor's refused to treat my chronic leg pain any further. Dr Goldstein and his team changed my life. As a 4th grader, Goldstein took on the challenge of implanting a pain pump. After several years of constantly tweaking and trying new meds, Goldstein was able to get me to no longer be wheelchair bound. That was 2004. I still drive from northern Virginia to Charlottesville (1.5 hours each way) every 3-4 weeks to have my pump refilled. Going to the clinic is ""home away from home"" for me.

I'm gonna deal with it myself! Bhavana Yalamuru totally lied when she put the information into my medical records! The nurse even acknowledged that she was shielding what she injected into me after I objected to my treatment. UVA refuses to talk to me!|The staff at the front desk are lovely! I saw Ann Murray who was very empathetic and caring. I have nothing negative to say about the staff, but I'm very disappointed regarding the practice's knowledge with pregnancy. This is my second pregnancy. I have an autoimmune issue, cause unknown, that causes me to have very severe, 6 week long, continuous  headaches during pregnancy and post partum. I have a midwife, so she's unable to prescribe anything for me. I was sent to high risk OB and my case was above and beyond what OB could handle. I went to pain management thinking that being specialists in pain management they would know how to treat me. They did not at all. I now have to go back to the high risk OB who said he couldn't help me to see if he will approve a medication being recommended by my midwife. If he does, they will prescribe it. If he doesn't, I'm back on the wheel of seeing specialist after specialist and being denied care due to being pregnant. I have been to 2 EDs, a prompt care, seen ENT, neurology, 2 primary care offices, pain management, internal medicine, high risk OB, a naturopathic doctor, a chiropractor, and I cannot get help. It's very disappointing that people who specialize in pain management have no knowledge on how to manage pain in pregnant people. There's a reason why the US has the highest mother mortality rate of any developed country. You are all but denied medical care if you're pregnant in this country, and this office was no different.|one star because initial consultation seemed reasonable. Procedure recommended and understood I had to drive myself. No sedating drugs to be used. Not needed. MD, DO, and med student heard the conversation. Procedure scheduled. Get ""nurse"" call who asked about driver. I said MD and I discussed it and worked out. Arrive for procedure. RN checking me in gruff, forceful, asked about driver-me and MD said OK, accused me twice of lying about that. MD did note it in record. Then MD told me the conversation never happened because he failed to record it. And somehow this was my fault. Then accused me of lying about how my prior pain management physician handled the same procedure. I drove myself to and from. Then MD insulted my profession, me professionally, and my employer. I am a highly educated and trained medical profession who does not care for humans. In a 2-3 min time period I was accused of lying by 2 people 5 times and had my career insulted. My 0-10 anger meter was at a 15 and they did not see the half of it. I made sure all the other patients in the area knew I was being accused of lying to cover the ineptitude of a MD not creating and accurate and thorough record of a consultation. I learned better than than and live the ethics I committed to when I chose my profession. Everything gets recorded even it it records something than could cause me some challenge. Never has though because I recorded the discussion and ensured on an agreed understanding. Used 8 hours of leave, 8 hours of my time, waited 4 months to have the visit and then the procedure (not done), 100 miles of wear and tear on my vehicle, and half a tank of gas. Find a real medical practice with real, ethical physicians. It is like finding a unicorn, but the ones that do not take insurance (yes I will be paying out of pocket) have unicorn status.|I would not recommend this clinic if you are a chronic pain sufferer. While the support staff were extremely kind and helpful, the doctor was not. My long-term (16 years) pain issues were dismissed. I was offered nothing to reduce pain (meds, injections, any diagnostics to explore comorbid issues). As pain specialists, they see disabled people daily, and yet they refused to sign off on a disabled parking application, even a temporary one, despite my use of a wheelchair, because of my inability to walk. They had no specific places they recommended for a surgical consult, no knowledge of other specialists of my condition. I watched as the doctor googled my condition and read off the name of the only doctor she found in the state, several hours from me.

I waited nearly 2 months to get in to see someone. My money and time were wasted by coming to this clinic. I wish I had never scheduled an appointment. I felt disrespected, condescended to, and dismissed. My quality of life remains poor, and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now.|I've been a patient at UVA Pain Management, Fontaine Research Park, for around 15 years. My first doctor was Dr. Kevin Vorenkamp. When he left for another medical organization (across the country) he referred me to Dr. Lynn Kohan. Both have been excellent. I live with extreme pain due to numerous musculoskeletal and health issues. Without them I'd never have been able to be an endurance cyclist for many years and avid hiker until too many major injuries caught up with me. While I await many surgeries of and on over many years, both doctors worked hard and extremely compassionately to oversee my care. The pain Management group has gone out of their way to assist with my pain care both pre and post op at my many surgeries. With pain management being squeezed by the dire opioid epidemic these doctors have carefully maintained to keep me safe with my needs for medications. Many other doctors, non-pain management, have failed to work with pain management and some have accused me of not needing the medications. It is taxing for any patient to constantly have to go through their long pain and medical histories with new doctors. It is especially difficult because while a patient is suffering from pain they just do not feel like rehashing those histories. It is exhausting and can very much bring a person down emotionally. Every person wants to feel good. Every person wants to feel well. People do not want to spend years and or lives in extreme pain. In my many years with this pain management group I've only ever had difficulties when I was wrongly scheduled with a Dr. Irwin at the Monticello location. I was misinformed about whether I needed a driver or to be accompanied and the staff treated me horribly. The doctor- a nurse informed me- made incorrect claims about what I was instructed. That nurse accused me of lying based on her conversation with the doctor. I've made it clear with the Fontaine office that I am not to ever be scheduled with Dr. Irwin or at the Monticello location and was told I am not the first person to complain of problems there. My advice is to stay with the Fontaine location. Their staff and doctors have always been excellent and incredibly respectful. They see you as a person and want to do the very best they are able to with the medical sciences available today. From being one of the first patients to receive new (to them) procedures to regular appointments and procedures over the years there are no egos just compassion, empathy and solid professionalism.|I don't understand why there are so many negative ratings about this place. Dr k o h a n and her assistant Brandi. These people saved my life. I have complex regional pain syndrome which is in the same category of pain as bone cancer. I also have another very rare neurological disorder called arachnoiditis which requires high doses of opioid pain medication. As long as everything is documented and you are not a drug seeker, they will help you. It also depends on who you talk to. I have had a couple of times where I've called and not received any response or help. Be patient and be your own best advocate. I am actually leaving the practice that I am at now because of the doctor missing so many days and has a record with a Medical Board of Virginia and pills started to become missing from my bottle so I will be waiting until December and hopefully switching over to them for that as well.|I had my experience there in 2012. I did several rounds of injections that failed then did MRI's because I told them I was still having pain & problems. They told me there was nothing wrong with my results and I was fine. Would'nt refer me to a pain clinic in my home town. I decided to go to my own PCP and have referral. Went to a pain clinic in my own home town and they found many things wrong with my MRI's.

My husband has MS and other heath issues and we left Kaiser and his insurance suggested this place  smh. He doesn't write for opioids and told my husband to go to er for withdrawal and to wait 2 weeks for his records. When I told him I was a nurse and that was not proper protocol he walked off and Stay away|Stay away unless you're on opioids!  This place is a joke, I wonder if he's a real doctor.  I went to see him since he was the only spine doctors in my network!

When I sent his office a form to complete for my insurance claim (not a motor vehicle claim) I was told that the doctor does not fill out forms!  OMG!  What a joke!  It took them only 4 weeks to tell me after I called 3 times and emailed twice.  Take my advice, stay away from this clown he's only a dope pusher!  He never even looked up at me the entire time I saw him on those 3 occasions!|Dr. Ghauri and his team have been working with me and my chronic health issues for over 4 years and I have never had a bad experience with them. Dr. Ghauri is kind and listens well. His team is considerate of me and my time.

There are procedures that are done in office, under sedation, which is extremely convenient.

God bless you and your family Doctor. Thank you so much for all you did for me.|I was so disappointed on how he treated myself and my situation. From the moment I walk in and the moment I walk out I realize how he was just interested in just charging the Insurance and that it. Not once he decided to help me when ever I ran out my medication 5 days sooner than the next refill. Finally I was able to go back to Mclean Pain Management where it all started. They did listen to me all the time and show me how much they care on my situation and always helped me every time I ran out of my medication if it was m5-8 days earlier due to my severe Pain. Every time I walked into Dr. Majid Ghauri office he was just is so much rush to get me out of his office. It was the worst 5-6 months and Painful time I went through at this clinic. I do value each Doctor because they have dedicated themselves to help others but I just never thought I was going to meet the wrong Doctor. I'm sorry but if you really need a clinic who looks after you and really cares about you even in those moments you see no way out I do really recommend Dr. Daniel Kendall from National Spine and Pain Management in McLean. Without any insurance and pain levels surpassing 10+, this clinic and their staff care more about their patients rather than charging right away over $485 to insurance. Good luck at Dr. Majid Ghauri clinic. Who knows, it might end up working great for you, but unfortunately it would be the last place I will ever go back.|This is the 1st place I have found down here since moving here several years ago that is actually good!!!

She is exceptionally talented, kind, CARING and she LISTENS to everything that I have to say. Most importantly, she always allows me to ask questions and give my thoughts and input into my plan of care.
I would never change from seeing her and have told many people about her and Blue Ridge Pain Management.
I have been to all their offices and the staff have always been courteous, respectful and polite.

Thank you all at Blue Ridge Pain Management.
K. Heim|My family and I just got treated extremely unprofessionally and disrespectfully by Dr. Baylor. The practice requires a driver. I was in the waiting room with my kids for my husband to get a steroid injection. I asked the rooming nurse if I could leave  to get gas, and he said yes. The nurse Jessica T came into the room and cussed my husband because she believed I had left to get gas. However, I never left. I was working on computer while my kids watched a movie in the waiting room. She called my husband an a-hole in front of the other nurses. The practice manager came in and said she would be repremended. She asked us to wait for one hour for the processure because Dr. Baylor was in a meeting. One hour later, they took my husband back to the procedure room to get him ready. Dr. Baylor came in and told my husband to leave, that there was too much drama with the driver situation, and for him to never come back again. When bringing up that nurse Jessica T called him a a-hole, Dr. Baylor says that maybe he is one. As they exit to the waiting room, my husband called him a name too, to which Dr. Baylor told him, in front of my kids, that he would grab my husband by the neck and throw him out. And I said to Dr. Baylor ""thank you for doing that in front of my kids"". This was a example of how healthcare professionals SHOULD NOT behave. Extremely unprofessional and disrespectful. If you have another option, don't go there.|PATHETIC sums it up!  If a doctor is afraid to write prescription for pain what good are they and why do they put themselves in the position to do so?  There was no pain management found at this hell hole!  My 83 year old Mother was treated very inhumanly by these people.
She had gone to a Spine and Pain doctor for numerous years for treatment for pain with no problems.  My Mother has had 7 back surgeries ,  a knee replacement surgery , a hammertoe surgery that wash botched and had to be redone.
It is very obvious just by looking that my Mother had severe chronic pain!
She had began to be afraid of the drives to her old pain doctor in Roanoke so in order to be closer we changed to Blue Ridge.   BIG MISTAKE!
My Mother medicine was cut.  Because of this she rain out approximately 5 days early.  Although there were other options that could have been used they chose to take my Mother off her medicine and put her on a suboxone like patch that she did not understand.
A pain pump would have been a more humane  option but was never offered to her.
She fretted and worried for days just constantly saying how much pain she was in and what was she going to do.
She could have been put in a treatment center to help her better manage her medicine. There were other options besides leaving her to suffer to the point that she took a bottle of over the counter sleeping pills.
My Mother is a hard working woman that began working at 14 and continued to work until her late 70's.
She truly was an advocate for the elderly generation and worked as a Med Tech for many years.
She did nothing to deserve the treatment she receive at Blue Ridge Pain Management!!!
If they want to punish someone they should punish all the young people that come in there and receive much more medicine and sell the medicine on the street.
I guess they like to pretend that this doesn't happen but I know people who appear to be in much less pain than my Mom and are given much more medicine.
The employees at Blue Ridge Pain Management showed very little compassion in managing my Mother's pain and I will never forget.
Run as fast as you can from this place!  I sure wish we would have!   They rate 0 stars for me !   My Mom was treated so unfairly there.  They also should be told that they have very thin walls and I heard the ""well, I guess i will go on in here"" remark made to her coworkers before entering my Mom's room.    My Mom had done nothing to this woman to deserve this comment and should receive an apology for the way she was treated.   I know that will never happen.  She will not even listen and return a phone call!

Why become a pain doctor if you just are going to cause more pain.
I will never get over the way they treated my Mom and I hope they never have to care for a parent with with the pain my Mom has!|My poor Dad has been treated like trash by an arrogant, egotistical ""doctor"" here. I would go as far to say he's discriminatory. This whole situation has turned into something that never should've taken place.. I've seen animals get better treatment than this. Sad!|I have only seen one of the ""Doctors"" at this ""medical facility"", if the rest are like him they are very arrogant, show no empathy, do not open ears and listen and are very egotistical.  I have found a new facility and am receiving proper/professional treatment along with some kindness at this new pain management center.
I do not recommend BRPM.|Remember that time Jordan Young told me nobody would take me seriously and that my case was ""laughable"" and now I have a number of serious conditions including cancer? Because I'll never forget. Have the day you deserve, Jordan.|Worst doctor's office I have ever been to. Extremely hard to make an appointment with (have to call, leave message, and wait for nurse to remember to call you back- took over a week, my surgeon's office even complained about them to me). Waiting room always standing room only. Disabled woman with a walker and in obvious distress asked for a chair and staff told her no, even though there were empty chairs in their office. Had an appointment, showed up on time, and they tried to extort money for an appointment they claimed I missed but would have never made. Refused to see me. Called office manager, then they agreed to see me but the nurse practitioner (who I've never met) refused to see me (she was running behind she said, so skipping me helped get her to lunch on time, no regards for my time, gas, or having to get and pay a sitter). Office staff was very rude. Other patients in the waiting room shared their horror stories and ridiculously long waits. At the visit where I did see the doctor, he was too busy chatting up the nurse about his Ebay purchase and weekend to even acknowledge me.  Both doctor and staff treated me and the others I saw like less than human. They don't value you or even pretend to have compassion because there is always someone else in pain they can get $ from. I don't usually have high standards for office staff, but this was just unacceptable. I can't recommend this office.|Love their new offices! Parking is great! No more quarter mile walk in the freezing wind and rain (in the winter) from the parking lot to the facility. Same friendly faces now just in different places!

For the amount of money I pay to be here every 3 months, I feel like he overstepped many boundaries and really put me off from even wanting to come back. I have an appointment in 2 weeks and I'm hoping I don't have to see him again, or if the office can make sure we don't get scheduled together. No doctor should make you feel like an addict but well rounded person at the same time. Disgusting...|I have been a patient of this practice for over 10 years. They have been a life saver for me. I have a bone disease that worsens with age. I have never been made to feel like a drug addict as with past pain clinics. I have gotten to a point of comfort with my current plan. My pain will never be completely gone, however it is currently manageable. The staff have always treated me with compassion and respect. I will miss Dr. Hansen. He has left us in good hands.|I have been with Pain Management for a long time. Started in Virginia and Portsmout, and to Norfolk. I never had any complaints. Never had a long wait. From the front staff to the back, they are fantastic. They understand that the pain is real. It took us along time to get me to a place we're the pain is manageable. Never free of pain, but have gotten me to a place of getting some of my life back. They have been there for me through many operations and illnesses. They are professional and personable. I recommend them highly . I always remind them that I appreciate them.  Thank you Complex Management Staff !|I have been a patient of Dr Holzers for decades and followed him when he joined Dr Hansen's practice. I have been so very happy with all the providers at this practice- Each of them have taken a personal interest in improving my overall health , quality of life and take the time to listen to my issues. I like the idea of seeing all the  providers in the office which gives me a unique prospective and input  of lots of individual experiences and knowledge of each of them.
I am a different person , doing the things I enjoy thanks to Dr. Hansen's Team of professionals!|i appreciate this practice so much! everyone is kind, understanding, and they listen to their patients. they are thorough yet forgiving if you make a mistake! the staff is so friendly & they respond within minutes, by way of e-mail and same day with voicemails. i'm so grateful to find this type of care with my diagnosis. every doctor seems to care about you not just as patients but as people! i would suggest anyone who's dealing with chronic pain/illness to come here. they will never force anything on you, they actually allow you to let them know what's best for you! you'd love it here!!!|I meet Dr Hansen over a year ago. I wasn't doing very good. Of coarse he had saw my records and of coarse same diagnostic nothing could be done medication to keep comfortable. In 2007 found out I had late stage 3 ovarian cancer i was given a yr and half that was with chemo. I have been on a operation table since 13 found had aggressive scoliosis that never is 25 with the surgeries. If all that wasn't enough 37 almost went 9 eye surgeries felt like some cut your eye out of your head, but I could see things never saw. Dr. Hanson the first day I meet you remember what I told you if I new I only had 15yrs left I give 7 or 8 never to hurt anymore. I broke bones and refused to take medication now I don't have a choice. What does your office do. Well if obvious and your receptionist made it clear my last couple visit. I sent you guys 3 or 4 emails letting know that I am in a bind that my car has been almost totaled and the shop fixing my car is a fraud. The old truck i had spend several 100 dollars and find out motor blown, against send emails explaining why I had to reschedule because I had no vehicle. Finally got there but only had 275.00 that got paid in 7 days could pay the balance.The receptionist told me she have to reschedule me takes me 2hr 15mins I called my church they paid  it for me. A week your office sends me a letter saying if I could afford to pay the 400 dollars they could refer to another clinic I WAS FLOORED I give to help others everyday had no idea you guys were so uncaring.  Act like it a sin my church helps me I give so much to help those in need. Recued 31 little puppies. Make 25 -30 trees for the kids hospital because my church helped made me feel like nothing .I come in my last visit Dr. Bowman  said something to me about being short a couple pills which I was not . Never FAILED A DRUG TEST. KNOWING I HAD NO WAY OF GETTING THERE NO VEHICLE.  NEEDED A DAY OR TWO TO GET THERE. Begged to go to hospital because 8,9 miles from my house take urine test or blood test. The clinic does drug test for high school elementary school. My pastor and my other friends out of town the other on a boat in ocean fisherman.  It's like you didn't care about me at all here I lost my last new vehicle, old truck quit. U knew I had no way to sell my trees that I been making the last  year just for Christmas. That your doctors thought of me as a bum because my church helped me. Even called that my friends that were helping me out. Amanda told to give permission left on 3 different lines. U guys tRefused to talk to my church. Told you guys looking at selling my house so i could get a car. I was so broken depressed still am my general doctor said i should report the clinic to the board lcould believe.  Then you STEAL 425 asked you to return

I not a person that sues but I can honestly say this  clinic has left me in alot of pain.They last couple month gave me Fentany in my char3/4ts causing labeled breathing sick as well nausea.  Begged you to call me and help me out. I still don't have a doctor and no medication. Please return the 400dollars. Amt least fill my medication my 2 refills of mnwhat i pd for Quit being so money hunger.because it's obviously shows how much you don't care. Only thing u made me feel very hurt. By the way Raliegh insurance commissions is taking my case. It could be months before I can get a car.|All the providers and staff are caring. If you are in pain, this is the place to be. They will listen and take you seriously. This office stands out by far from all the others. You can always get a call back the same day and I have been in so much pain there were times I needed a same day appointment and someone always fit me in. My quality of life is so much better now that I am under their care. I can't say enough good things about all of them.|I was so surprised how well everybody there listen to you. They let you explain how your body felt instead of them telling you. Everyone was so kind and understanding. I saw Dr Holzer 20 some years ago and then I moved from the area. It is worth my drive of four and a half hours to go to see these lovely people that really care about you. I highly recommend this practice to anyone having difficulties with chronic pain.

I have been going ro this facily for over 5 months now....everyone is lovely.
I know that sometimes we have days when there isn't enough staff but that isn't the patients fault...being on hold for 23 minutes is outrageous and then for a staff to say give me your # and they will call me back...first of all it 3:30 facility closes at 4..if you are short staffed and can't get to me in 30 minutes what confidence do I have that you will call back before you close.
Unfortunately I won't mention names but the front office staff could use some Customer service skills along with some etiquette when answering the phone and assisting patients...
When there is an issue with the portal don't blame the patient ask the office manager if there is something wrong..
I was sent an attachment 3 different times and i tried to open it on 3 different computers( iPad, cellphone and laptop) and it promted that there was an error on the portal end and being that it would be a HIPAA violation to send it to my unsecured email I  can't receive what I need to see the Dr.

Please train this manager to understand how insurance works. She refuses to even give me her name, that's entirely unprofessional.  The receptionist tried to explain it to the manager multiple times too. The manager screamed at me over the phone and was incredibly rude. I never want to return to this practice again.

He genuinely cares about his patients and wants to help them get better. I saw multiple doctors who just wanted to brush me off and give me injections. Dr Huffman diagnosed me and came up with a plan to help with my pain. After feeling dismissed by other doctors, it has been a breath of fresh air to be treated by him.|This was my very first appointment with Dr. Huffman; I felt like a human being again! He and his staff were truly kind and caring. He actively listened and welcomed my participation throughout the entire appointment. What impressed me more than anything was he did not jump to schedule a procedure, rather, he recommended a couple of future appointments.  He explained that the future appointments will allow us to get to know each other better and will provide additional time for any questions that may come to mind. Ultimately,  he will determine a long-term care plan that includes my input and involvement.
Being able to have  specific family members at this appointment was very important to me. Not only did Dr. Huffman address all questions and concerns they had, but he also took the time to understand the connection between myself and each family member in attendance. He treated them with courtesy and respect, which meant the world to me. My husband and I look forward to future appointments and continued communication with him and his staff to improve my quality of life. THANK YOU Dr. H and staff, you have given my world renewed hope.|Dr Huffman took time to explain both pros and cons of my treatment. Answered all of my questions and has my procedure scheduled very soon.|Very easy to speak with Doctor and his staff.  Think the doctor and I will be able to share information and not be too terrified to speak.  Liked the office very much.|Dr. Huffman has the best patient interaction.  He is patient and makes you feel heard.  He addresses each concern and adjusts treatment in accordance with your concerns.  Of all my doctors is my favorite.  My pain is manageable and decreased since see him.  His office staff is also super kind!!!|I've been working with Dr Huffman since 2017!
There is not another doctor that I believe in enough to inject medication directly into my spine and spinal nerves!

I have been a patient with Dr. Huffman since 2017, and look forward to many more! His caring and thoughtfulness towards his patients is unparalleled. I will recommend Dr. Huffman to anyone seeking pain management care!|My appointment with Dr. Huffman was exceptional.  He took a lot of time explaining the procedure, the surgery, the medical device and answered all our questions.  This was the best doctor visit I have had.

Founded with the mission to provide effective non-invasive pain relief, our center has established a reputation for delivering exceptional results without the use of needles or invasive procedures.

Ever since then I've suffered from headaches and back pain. Fast forward to 2020, these headaches turned into aura migraines. Anybody who has ever suffered from these migraines knows how terrifying and debilitating they can be. For years, I sought out help from every type of doctor pertaining to spine/brain health. I've tried everything from shots, nerve ablations, physical therapy, chiropractors, pain pills, etc. You name it, I've tried it with the utmost hope one of these doctors could fix me and bring quality back to my life. My last straw was a nerve ablation done on my neck and I suffered 3 aura migraines within 10 days after the procedure. With no hope and absolute misery, I dove deep into my condition as well as google and essentially stumbled upon Frank Gresham. After speaking to Frank over the phone, he convinced me to come see him in person and have him take a look at me. Within 15 minutes of examining me, he figured out that my left hip was legitimately lower or out of place in comparison to my right. He believed wholeheartedly that it was causing issues along my spine and muscles and was causing all of my pain/headaches. Basically, my body was working overtime trying to compensate for the damage that was caused by my hip being out of place. He devised a plan to fix me and get me back to healthy. God is my witness, his plan is working and working brilliantly. It's been a month and I have not even experienced a symptom or warning sign of a single headache. I've had some back and hip pain simply because my body is readjusting but other than that, I legitimately am feeling 100% better than I did prior to meeting Frank. I trust Frank more than any other doctor I have ever came across. He figured out the root cause of my health problems and is single handedly fixing them. If you are suffering from back pain, headaches, or whatever you may be suffering from. I strongly, strongly suggest at least speaking with Frank. The man is a godsend for me and I am so incredibly grateful for the guy. 10/10, I will never recommend any other person for headaches/back pain. Frank, if you read this, thank you so much for caring and figuring out what's going wrong and fixing it!|Frank Gresham is the absolute best!  I was referred to him by my nutritionist/coach whose other clients raved about Frank.  One visit for me and  I made an appointment for my husband.  Frank saved him from scheduling back surgery.  We had just about given up.  He was in such pain and could hardly walk.  We had tried everything -- cortisone shots, PT, massage, dry needling, you name it. ONE visit and we saw massive change.  A few visits later, he was walking regularly and no longer in debilitating pain.  We recommend him to anyone and everyone!   Frank Gresham is a delightful to work with and a wealth of knowledge.  He is a true gem!!!|I had struggled off and on with knee pain for years following an old femur fracture. I did a lot of PT and exercised regularly, but as soon as I tried to increase my workouts, my knee would fail and then the other knee would compensate and I would be set back for months. Last fall, this caused a quad strain and hamstring strain in addition to swollen knees. I was a bit miserable for nine months; radiographs showed arthritis in both knees and the doctor prescribed anti-inflammatories and possible steroid injections and to see the orthopedist. I didn't want that, so one day on a random internet search I came across Frank and scheduled an appointment. Oh my gosh! Within three visits, my knee pain was almost nothing and the quad pain vanished. The swelling in my knees disappeared. I have not taken any anti-inflammatories. It's been a month and still no swelling. I'm excited to get my old life back! Frank is amazing and kind. If you have something that's holding you back, call Frank! I am most grateful for his expert care. Thank you Frank!|Frank has insight and experience apart from any healthcare provider I've ever seen in my 69 years.. In 3 visit, not only is my pain and discomfort gone but my energy and vitality have me feeling like I'm many years younger.
Thank you Frank|I have been living with tendinitis in my ankle for at least five years. I have worn orthotics, casts, and boots to help relieve the pain. I iced it, elevated it, put pain reliever on it... I tried everything i could think of. I had 28 (!) sessions of physical therapy, and it did nothing. I was considering surgery as a last resort. A friend recommended that I see Frank Gresham before having surgery. It was the best decision I ever made. I can walk pain-free for the first time in years!!! When I step out of bed in the morning and don't have pain, I rejoice! I still can't believe it. Frank is AMAZING! He's professional, listens carefully, and is kind. I highly recommend you give his office a call. You'll be so glad you did.|I have had chronic back pain since 2014.  I spent countless hours and thousands of dollars visiting spine centers and chiropractors, but Frank resolved most of my pain in the first visit and all my pain in just four visits!  Frank identified what was causing my pain and made the necessary adjustments to correct the issues.  He also taught me how to stay pain free!  I would gladly pay all that I paid the others just for my first visit with Frank!  I no longer do I wake up wondering how bad my pain will be today because it's gone! Thanks so much Frank!|I have had chronic migraines for years. All the medication I was prescribed stopped working. I have seen Frank 5 times and the difference has been amazing. He is very kind, and helpful with great knowledge in this field. I'm so blessed to have this relief in my life.|I injured myself lifting too much weight, repeatedly. I couldn't move, I was just radiating pain. I was ready to go to the emergency room (which I avoid like the plague). Instead I remembered hearing about Frank Gresham the amazing trigger point specialist at the Chronic Pain Center. I set up an appointment and he gave me the full treatment! Turned out my hips were out of line and I walk incorrectly. After my first session, and some shoe adjustments I had some AMAZING relief! I went back for a second session 48 hours later and by that afternoon I felt like my old self again! I would recommend Frank Gresham to anyone with chronic or temporary pain, due to injury. This guy is Magic!

RE: Office Manager

I called today because I'm in great pain and my appointment wasn't until February 17th.
I was requesting for some medication until the 17th. At that time I was informed that I do not have an appointment on the 17th and the doctor wasn't available. I requested that the manager call me , since this person couldn't help me. He said that she would call me at 10am. I had to call three more times to get her to talk to me. She was never going to call me back. When I finally got her on the phone she was so nasty. I asked why someone didn't call me to reschedule and she said she left messages on both my home phone and cell phone. I checked both phones and there were NO messages from her. She was lying and CYA. It was a stupid lie because it is so easy to check out messages. Plus, if I got the message WHY wouldn't I call to reschedule??
I told her I was in great pain and it was difficult to walk and could I get some medication until my appointment. She said no I couldn't get any. (I have always been given medication before). But, she thinks she is in charge and makes medical decisions. She is not qualified to do that.

I have a card that has my date of the appointment. At that time she told me I had to wait until February 17th before Medicare would approve it. So today she gave me an appointment on February 11th. I tried to call again and left several more messages for her to call me to make sure my procedure would be covered by Medicare. She never called me back. Surprise!! Meanwhile, I'm in great pain and spend a lot of time in bed to get relief from the pain.
She could care less about their patients instead of helping them. She wouldn't let me talk to anyone else either. She is a lair, uncaring, and refuses to make any calls back to patients.

I would avoid dealing with her and she should be fired if this is the way she treats their patients . I'm talking about people's health and people in a lot of pain. She could care less !!  Hope someday Karma comes back to her so she can see how painful our situation is. She shouldn't be doing this job she has. Personally, I'd fire her if she was my employee.

So, bottom line is, if I didn't call today to get medication I would have gone to my appointment on the 17th that was canceled and never rescheduled because of her.  We are having a snowstorm on February 11th, so I asked her when the next appointment would be and she said March ! That's like a month away. This is all her fault and I'm paying for her incompetence.
My neurosurgeon told me if I fall I will not be able to get up and will do major injury to my spine. So, with the snowstorm I will be unable to make that appointment on the 11th.  I'm 79 years old and have a severe spinal condition. NO senior citizen should be treated this way. ! Plus put them under the stress she has caused me to have today.

I sure hope someone has compassion in that office to help me?

I also read the review before mine and it seems that person has the same issues with that office as I do.|I have had excruciating pain in my legs from my thighs down to my knees, and in my arms from my shoulders down to below my elbows, for months and this was diagnosed as being due to trapped nerves in my spine resulting from compaction of some of the discs between the vertebrae. After spinal injections, I feel as though I have gone back from being an old guy (which I am...) to being my younger self twenty or so years ago.

The injection procedure was essentially painless. Dr. Protopapas was reassuring before the procedure and said I would feel only some pinpricks when she gave me the initial local anesthetic and no pain when she gave me the shots. She was right. All I felt when she gave me the shots was a feeling of warmth, with some tingling, in the same parts of my legs that had been the source of real pain before the procedure.

The shots she gave me were in my lower spine and I was expecting to need additional injections in my upper spine to help with the pain in my arms. The better part of a week after the shots in my lower spine, I do not believe I need any more treatment as the pain in my shoulders and arms has also disappeared.

I could not be more pleased with the treatment I had at the National Spine and Pain Centers facility in Fair Oaks, VA, including the administrative staff and the medical staff.|Dr. P is the absolute best!  I have had nearly two decades of pain that other doctors have dismissed.  Dr. Protopapas and Dr. Van Zoeren were the first to take me seriously, order testing, and have me on a treatment plan that they carefully explained in detail so I know what to expect every step of the way.  Their respect for their patient's experiences is top notch.|Staff is accommodating and easy to schedule appointments and answer questions.

Front desk is difficult but do not give up. After you follow w front desk's requirements in 2 or 3 visits you insist to see the doctors who will treat you.
A real pain specialist MD physicians are the one for treatment. After initial evaluation by others.
I wrote one review few months ago.
I had great experience with Dr. Beverly Whittenburg, MD 7 years ago I persistently requested to see her.
Today I saw Dr. Whittenburg. The inside area of office is spacious and spotless clean.
I received 2 injections 6 hrs ago.
Every step was smooth, the physician and her assisstant both are kind caring and very thorough with their work. I am explained with detail instructions for self care by me at home.

Thank you Dr. W and Jamal - her assisstant. God bless you with healing hands to relieve sufferings of people who trust you. Love you.|Always professional and courteous. Seen within 5 or 10 minutes of checking in. Doctors and Physician Assistants do their best to find solutions to your health issues and are willing to listen and discuss various options. I would recommend to anyone seeking professional help with their pain management issues. They have done an excellent job of helping me to improve my situation. I'm not sure where I'd be without their help.|This review is for 8501 Prosperity Center reception only
I saw NP first visit was a good experience. NP said I will see Dr. Whittenburg at my next appt.
While in their office the reception made my second appt. date.
Because I had very good experience 7 years ago with Dr. Beverly Whittenburg and ex-Team in previous office I like to see her again. This new location and new team concerns me. Because after receiving a text confirming a reminder for my second appt. I called the office to check if they receive my Xray, MRI results. The reception said ""Good you call because your appt. is move further. Reason.. the doctor has full schedule that day. You need to see NP for intake first"" I reminded NP did intake first time few weeks ago and told me I will see Dr. Beverly Whittenburg in my second visit. She insisted  only if I see NP again she will schedule me to see Dr. W only as courtesy. ?? I agreed to see NP again if I see Dr. Whittenburg same date after NP. She assured me that I will see Dr. Whittenburg after NP on the same date, may have to wait a little bit. I accepted
I got confirmation text again for second visit w NP no mention w same date appt w Dr. Whittenburg.
I called today to remind reception I will see both NP and MD same day. Both calls today to office were sent to announcements and when prompt to speak the phone was dropped twice. I am hoping on my second visit things will be better. I will update again.|The care team is top notch! They went above and beyond to help relieve my back pain and for that I am forever grateful. Dr. Whittenberg was extremely caring and made sure to do any and everything to help me. The manager of the facility as well did an amazing job getting me squared away. I would strongly recommend this facility.|I learned quickly that not all National Spine and Pain Centers are equal. I live in National Harbor and went to a location closer to me, only to leave and go to the Fairfax location. My Fairfax team are Stephanie Liu, PA and Beverly Whittenberg, MD. They engaged in active listening to determine the best possible plan to manage my chronic pain. The plan that was developed uses modalities.

There is an ease to everything at this practice. The scheduling is seamless. The front and back-end staff are very courteous.  They are easy to reach via the patient portal. The wait time in the waiting area is very reasonable. The waiting room and exam rooms are very nicely appointed. When it is time to get my epidural, Dr. Whittenberg and her tech put me completely at ease. I highly recommend the Fairfax location.|I recommend this practice without reservation. Brianna Benedetto provides friendly, excellent customer service always. One day she took the time to make calls to help expedite my Stat MRI appointment! So grateful!!|The staff at National Spine and Pain Center in Fairfax is great.  I have been a patient with Dr Whittenberg's team for over ten plus years.  I have seen many changes over those years, each with better and better improvements.  Her whole staff is friendly and knowledgeable, there was very little wait before being taken back to a treatment room, and then being seen by the Physicians Assistant, Stefanie.  Current symptoms were shared, A continued treatment plan was discussed, and prescriptions updated.

Last year, I moved from the NoVa area. I continue to drive over two hours in order to continue with Dr Whittenberg and the team. Their knowledge and care is important enough to me for me to continue to make this trip.  I can't recommend them enough!|Truly one of the best doctor's offices I've ever been to - every member of this practice is exemplary.  Dr. Whittenberg is exceptionally intelligent and compassionate and has come up with a long-term plan that has allowed me to live my life again with mostly minimal pain - this after years of crawling up stairs on my hands and knees to get around.  The entire staff is at the top of their league when it comes to patient/client satisfaction and care.

I go into Dr. Bakhits office to talk to him with My Mom as my witness. He tells me to go on the lowest dose patch to start. I asked him about the Tylenol #3's, he tells me to stay on them as he doesn't know if the patches will be strong enough. Then I go do my first UA and he cuts me off patches because I have Tylenol #3's in my system as I've been taking them for almost 4 years now. I ask to talk to him in a formal letter via their my chart and get no response from him and a message back from Meghan their office manager that she will forward my letter to Dr. Bakhit  Wednesday now and still no response from my Dr.the one that told me to stay on the Tylenol #3's.  I received a absolutely disrespectful call from a gal named Mahogany.  This has to be the most disrespectful and unprofessional call I've ever received in the medical field. So now they won't give me my pain meds because of their mistake and dishonesty. I have proof I messaged my primary care regarding me being put on
patches and talking to my care coordinator the same day I was put on these patches. This is not ok to treat a patient that did exactly what you told her to do. Please do better at keeping notes on what you tell patients to do as this is horrible treatment of a patient for something they were told to do with a witness as well. I asked the most straight forward question regarding taking the Tylenol #3's and now I'm being made out to be some horrible person. This blows my mind that a Dr can act this way. I've sent multiple people to this office as I had felt they were professional and would treat patients with respect. This nonsense they put me through is not ok on any level. How would they like to be treated the way they have treated me. This Dr. Should have made notes on what he asks his patients to do yet he didn't do that. Very hurtful to get treated in a manner that I did not deserve on any level as I did exactly what Dr. Bakhit had asked me to. Staff called and apologized for their mistake. I don't blame any of this on Dr Bakhit himself. But this Mahogany chic is so out of line and unprofessional.  She is a risk for your company in the way she handles herself. She could of given me 2 minutes to explain the situation.  She wouldn't let me talk at all and kept acting like she caught me in some nepharius act or something.  I follow the laws and follow what my Dr's ask of me and never deserved her disrespect regarding a mix up inside their office. There is a way to handle yourself when dealing with the public and this gal is way out of line every single time I've came in contact with her. Most of the staff at National spine and pain have been kind, caring and respectful except Mahogany.|I've been a patient for more than two years, during which I have seen: Dr. Bakhit, who is a caring and talented doctor and Katherine Duffy, who was also exceptional--very smart, very funny.
My health has definitely improved while under their care and I am grateful for that.|I especially like that the staff are all friendly. I usually get in and out without waiting. I have been seeing Dr Bakit for over 10 years. I am grateful for the service he provides.|This is a very unprofessional medical facility. My daughter saw Dr. Bakhit and I was in her appointment with her. Dr. Bakhit put her on pain patches. My daughter asked Dr. Bakhit if she was to continue with her Tylenol 3.  Dr. Bakhit said, "" By all means continue taking the Tylenol 3, because I don't  know if the patches will work for your pain. Next appointment she had to give a urine sample and of course the Tylenol showed up. She gets a call from his office the day before Thanksgiving. Mahogany is screaming at her and tells her they will not refill the patches, because she had Tylenol in her system. My daughter hands me her phone and the gal is screaming and will not listen, then hangs up. My daughter request a phone call from her doctor several  times, sent a request to the manager and has not heard from Dr. Bakhit at all. They have been very unprofessional  and disrespectful of her. They are treating her very poorly, when she has gone  there for several years. I could not recommend  this poorly, unprofessional office to anyone. I thought they were better than this.|From the front desk all thru the back; docs and nurses, these people are professional and very helpful...they will not bend the rules at all.

Dr.Kendall is absolutely fantastic and GREAT doctor! He did for me 6 injections overall.
But I am wondering why it takes SO long to schedule 1st office visit before scheduling with doctor Kendall when patient has referral for severe pain|As someone who has suffered from chronic pain in my entire life, I was so happy to finally find a center that was close to my home that offered the treatment that I feel comfortable with that is covered by insurance. I had great experiences with Sharon, the nurse practitioner, however that is where the positives in this review end as I have had such a miserable and dreadful experience with scheduling and billing.

From my understanding The way they enter insurance information is the practitioner provides their notes on the appointment and a different individuals enters their claim codes based on the notes. I was surprised to see that my bill involved a number of complex procedures on top of what I normally pay indicating I received double treatment even though nothing about my visit had changed. I immediately contacted the office when I saw the bill and was told they would contact the practitioner. Through countless back and forths, I was told a variety of excuses including the system was down, some people were on leave on the day of the call and that they were working on it. Eventually I went in for another appointment (three months after discovering the issue) and the matter was resolved...or so I thought. I received another bill from the same time, no changes. At this point it has been half a year and there was no resolution. I contacted the office manager immediately to let them know and did not hear back. I emailed weekly and still have not heard back. Yesterday, I received a bill indicating I would be sent to collections if I did not pay the bill. I attempted calling the office and was told Samantha (the office manager) was in and was just in a meeting but would call me back soon. No call ever happened.

This practice is incredibly unethical. They do not care for their patients and clearly have a lack of quality control. I would recommend a different NSPC as other offices have been more kind and attentive or I highly recommend NOT going to NSPC.|Dr Kendall is awesome!! His treatments are like no other!! Minimal discomfort and pain relief within hours.  He has taken care of me for nearly 3 years and has helped preserve my quality of life. Wonderful Doctor!!!

Lou|This review does not reflect the doctor as I have uet to see him but rather the facility.
I waited 2 months on a referral for an appt., made 10/24 for 12/20/24. I was called by staff 4 hours before the  appointment to cancel and  reschedule for 1/16/25 as the provider wasnt there today.. I politely tld her it was unacceptable as I am scheduled for a total hip replacement in February and need pain medicine. Anyone that's had total hip failure knows how painful it is.  She asked me to hold to see if the "" Doctor"" could see me today???? Huh??  Confusion because she just told me the provider wasn't there. A few minutes pass and another voice which I recognized but won't name asked if I could be helped and explained I was, she talked continously over me and she insisted to make the 116 appt because the doctor was out for 2 weeks??? Again confusion.  Turns out I would see a PA on my first visit as he, Dr. Basik doesn't see you until a second visit.   The PA on first visits  can't  right prescriptions because im not a Virginia resident?? The PA was out due to some kind of emergency,  understandable,  the Doctor knew in October he be out the 2 weeks. Given this  wouldn't there  be some sort of back up plan? So if I see the PA in January, I won't see the actual doctor until  mid to late February and by then won't need pain meds as I'll be recovering from hip surgery.  Poor way to run a practice or any organization or business.  Th facility was  chosen for me on referrals as it's closer to home rather driving to Hagerstown.

The latest procedures were the Via Disc. This treatment is used to supplement the tissue loss between each vertebrae. If you are a candidate for this type of treatment I recommend you consult with Dr Baksh. I had it done on my L1 - L5. I'm almost totally without pain free. I have to say I'm 90% pain free after 30 years.|My experience w this office is nothing short of amazing. I forget my appt time almost every month and bc they know this, they call me. They work around my demanding schedule and are always incredibly kind. Most doctors would have run from a complicated case like me, but he has been supportive, reminding me of what's important and gave me back of life. He is the GOAT, as is his office staff.|Dr. Baksh is always so kind.  Staff are so helpful.  Dr. Baksh does everything he can to find the source of your pain and treat it.  I have recommended him to a friend, and she has been very pleased with the care she has received.|Dr Baksh is great. I've seen him for almost 4 years and he's responsive and personable. He does a great job with pain management plans and has done multiple procedures to help alleviate my pain. I highly recommend seeing Dr.Baksh|I've been with Dr Baksh for nearly 5 yrs. Coming from Oklahoma in 2019, I had seen 3 other pain docs in this area, none of which would treat the pain I've lived with since 1995. Finally, I found my pain Prince! Dr Waheed Baksh. Granted, due to the epidemic of drug abuse, he is limited on how much he can treat a persons pain, he gives it his all to make sure we are managed the best he is allowed. I'm thankful to have him and his staff are great. I highly recommend his care.",2024-10-14|2024-12-20|2025-02-13|2019-03-27|2024-05-22|2024-05-22|2024-05-22|2024-05-29,5|1|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"10 a.m.|2 p.m.|11 a.m.",45.8|40.2|40,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Does this Dr take WV family health insurance","No. I just got denied treatment on the 13th because of that reason",short_wait_times|advanced_treatment_options|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ8Z6zgFQCyokRV87wBnitR5w,259

He is a breath of fresh air in a world full of doctors that don't listen to you and know your body better than you do. It is easy to get disenfranchised by a healthcare industry bottle necked by managed care bureaucracy that is less about managing your care and more about sabotaging your health and well-being.

Location:
This particular office, as I understand, they have many, is located in Woodbridge in the medical office building behind the Sentara Hospital on Opitz Boulevard. It is less than a mile from I-95. There is ample free, easy-to-access parking.

Staff:
I often find great doctors come with nightmarish staff. That is not the case at Advanced Spine and Pain (ASAP). Dr. Go's support staff - from the front desk clerk to his Medical Assistants - are all patient friendly, come with the patience of Job, and there to help and support you.

Now, to the Doctor:

Appointments/Access:
I cannot speak to any other doctor except Dr. Go. He is at the Woodbridge office every Friday and it is not difficult booking an appointment with him one to two weeks out. While he is in high demand, he works very hard, long hours.

Bedside Manner:
This man cares about his patients. It is reflected in everything he does and says. For this very reason, don't be surprised if he's running a little late getting to you. He takes his time with each patient. He wants to get to know you, the person - the person before the pain and the person with the pain. He does not shy away from difficult or challenging conversations or topics. He is well versed on the types of pain the human body experiences, particularly after it experiences trauma. Dr. Go positions himself as your partner in helping you return to a place where you can resume an active, normal lifestyle.

I cannot speak enough positive things about Dr. Go. I just wish that I found him sooner. I wish he were my doctor in every aspect. That's just how awesome he and his practice are to me.

So, why 4-stars and not 5 stars for a man that practically walks on water? This location does not conduct a full intake, collecting what I feel are critical vitals. During my first visit, the Medical Assistant didn't take my blood pressure! During that visit, after fawning over him, I offered the constructive feedback and I let him know I was disappointed. I've noticed since then, I now get my blood pressure taken, but uh... that's it.

They don't own a scale! Why is this so important to me? I don't own a scale at home, so when I do go to the doctor's office, I make it my intention to get professionally weighed, as I am on a weight loss journey. I can't get weighed here, because they don't own a scale, which is kind of crazy to me.

At any rate, Dr. Go, Dr. Lee, the moment you folks get a scale, this will become a 5-star review. For any person struggling with pain of any type, Dr. Go is who you've been looking for. Tell him I sent you!|Excellent place to receive quality care!!  Not rushed to make a decision for certain treatments!!  Professional, friendly, patient & kindly listens to patient!!  Thank you Dr. Lee & Staff!!|Great physician, friendly staff, on time. He also has several offices for convenience. Wonderful. Really appreciate how Dr. Lee listens to you. Treats you like want to have a choice and understand your treatment. He is a very empathetic specialist.  I have been seeing Dr Lee for 1 year now.|I've been a patient here for around 10 years. I've seen different physicians come and go over the years. I consider myself lucky because I have always have had terrific experiences. Presently I see nurse practioner Angela. She is always warm and caring and actually listens to my complaints and answers my questions. The staff is the same way and I'm always treated kindly and with respect. Thank you for helping me to work through my pain by trying different solutions over the years.|Was very good,bolts front desk so nicely and attention, and Dr Lee,always very good with the patient.|Excellent service at Advance Spine and Pain.  Been getting treated for my lower back and now my neck/upper back.  Feeling better. The Doctor is very good.|I have been going to Advanced Spine & Pain for a little over a year. I originally started going to the Woodbridge office, with Dr. Lee providing my care. He is amazing! He listens, which is extremely important when dealing with chronic pain. Because of traffic congestion, I ended up switching to the Fairfax office, and now see Dr. Go. I cannot recommend them enough. Both of them are extremely professional, very personable and easy to talk to, and came up with a plan of care with my input. Likewise with their office staff; they are professional, and return calls ASAP. I needed a pre authorization for a more involved procedure. Their staff was right on it. If you are looking for a practice that is just going to throw pain meds at you, then this is not the practice for you. If you want a practice that is going to ethically do everything in their power to help you, then this is the place to go to!!|Staff was knowledgeable, respectful, and listened to what I  said about my condition. I highly recommend Dr. Brian Lee and his 5 Star Receptionist who was doing it all the day I was there.

He is thoroughly knowledgeable, professional and courteous. He listens.   I have had three procedures by him and they have worked well.  The most assuring part of working with him, as well as IS&PP, is that they take it seriously when a patient calls and says he/she is in pain, and they try to work that person in asap - most times, the same day. I always feel welcomed and in good hands. Obviously, I recommend IS&PP highly.|Was seen promptly, treated well, procedure went smoothly and without pain.

Then my car was broken into last week while in the start of a month long trip and my purse, medications, and other personal belongings and electronics were stolen along with my medications. I of course made a police repair that I gave to DR. And he said ""it was your fault you should've been more responsible you shouldn't of taken all your medications with you"". Again, it was a month long trip ... Either way, he acted As if I can control criminals! He then refused to refill my stolen medications although my pharmacy and insurance said it shouldn't be a problem. So he chose to leave me to suffer 3 weeks from all my ailments plus the withdrawals of doing my narcotic medications abruptly. Not the actions of a caring Dr!!

He truly listens to you, and you can tell that he genuinely cares--and, that is not common these days (sadly). He is also very kind. I honestly cannot say enough good things about, Dr. Thakral. A -God send!|Very uncomfortable experience with doctor thakral to say the least - he acted very condescendingly towards me, showed little to no empathy and acted as if he'd rather die than *potentially* order an MRI - and like I was a junkie looking for pain meds for wanting a simple evaluation when I've never taken pain meds and have never had an injury before. Can't imagine what it's like for other patients with chronic pain and who consistently need pain meds. I also heard essentially the entirety of someone's visit because the sound blocking was nonexistent and he seemed to also be treated the same way. The nurse who did my intake was really nice but I could hear the others loudly gossiping in the hallway which seems to be a pattern based on other reviews  the review by the woman which mentions likely sexual harassment is also very uncomfortable.

I had seen multiple doctors in three different states with no relief. I was not taken seriously and even told it was all in my head. Dr. Dawson listened. It was the first time I didn't feel dismissed. After reviewing my MRI, he explained why I was in so much pain. I highly recommend Dr. Dawson and his staff. I never felt like just a number. He discussed all my treatment options and took the time to answer all my questions. I am back to living a normal life without being in chronic pain because of the knowledge, expertise, and compassion of Dr. Dawson and his team.|Dr Dawson is one of my favorite doctors.

They listen to what you have to say give you a direct answer and let you ask follow up questions. They don't cut you off to go to another patients.  Definitely a winning team! I would highly recommend!!|I had a great experience with Dr Dawson and the staff at TPMG. Been to a couple other facilities in the Tidewater area and this group here does it right. They answer your questions, follow up with you if needed, and make sure you are aware of everything that's going on. I did not just feel like a number to them, they made me feel like the pain I was having mattered. It's refreshing to find a place that cares enough to do things right.
Thanks Dr. Dawson and everyone at TPMG.|Dr. Dawson is a bright and caring physician whose approach to patient care is compassionate and reassuring. I've been very satisfied with the treatment I have received from Dr. Dawson and his staff.|Dr Dawson is spot on. Thats a good thing. Julie, and Danielle are down to earth and very thorough. I'm not crazy about the 3 appointments it take to get the work finished out.
1. consultation- makes sense
2. Procedure necessary
3. The follow up. I feel like this could be done through the office secretary or nurse via phone. I don't object to the fee. I object to the 150 mile round trip to say what could be
handled  over a phone call. Obviously Dr Dawson is bomb, that's why I drive so far, but as long as there are no complications, I  don't think I should have to physically be on the scene for this to be done.

They make it a pleasure to check in/out.|After seeing Dr Patel for extreme lower back pain for first 3 appointments I was reassigned to his Nurse Practitioner. She prescribed at least 6 different meds including 4 increasing dosages of fentanyl; none of which helped - this process took 5 months at which time she said there was absolutely nothing left they could do. Surgery wasn't possible. By chance I was advised to see orthopaedic surgeon which I did immediately. Had lumbar fusion done, which doctor said was routine, and 6 weeks later 99% of the pain was gone.

A young lady came up on the elevator withe me and I said something to her. She looked very sick and was very pale.  She said she has constant nausea. Anyway in the waiting room she had a bag to throw up in plus she was gagging looking uncomfortable.   I felt bad for her and the surrounding patients.  Since she must be a regular ongoing patient  -- that if her chart could be marked that when she checks in they can take her back and put her in a room. This would make for all involved a better comfortable scene.  Other patients were moving into other seats and I would say feeling trapped.    I'm sure she is an active patient because she was talking to the front desk employee  about her meds.   As I said above this is only a suggestion.  This would be good patient comforting care.

I've been coming to this practice for over two years, and they have been a lifesaver in many ways.  I've seen Salil quite a bit in 2024 after having major back surgeries and complications related to it. I've seen him or Dr. Protopapas more than 20 times in 2024 and 10 times in 2023. They are as good if they are better than advertised.

Dr. P is outstanding! The staff is excellent, and even though others have indicated in the reviews that it is nearly impossible to get them on the phone, it has gotten tremendously better.

Once you have appointments and have been in the practice for a while, it is easier than making the initial appointment. I did have a little help initially, as my referring doctor was close to Dr. P and her staff and was able to connect me more easily.

I'm thrilled with my progress since my initial visit, designed to help lengthen the time before needing back surgery. Based on what I saw from the initial appointments, nothing has changed, and the practice has been outstanding. The pain I experienced before seeing Dr. P has significantly dissipated, and I did not need to see Dr. P again after those November 2022 epidurals.

I highly recommend a visit here if you are in pain and looking for an alternative to surgery. Salil and Dr. P are outstanding in their work. The supporting office staff and techs, like Joseph, are exceptional in assisting Dr. P with her fluoroscopic epidural injections.|A few years ago, with chronic back pain and just low-grade shots offered by a Doctor from a large Group Practice, my chiro sent a referral to see Dr Protopapas and it was one of the best referrals to a Doctor I have ever received. Dr P and her staff are very accommodating and professional. She has an amazing reputation from her peers (as I found out later). Its not easy getting in to see her given how in demand she is but you first get in to see an Assistant and then if needed, you are scheduled in for anyone of several treatments after Imaging is provided. I still remember after my first imaging; she saw something I needed to check out with my PCP and I did.

Getting injections/treatments from her is as good an experience one can hope for given the circumstances. Her nurses (male and female) are very patient and prep you well answering questions. Dr P will also visit and explain/ask questions. Then she very patiently will proceed always asking how you are feeling and letting you know what is about to come (tip look away from the needles). Then when you are finished you are provided instructions and not allowed to leave unless you are feeling up to it.

Her current assistant Chris is awesome to deal with and very patient. He has really helped me out with procedures, prescriptions and medical advice.

The Front Office is great with Ana and I believe Greg the Manager who can also act as a nurse for procedures.

Located near Fair Oaks Hospital with great parking. Worth the drive from Ashburn to Fairfax.

Another tip. If you need PT, ask Dr P for a recommendation. She gave me one and my therapist is awesome.

Dr P's reports are very complete and other Doctors can quickly follow exactly want was done.

Strong recommendation for Dr P and her staff. They ROCK!!!!|Dr. Marina Protopapas has been my physician for 10+ years.

She walks you through every thing she is doing through the procedure.  Always checking how you are doing.  I am very thankful the PA  Amber at Dr. Silveri's office referred her to me.  Her NP Chris, is great.  Like Dr. P, he truly listens to you.
The staff in the front office is wonderful too.  I could not be more happy with everyone there.|My significant other and I were treated by Dr. P a few years ago. Immediately, we noticed significant improvement even before we left the office. Dr. P was very professional, while at the same time very personable. We felt very at ease with her and trusted her judgment in our treatment. Yes, the wait time is frustrating but well worth the wait. I would endure the wait again just to see her and receive treatment from her.|Dr. Protopappas is great...when you can get her. My first appointment was with her, but subsequent appointments were with a PA. I didn't mind that, though it seemed odd I didn't see the doctor again. When a new problem flared up about a year later, I made an appointment with Dr. Protopappas specifically, but again, I didn't see her, I only saw the PA. That was a little frustrating for me, because I wanted Dr. P's insight, specifically. But the PA was extremely competent and helpful, as were the staff. Just know that you may not have an appointment with the doctor you schedule with.|Dr. Protopapas has been wonderful for helping to treat my lumbar and cervical spine problems.

He thoroughly explains conditions and treatment options as well as going over past diagnostics. I am so grateful to have him as my pain management provider. I would 100% recommend them!|I have been to see Dr Gauthier several times in the past and yes the staff was far from being hospitable. I just had my appointment and I must say the atmosphere in the office was so different this time very pleasant. I was greeted at the window by a very sweet lady Bethany and it was very enjoyable and the rest of the staff was just as nice. Looks liked he revamped his staff and has some very nice people working there now.|10/10 I have gone for several appointments with Dr Gauthier and each time has been fantastic. He is a very thorough and patient doctor. Very detailed when he explained the procedure I needed to get and was patient with me when I needed breaks once getting the procedure. The medical assistants have been awesome as well (Chris was fantastic!) Very friendly and great at calming down or trying to make you comfortable. I'm glad I was referred here from tricare and look forward to coming back (just not looking forward to more procedures. )|Dr. Gauthier and his staff are awesome and very professional.  I have had 2 epidural steroid injections performed by Dr. Gauthier and each have been a great/pleasant experience.  First, the office values your time  - you are in and out of the office in no time - no waiting around.  Second, Dr. Gauthier is very pleasant and personable.  He talks you thru the entire procedure - step by step making you feel extremely comfortable.  He is very knowledge and truly cares about your health.  I highly recommend Chesapeake Bay Pain Medicine Center for their professionalism and knowledge.  I can't say enough good things about this office.|Having covid doesn't concerns them, both my husband and I were sick. We get it worse since we have underline conditions, we had 102.7 temperatures and we were very sick. We had an appointment which we were too sick to know what day it is so we missed the appointment. I called Monday after we got enough energy to function and called the office, the office manager which always rude said you should have called us on Saturday we had a voicemail, what does it matter if Saturday or Monday since you are getting the info on Monday. She says now he is not permitted to be scheduled as he missed the appointment. Don't go there they don't care about patients only money.|All staff were friendly, courteous and professional.  Dr Wood took the time to examine all aspects of my problems and then went over the treatment options.  So far good results from my injection.|I wish I didn't wait so long to schedule an appointment, because the experience at Chesapeake Bay Pain Med. and relief provided has been 100% worth every needle. I have found the staff to be very professional and friendly. They talk to you through your entire appointment to keep your mind off the procedure. My first experience, I was more nervous, but each experience after was so much easier knowing Doctor Gauthier was letting me know what was going on, what to expect, when to expect it, etc. Definitely helped me to relax and make the experience that much quicker and less painful than you might expect.|So I had my procedure today and as all of us we read the reviews prior to my first visit.   There are some amazing reviews and some really bad ones.   So here is my experience..

Yes, this office is 100% set up to process as many people as possible and watching the precision in which Doc and the entire staff executes is amazing.  In order for them to operate at max capacity they have a clockwork like system of efficiency that some people may see as cold but with that said.  Doc not only took care of me he went ABOVE AND BEYOND!  He explained everything to me and even went over alot if issues outside of the procedure such as diet, blood pressure, and general medical advice.
I was scared of this procedure but I never felt anything more than a pinch and Doc talked me through the entire process.  True professionals!

The saddest part of leaving the DMV was that I could no longer see Dr. Varma. She by far helped me with multiple pain issues, more than any other physician I've encountered.

She has Nps do the hard work and they report back to her to brief her, and come back in the room. They don't even have any NP responsibilities as far as working on their own. Couldn't you have a Registered Nurse do what they're doing? I mean the prescription isn't even written by the NP that did the appointment/ examination.... So how is that legal? I think any if not all of us would prefer the doctor performing these surgeries/procedures that we are put to sleep for, speak to us and go over the procedure thoroughly before we trust her to perform a procedure that has risks associated....

Sincerely Pam Mitchell|Not was I was expecting, I have metal in my entire spine and have been suffering with severe unbelievable pain since childhood and it's just gotten worse and I also need more back surgeries in the future. I was kicked out of the program and treated like a drug addict all because of my age. They said it was because I rescheduled 2 appointments but he made it clear he didn't want me taking pills because I'm younger. He dropped me and cut my pills off and I had to go through withdrawal on top of my severe pain I already have constantly. It's hard getting in a place that's actually helps and cares and I needed that but didn't get it. Imstill suffering and still searching for someone to help me with this excruciating pain I have 24/7.|I won't explain my condition publicly but, I will say Dr Lee and this entire practice are the kindest, most compassionate practice I have had the pleasure to be with in a while. Dr Lee is extremely educated and intellectual yet explains everything in terms you can understand. The staff are patient..,as I am slow to move and in pain at times..so not the cheeriest. Yet they are always kind and professional. I'd like to wish them a  Merry Christmas and God bless to them all. Thank you for all you do.|Dr Lee and his staff are great!  Takes the time to ask questions. Feels compassion about your pain.  Love that he let's his faith be involved in his practice. I would recommend Dr Lee to anyone!|Best Doctor and team.   Would be in pain without them.   So very thankful.|Dr. Lee and his staff are absolutely wonderful and have helped me greatly. I have had lower back issues for years and after many treatments, Dr. Lee felt that a spine stimulator was the answer. The spine stimulator was certainly the right call, as I have had less pain in the last year then I have had in many years. Also, a Doctor that prays with you is certainly in the right field and a great person in my book. Thank you for what you all do each day!!|My experience was amazing with friendly and very professional personnel. The appointment was right on time and the evaluation along with treatment was thorough and informative. Dr Lee's injection was absolutely painless and I was out of the treatment center in record time. Thank you Dr Lee and all of your wonderful staff.|I went to see Dr Lee due to chronic neck pain that was causing headaches...I had a headache everyday (miserable). I saw Dr Lee and he ordered some cervical spine X-rays. In the office he told me I might need an MRI. Which I did.
*The only negative thing I have to say about my experience is that when his office called me to let me know that I was scheduled for an MRI they left a message...on the wrong person's voice mail. So, I did not know until I got a letter from my insurance company that I had an MRI scheduled. they weren't very apologetic but whatever. I had the MRI and went back in to see Dr Lee.

I'm supposed to see Dr B, not the PA, within 6 months of being a patient and was only scheduled after I demanded it (approx 10 months) and said I was considering someplace else.  Then, when I finally just met her at my last appt, she said I should never have been a patient because Trigeminal Neuralgia was not her 'wheelhouse'.
Also,  while most of the staff  is pleasant, those in senior office positions are not. The office manager is defensive, rude, and unsympathetic which I, think, may just be a front for a lack of knowledge.
Seriously,  I would avoid if possible.|I had an orthopedic appointment in July 2024 and was sent for spinal injections. (This review was posted in January.) Since I have to tackle I95 and it took much longer than it should have to get there, I went to the Spine Institute the same day and paid out of pocket from my HSA for my injections (not a small amount!). I knew it would take 4-6 weeks for a reimbursement once my insurance covered it because I asked before I agreed to it. It's been over six months now and I STILL haven't received my reimbursement. Each time I've called, I've been told only that it is in process.

Late February update: Around five weeks  ago, shortly after I posted the review, a response was posted. As requested, I reached out to the office explain the situation. A few days later, I got an email that a reimbursement had been filed again. I waited one...two...three...four weeks, and no check came. I thought maybe it had gone back to the original method of payment, so I logged into my account. No again. So here I am, about to enter the last week of February, still waiting for my money back for service that the practice has been paid double for at this point. I can understand waiting until the end of the quarter for bookkeeping purposes, but I can think of no reasonable explanation for a delay this long, especially when I've called at least four times.|This is the worst ""medical facility"" I have ever been to. The staff is very rude at the reception desk, with the exception of one person. Dr. Butampani cares nothing about patients! When I was finally ""allowed"" to see her after two years, she came across as bombastic and arrogant. I was forced to yell back at her because she wanted to lie and get her point across about an invasive and risky procedure she was trying to push on me! I had to stand up and tell her she was ""very combative.""  I have never had to yell back at a doctor because no doctor has ever felt they could yell at me! Yes, I have an opinion, and I do my research. She came across as a ""big bully"" type who cares more about making money on procedures. Dr. Butampani was very flip, condescending, and obnoxious in Dec 2024. She was somewhat more contained Jan 28, 2025, because I took someone with me, knowing I was never returning to this place. It is your right to have someone present, without question, anyone reading this review. It is not okay for a medical practice to stress you out or lie to you or to question your genuine concerns about safety. All of the poor reviews I have read about this office staff and/or Dr. Butampani are TRUE! I have lived them! Dr. Butampani lied about the success rate of the procedure she was pushing on me and shrugged her shoulders last month and Jan 28, 2025, when I mentioned very serious risks! She is incompetant as a doctor, in my opinion! Her staff is emboldened by her,  who seemingly relishes conflict! I saw medical incompetence and ethical challenges in their worst forms! Dr. Budampati has zero empathy and a horrible bedside manor. I even questioned her credentials after we finally met because of her behavior. Upon leaving on Jan 28, the rudest of the desk persons violated HIPAA when she abruptly gave the person I was with my confidential medical documents, in which I requested copies before the appointment began. Passing my personal information off was that employees way of being dismissive, as usual. She saw that I was coming to their reception area. There may be other locations with better doctors and staff outside of this Shirlington/Arlington location. I will not be returning! All the best!|I went to this office for 4 years. I thought at the time they were doing a good job, but have since learned that they are lazy and don't give a crap about healing anyone. They misdiagnosed my torn labrum in my shoulder as frozen shoulder and the resulting PT made the problem worse as they were treating the wrong thing. I now have constant pain and limited mobility in my shoulder. For my back, I had been treated for pain management using drugs and quarterly steroid injections. As my back deteriorated (DDD) I asked if they could refer me to a surgeon, and was told that a surgeon could do nothing for me so don't bother. Well, guess what? I had a  successful lumbar fusion 5 months ago and was told by my surgeon that I was the 'perfect candidate' for this surgery. I wasted years of my life trusting this practice. The front office was always great, but Budampati, and the two PAs I saw regularly, lied to me and never really listened. I was in there monthly for 4 years. It's not like they didn't have the time to get to know my situation.|It's hard to function when you're in such pain and sometimes they wait too long to treat you.  Also hey don't prescribe effective medicine  to help relieve pain until you can be seen.  Be prepared for intense pain during treatment like injections to the nerve- wicked!  Need to be under to make it through the procedures.|Dr. Budampati and entire staff are professional, thorough and understanding!
I highly recommend this Office location in Arlington.|On Friday, July 26th I had an appointment with Dr. Butampani. Reported in fifteen minutes early, waited another thirty minutes and, when it looked like I wasn't going to see the doctor very soon, I re-scheduled.

Their billing is not the best- there have been times where they would bill me for things that they never submitted to my insurance and then threaten to send me to collections because I told them I would only pay for what my insurance didn't cover. Eventually they would catch up with themselves, but you can tell their billing could use some improvement.|Meredith Overstreet and Dr. Hassasian are great. Meredith is thorough, listens to concerns, answers questions, helps prioritize care time lines. Dr. Hassassian does the in-office injections and procedures. He talks yoy through them so you know what's going on and makes sure you're okay during the injection/procedure. The nurses and front office staff are amazing. This practice makes you feel like an individual person and not just a numbered patient on their schedule.|I,  monthly visit the center.  I absolutely adore MONICA.  She is the receptionist. She is efficient, well-organized, and charming. She brings continuity to the office.  I also love my nurse practitioner, MEREDITH..  She gives me good solutions to particular areas of my body that need help. I consider her my friend.  The rest of the staff are very nice and respectful.  The appointments are usually very quick.  I would say around 20 to 30 minutes which includes check-in, filling out your current pain status and reviewing your meds, seeing your nurse practitioner, and making another appointment.|These people are the WORST! The only time I've been treated even close to this baldly was when I was assaulted by a VA Dr! Not good for the medical component of the complex PTSD I've been diagnosed with.

They had failed to provide the referral a when the Dr said and even wrote on the referral it was time sensitive. When asked, they either hung up the phone or left me on hold until I had to attend to other responsibilities. I was hung up on 4 times today alone! They claimed I yelled at them, for the record, I did NOT yell at the staff. Then their corporate representative instructed me not to call the office after my multiple emails over months had all been ignored leaving me no other option but to call?!

All this is after the Dr lied to me during the 1st visit putting my career in jeopardy, and the NP was so rude on my 2nd visit she would neither let me answer her questions nor ask a question of my own.

All this has worsened my condition and increased the pain, anxiety, and PTSD.

Absolutely unacceptable!

If you value your heath, go anywhere else!

...unreal.|Excellent service.  Meredith listens and works cooperatively with me to find solutions.|This was my first time going to this location. I usually went to the Arlington location and then moved to Manassas. I cannot think of one bad thing about this practice. The front desk and nurses are very kind and respectful. Overall they seem happy to be doing their jobs! The doctor I met with had great bed side manners and was knowledgeable about all topics related to my issue. He was very direct and to the point, and set up a plan to figure out what is going on with my back. I highly recommend this location to anyone who is seeking help to manage or relieve their pain.|I had only one provider at the office that I felt listened to me and tried all that she could that was Merridith. The very last visit to the office I was seen by another PA she was extremely rude. I was having tremendous difficulty and as I was talking and explaining things to her she literally stood up and said I need to go to my next patient. We discussed no solutions, I was given no guidance she literally just walked out. So I asked my pcp to take over management of my neuropathy medication. Since I am now having EXTREME pain issues I need to schedule an appointment but I don't know where to schedule that I will feel heard and that they are trying to help.|Great and fantastic Manassas's treatment. The staff are welcoming and treat you like a person rather than a patient. You are treated Will and cared for as an individual, where everything is explained to you with easy of understanding with all procedures from beginning to end.

She was very helpful and very accommodating. They set up the atmosphere of peace in such a way eases off  any nervousness .|I was totally impressed with Dr. Wagoner. Although he squeezed me into an already full schedule, he didn't make me feel rushed. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure and encouraged me to ask any questions I might have. During the procedure, he could sense the pain I was experiencing and asked if it would help to take breaks during the injection. He didn't rush me through it.
I didnt leave a review right away because I wanted to be able to evaluate how effective the injection was. And now I can honestly say Dr. Wagoner did an excellent job. It was like magic. And so far, 3 1/2 weeks later, it's still helping!! It was well worth the temporary pain. (Which BTW was not the doctor's fault. Just want to make that point clear. And, I'm not doctor but I believe that the worse your condition is, the more pain the injection causes. Again, it's only temporary and well worth it in the long run!!)

I had been to three different doctors in the area and Dr G was the first one to correctly diagnose me. Dr Penske has done my steroid epidurals and procedures that followed but Dr. G and support staff have always stayed close by to ensure my treatment is top notch. I owe gaining my pain free life back to Dr. Gershon, I really do. I have recommended this clinic to multiple family, friends and colleagues in Hampton Roads, I'd give this practice 10 stars if I could !!! Thank you Gershon Pain Specialists, I can now play with my children again, workout again and live my life to fullest - thank you will never be enough !!|I have been seeing Dr. Gershon for an EMG to understand underlying causes of chronic pain and weakness.  He and his team did an excellent job of explaining the test, what to expect, and guiding me through it every step of the way.  They explained the results in a clear, easy-to-understand way without all the technical jargon. Dr. Gershon has a wonderful bedside manner and makes it a point to listen and understand any questions or concerns you have.  I greatly appreciate him!|Dr Gershon was a pleasant surprise
He walked me through everything before the test began. It was a lot less painful than I thought it would be. Barely a prick. Getting the results from him as we went was extremely comforting.
It was so delightful to hear him teaching/training a resident! Very educational! Love his method of training. The mutual respect between them was wonderful to see.
Everyone in the office was awesome!|I had the EMG/NCS  done for the second time and again it wasn't as bad as people say. Dr Gershon was completely professional and laid out exactly how the procedure was going to be and what the outcome was. I felt at ease during the entire appointment.|Lumbar epidural steroid injection to treat shooting pain hips and lower extremist. Dr Gershon discussed the procedure prior to the start and then during the procedure. After the procedure he reviewed the procedure,  what had been encountered and what to expect. This is my fourth lumbar epidural steroid injection treatment. The treatment provides me relief for nine to fifteen months.|I want to rate this place lower. Had an initial visit a week ago and was informed their doctor wasn't able to prescribe the pain meds I have been receiving from out of state (military) for the past 5 years now. I have been through this entire song and dance many times before and have shown everything required to establish care with meticulously kept records. After 8 knee surgeries and 20 years of living in chronic pain, I was fortunate enough to find a doctor who explored and carefully curated a combination of medications that helped me significantly. Unfortunately due to the Navy moving us around every couple of years, I am forced to establish care all over again.

Today, I was scheduled for a 14:00 appointment with a Dr. Pinsky and sat in a room ignored and forgotten about until 16:00. I left the room and expressed my displeasure and disgust with the front receptionist who couldn't care less.

Do not walk away from this place. Run away. They are highly incompetent, inept, and corrupt people who do not listen to their patients and demean them at every turn. Avoid this institution at all costs!|My preconception of pain management, based on the experience of others, was that they just prescribed pain killers because the ailment could not be treated.  That would not work for me and I almost did not go, but did because I wanted to keep an open mind so I did make the appointment.

Sarah Cullen NP came into the examining room fully prepared having already  reviewed my file, including the two-page memo that I wrote describing my experience to date.  She explained my condition much better than the knee doctor that referred me to Gershon Pain Specialists.  She proceeded with a thorough exam and came up with a non-narcotic course of treatment that included specialized physical therapy.

I highly recommend Gershon Pain Specialists and especially Sarah Cullen NP|Dr. Steven Gershon is an exemplary physician who combines superb professionalism with excellent personal skills.  His staff members are an impressive group.  The consults that I have had with Sarah Cullen, NP, have been most informative.

Having had an EMG exam on both legs and feet, I would like to convey to others that these tests amount to small pinpricks and are nothing which should create any anxiety.  Dr. Gershon administered these tests in such a manner that I was most comfortable.

Having been a Type II diabetic now for over ten years, I have come away from my meetings with Dr. Gershon and his staff with a renewed belief that I can far better reduce my A1c.  His suggestion of purchasing ""The Diabetes Code"" by Dr. Jason Fung on Amazon has the potential to be a real game changer in my life.

After a car accident left me two bulging discs, they both stepped in with a perfect combination of expertise and compassion. They gave me three trigger point injections and prescribed medications that made a tremendous difference in my recovery.

Throughout the entire process, they were not only professional but also incredibly kind and supportive, which helped ease my anxiety and gave me confidence in my treatment. Their efforts truly made a positive impact on my life, and I'm grateful to have had such dedicated doctors by my side.

Highly recommend them to anyone seeking quality care!|I have an upper cervical problem that went undiagnosed for 6 months until I saw Dr. Gordon. He did a great upper cervical medial branch block injection with no complications. I can't lay face down and he was very understanding and flexible that I needed to lay on my side for the procedure. I felt he was the first doctor to pay enough attention to realize how severe my issue is. He recommended me to 2 other doctors that specialize in treating my condition. So far they both have been great. My only complaint is the staff/call center can be really hard to work with as others have said. I definitely recommend Dr. Gordon though. In response to some other comments on here, my impression of him was that he's just a little quirky, but a very sweet guy and a good doctor.|I've been a patient of Dr. Gordan's off and on for a decade. He has always listened. He listens very well. I can't say this is true for all doctors. I think he should teach a course on bedside manner to medical students.

Dr. Gordan goes out of his ways to make uncomfortable procedures more pleasant. I trust Dr. Gordan and anyone on his staff as he had to approve hiring them.

He also never pressured me into any procedures or pushed anything on me that wasn't covered by insurance.

Frankly, some of these reviews are ridiculous. It's a busy clinic, but there are also pain emergencies. I've been that emergency who had to come in at a moment's notice, and Dr. Gordan made it happen. I don't mind waiting longer because I know they are efficient unless emergencies happen. I'm not sure you'll find that flexibility in all clinics, but you're welcome to try.

The office staff has always been caring, kind, compassionate, and efficient. The same is true for the Samantha and the technicians.

I wish I could give six stars, and I highly recommend this practice.|Always easy to schedule an appointment and procedure. They do require two separate appointments; you have to be seen before they can schedule the procedure, but that makes sense. And they were able to get me in for the procedure just 2 days later. Anyone that's ever had debilitating pain from a bulging disk/sciatica knows exactly how wonderful it is to be made pain free inside of 3 days. I'm so appreciative of this clinic and all the folks who work there.|yesterday was my first visit
with Dr Gordon. For many months and even recently
I have been in excruciating pain. Dr after doctor were not able to exactly pinpoint what was happening. Didn't seem to understand the immediacy. Dr Gordon was kind, understanding and Mafe sure I understood what he was saying to me. First time I felt that there is hope we will work this out this out. If you need an honest, and knowledgeable doctor  ,this is the place to come.|Dr. Gordon is the man I was looking for to take care of my back problems. He blocked the pain very well 5 years ago and I wanted to find him again. He had gone to other locations and he was the only one I would trust with my back. I found him and life is looking up.|I used Spine & Pain (S&P) for almost 2 years seeing Dr Gordon in North Arlington for a pain management. I have a spinal issue that cannot be fixed with surgery so I require long term pain management. THIS COMPANY IS NOT THE PLACE FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT, GO ELSEWHERE.

The practice is primarily focused on procedures that are not covered by insurance. They will try and sell you on expensive hocus-pocus procedures that have no proven results (there's a logical reason why insurance will not cover these type of procedures.)

I witnessed a very high employee turnover over primarily with physician assistant. Most visits will be scheduled with a PA so you will rarely see Dr Gordon.

Communication is almost impossible. If you have trouble with a script there will be no one to speak to. The phone chain will take 20 minutes to work thru and only get you to a foreign call center or vm. No after hour's service so you can expect to go days without vital medication if a problem arises.

Each office is essentially a franchise like McDonalds. No two offices are the same. S&P claim to follow the same policies but in the end they do whatever will earn the practice more money.

Most pain management centers will require in-person visits only every 3 month for pain management and will refill monthy during this period. S&P requires a in-person visit EVERY month even when you are only requiring a refill.

So if you value your time and your sanity do not use this company. Go to a reputable practice with a major heath care system like Inova or Medstar etc.|Dr. Gordon is the best!

He took the time to really understand the nature of my pain.  He explained all my treatments options clearly and answered all my questions.
I had previously seen him some years ago with positive results.
I highly recommend Dr Dade!|I have gone to National Spine & Pain Center for many years. The reason was to be seen by Dr. Wagner and his staff. He is very honest in telling you the best treatment for your issues whether that be as simple as physical therapy, PRP, or surgery. But 99% of the time, he can help you through methods other than surgery. I have told my friend that before you decide you need surgery, go see Dr. Wagner. Whenever I have to move out of the DC area, I will still travel to see Dr. Wagner for all my ""aches and pains"".|Dr Wagner is awesome ! I appreciate all his knowledge, professionalism , how he engages and listens ! His staff is awesome too !|I was scheduled to see a pain doctor but I met with his assistant who very rushed. The appointment lasted 15 minutes. She already assumed I needed another injection in my back. My primary care had sent them all my report in January. They were not knowledgeable about my condition. Driving two hours out of town for medical care was an absolute waste. I also confirmed if my insurance coverage will pay for all costs. However they are billing me  $38 for uncovered expenses. Their office billed $585 for this visit. No wonder health cost keep soaring.  This office is a waste of time!|Dr. Wagner really takes the time to listen and give me options without pushing a treatment on me.  He has helped me avoid several surgeries and heal naturally.  It's especially great to have a doctor who has personal experiences with the treatments.|My doctor with National Spine & Pain Centers (NSPC) retired so I wanted to explore all options for the future, especially those closer to McLean.  I like the organization's focus on nonsurgical alternatives to treating pain.  It was easy to have confidence with my prior Dr of many years, but with his retirement I wanted someone closer to home and work.

So I'd gone online, reviewing all nearby NSPC Drs and offices - their bios, treatments offered, insurance accepted, and all patient reviews, some multiple times. I narrowed to 3 good possibilities and decided to start with Dr Robert Wagner at the Tysons office.

It was an excellent choice.  I knew it as soon as Dr Wagner started the appt.  While it seems I am not a good candidate for his experimental treatments - the main focus for his office - I'm very impressed with his mastery of challenging surgical conditions. The benefits for some of his patients incude expediting their recovery from injuries. Amazing what can be done with stem cells!

Especially since we both knew from the outset that I would not be following up with his office, he was overly generous with his busy time - reviewing my imaging ordered by a different Dr, offering but not pushing his expert opinions.  He actively listened, giving his total attention, is personable, straightforward, and did not use jargon.
I'm a super fan of Dr Wagner after just one appt, hence the 5 stars.|I have seen A few Dr's from this practice and are all great!! A special shout out to Dr Wagner, he has been amazing . He is on a mission to help me and find the source of my pain . He is very kind, devoted, has my best interest at hand . Connie is also amazing at taking care of my needs! You can't go wrong with any Dr here|I received a referral from a doctor that I trust to visit this practice because of unexplained pain. Let me tell you! This practice exceeded my expectations and Dr. Wagner made me feel so understood. He listened (I talk a lot because I have a lot of complicated issues), he believed me, he took his time with me etc. I was thoroughly examined, my images e.g. MRIs, CTs, (lots of them) were thoroughly evaluated and I left the office feeling confident about my evaluation and care. Everyone in the office was professional, kind, helpful, understanding, caring etc. Overall I had an amazing experience at the National Spine & Pain Center in McLean VA.",2025-01-06|2019-08-11|2024-09-18|2023-04-10|2023-06-14|2022-10-20|2022-09-29|2021-07-02,5|5|5|2|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJl8hlm-tKtokR-dGz0YbYhaE,85

After filling out some paperwork, I sat waiting for only a few minutes, and they called me back to room 2 for a checkup. After only a few minutes of waiting the Doctor came in.   He was very polite and professional. He told me the procedure in detail and answered all of my questions.  I felt good when I left the building.  I feel like the Doctor will help me with my pain.   Very pleased with this office.|If you are reading these reviews because you are curious about how the new Doctor, Samuel Luebbert, is compared to Dr. Holland this is the one to read. Without going too much into my pain experience or treatment plans, here is the basics. My intake started with Dr. Holland and him providing me his opinion on what treatments would be best moving forward. I left that first initial appointment feeling like all my questions had been answered and that my doctor had a good understanding of what I was experiencing and how to best treat it. Unfortunately, Dr. Holland has since left and his replacement is Dr. Samuel Luebbert who has now taken over my treatment that Dr. Holland saw fit. I have had two appointments with this new doctor and after this second one I will not be returning to this specific national spine and pain center due to how he treated me within this appointment. There were just too many red flags with this doctor to where I do not feel comfortable seeking any further care. When he walked into my appointment room he started asking me about my neck pain which I do not experience at all, my pain is in both my shoulders expending to my elbows at times. Red flag: not reading the patient sheet/ having an understanding of what the patient is experiencing before walking through the door. He started arguing with me that he didn't have a good understanding because Dr. Holland did my intake to which I responded that he should then do an evaluation of me since he didn't seem to have a good idea of what I was experiencing. Did not want to. Red Flag. Went on to the care that I was there for which were trigger points and continued to not listen to where I needed my injections to give me the full effect I needed. Red flag. After my trigger point he wanted to make changes to my medication when I have been on these medications for almost 2 years and they are doing exactly what I need them to do. Additionally to that point, why would I take advice from a doctor that had no idea of my condition before even walking through the door or even following the instructions of how I have typically get my trigger points done. From the moment Dr. Luebbert walked in the door I felt as if Dr. Luebbert saw me and my care as something left behind by Dr. Holland and just wanted to get me out of the door as fast as possible. I spent more time in the waiting room than I did with this doctor which is a lot to say when so much went wrong. I left in tears after seeing Dr. Luebbert and when both receptionist heard my complaints they said I am not the only one who has left in tears after seeing this new doctor. This comment only drilled it in my head that I needed to find a new place of care and also ensure that multiple people of management knows that I am not the only person with this experience. I have never left any establishment feeling so awful that I needed to write a one star review and it really saddens me for this specific national spine and pain clinic because every other person I have interacted with besides Dr. Luebbert has been absolutely amazing. I spoke with the in house manager to place a formal complaint but no formal notes were taken which has lead me to reach out to HR. I want my experience to be a reference incase another patient has as awful an experience as I did. There needs to be documentation to show undeniable proof that this is a pattern with Dr. Luebbert so I will be the first to start.|Moved here from md a few months back and I've had the same care plan for my pain for 10 years. 3rd visit here after charging me my 80 dollar copay they inform me they no longer want to provide me the care I need. Oh and like other reviews have noted they don't seem to read a chart or anything before coming in. Asking me about lower back pain when all of my pain has always been in my upper back/shoulders. Doctor doesn't seem to want to hear anything you have to say and makes assumptions based on his experience. Being like <30 that isn't much.|READ THE BAD REVEIWS! I did not! I am deeply disappointed with my experience at National Spine and Pain Centers. Long story shortened. My journey began in 2023 when my lumbar pain severely limited my ability to walk and engage in daily activities. Desperate for relief, I sought treatment at their Fredericksburg office and scheduled a trial Radiofrequency Ablation procedure, which required two trial rounds for insurance approval. Unfortunately, Dr. Soteropoulos, who performed my first trial, was incredibly rude and dismissive. The procedure was excruciatingly painful, and his lack of empathy was shocking. I was never told about the excruciating pain of this procedure and how it works.

Hoping for a better experience, I transferred to the Charlottesville office, even though it meant restarting the trial procedures. I finally received some relief from Dr. Holland's treatment in January 2024, allowing me to enjoy activities like walking my dogs and visiting museums again. I couldn't believe how well the procedure worked! 70% of my pain was gone! However, by July 2024, the pain returned tenfold and my pain level was at a 20 on a 1 to 10 scale, and I needed another ablation. Dr. Holland quickly approved the procedure after literally a 30-second consultation.

The second procedure in August 2024 resulted in severe pain and complications. I had NEVER had shooting, burning pain going down my legs before my second procedure!!!  I contacted the office, Nurses and DRs expressing my concerns that the wrong nerves had been treated.
My mid back has hurt me since 1998 and all the sudden the pain was gone?? Did the Dr burn the wrong nerves? but I was met with dismissive and argumentative responses. To make matters worse, Dr. Holland retired, and the new doctor was equally dismissive, refusing to listen to my concerns and offering an epidural procedure instead!  This sounds absolutely NUTS to me! Good thing I requested my medical records before they could go in and change any negligence on their behalf.

Now, I'm left with unresolved pain and nerve damage, fearing potential long-term consequences. I strongly advise against seeking treatment at National Spine and Pain Centers due to the incompetence and lack of compassion demonstrated by their staff. If anyone knows of a reliable practice that can provide competent and compassionate care, please let me know.""|So first let me set up the back story. A few months back I had a seizure while riding in a vehicle and because of the seat belt I ended up breaking my own back. Burst fracture of my T-12 vertebra. I now have rods and screws in my spine, which formed a cast to help support the break. My neurologist was very adamant that I take my seizure medication on time and that I get plenty of sleep. I have been unable to sleep more than a few spurts through out the night because of the pain in my back.
Now here's my experience with Dr. Holland and his TA. Day #1 I walk in and i Immediately hear a 70+ year old man in agony trying to get his prescription filled only to have the nurse tell him there is nothing that can be done. Already not a good start. I then wait for my turn and proceed to talk with Dr. Holland and explain what is going on and what has been done already. Dr. Holland then immediately starts to argue with me about my previous medical procedure. Stating ""no you're actually fused"" and treating me and my wife as if we are moron's. He did however come back and apologize for being wrong but only after having to argue with him multiple times! He then sends me home with a prescription that I attempted to take and my body just wasn't having any of it. I even took 1/8th of a pill to try to get some relief without throwing up. No luck. So I then make another appointment and go back take a urine sample with out anyone watching and proceed to put it in the bin along with 4 other samples all of which could be tampered with by anyone who uses the bathroom. They then proceed to prescribe me an anti-inflammatory, which did absolutely nothing for my pain. I go back and he then agrees to write me a prescription for what he says is ""Oxycodone"". i get to the pharmacy and find out it's the Percocet, which is what my Dr. originally put me on after my surgery and then changed it to standard Oxy HCL 5mg because it was causing me to be Numbed out and depressed and for some reason. I explained this to Dr. Holland and he literally accused me of trying to get medication to sell on the street! This man is rude, jaded and an absolutely terrible Dr. How can any Dr. who took an oath to do no harm treat anyone like this?! Refusing to help a patient in need is a violation of their Oath! I would not recommend anyone go to this cold heartless place!
July 12, 2024|On the first day, after a long stint in the waiting room, Dr. Holland and his  black-haired assistant seemed unsympathetic, distrusting, and somewhat annoyed.  The assistant pointed out something in my chart to indicate that I had lied.  I was too embarrassed and confused to try to explain. I did not lie.

The treatment that Dr. Holland prescribed was an epidural steroid injection, even though I had explained that I had already had this  treatment twice before without any results whatsoever. On the day of the treatment, Dr. Holland and his assistant were, I thought, ,unnecessarily rough.    They showed very little care or compassion. But the worst is that they did not explain to me how much the procedure would hurt. It was the worst pain I have ever felt. I was not prepared for it because my previous two injections were done at a hospital clinic, where a great deal of lidocaine is used beforehand to prevent the pain.  This pair succeeded in understating the pain, saying that would only last for a few seconds.  Nobody prepared me for what what was about to happen.  Immediately afterwards, Dr. Holland fled from the room, shouting over his shoulder without looking at me, ""come back in two weeks.""   The assistant was unsympathetic and ignored my weeping.

I went out to my car shaky, shocked and disoriented, lost my balance, and collapsed.  I wasn't injured but was afraid to drive home.

The ladies who prepared me for the procedure were extremely kind and professional and tried to explain to me why I was receiving no pain medication.  By then it was too late.  I could never have anticipated what was about to happen anyway.

Another  note.  Beforehand, I asked the black-haired assistant if my insurance would cover more than 3 treatments, this being my third. The answer was no, but she confided that they could arrange self- payment.

This procedure must be a big moneymaker for these people, as they prescribed it without explaining it clearly and without discussing any alternative treatment.

I feel mistreated and exploited.|It seems that this office or the practitioner it's just interested in pushing treatments without cures and answers  I'm losing respect for this office What happened the patient's rights? And what happened to bedside matters from the doctors or the practitioners? Mainly the last practitioner that supposedly knew what she was doing? She is lowering patience well-being by not answering questions by the patient or physical examination Hands-On feel where the problem is, she didn't do this, she was more interested in getting out of the office visit ASAP When I told her that I'm feeling a movement in my lower left side and asked her what it could be, her reply was and I quote ""I don't know"" RED FLAGS
And this leaves me, a very very untrusting feeling I need answers I want answers, not just some brush off That's what I felt from her There was NO RESPECT And when she asked about physical therapy, I explained to her that I work out of Houston Texas in the oilfield business. She wrote it down a little tablet that I refused physical therapy, a lie and then what she said I can talk to the surgeon, well the surgeon to me means scheduling surgery She did not elaborate, the doctor  The doctor to me means, he'll examine me and give me answers, again she did not elaborate Which was very confusin, you should have said do you want to speak to the doctor I will tell her yes
She was quick to put in a tablet again that I refused, another lie I am confused nervous and scared that I might end up in a wheelchair, she did not elaborate her answers to me Again I felt betrayed abused and disrespected by her, this is not how you treat patients who are worried and scared, I want answers before I make my decision, I don't want to be pushed into something I do not agree with Killing the nerves in my back seems pointless? I want to know which is better, killing in my nerves first or surgery first, then maybe doing something about the nerves in my back
I'll be up there my next visit, but like I said I will not do any procedures until I get answers, answers to me that makes sense

The doctors actually care and do everything they can to help.|Thank You to Dr. Tannous, Ariana and Minh!

Today, I am filled with gratitude as I have the honor of sharing a truly inspiring story of hope, healing, and remarkable care.

In the journey of life, we often encounter individuals who leave a lasting impact on our hearts and minds. Dr. Tannous and his dedicated team, Ariana and Minh, have not only provided exceptional medical care but have also demonstrated the true essence of compassion and professionalism.

I recently had the privilege of witnessing the transformative power of Dr. Tannous's expertise. After struggling with the debilitating effects of multiple herniated discs in my neck, I had almost lost hope of ever experiencing a pain-free existence. However, Dr. Tannous's love, care and expertise have healed me. I really feel like I was cared for with love and treated like family.

Writing this with tears of joy streaming down my face!!!|Dr didn't listen to me. Dr called in a prescription that cost $700 after insurance which I wasn't paying that price. I explained what my surgeon prescribed and told him that was working well for me. He then called in a prescription for oxy which I can't tolerate.
I called back and the receptionist was extremely rude and very disrespectful.
There is a huge level of miscommunication there. I'm not going by!!|I was able to make an appointment within a day of calling after suffering for nearly 2 months with neck pain.  The entire staff is extremely helpful and friendly.  Cannot say enough good things about Dr. Tannous and his tech Min.

I was also able to get treatment that day.

We arrived early as instructed to complete new patient paperwork and waited for 45 minutes to see Dr. Patel once brought into a room. When I made the appointment, I requested a date/time to see Dr. Patel. We never saw Dr. Patel during our visit and was told that something had come up with another patient which prevented him from seeing us.  Before leaving, we did eventually speak with a Physician Assistant. PAs are wonderfully competent members of one's health team and seeing one would not have been problematic after the first initial consult. The Center's recommended treatment plan is to start with injections, but how would anyone think/feel about receiving treatment without meeting the individual who is going to stick a needle in one's spine? My dad and I left after being at the practice for 90+ minutes.

I have recently learned the Haymarket location has the practice of their mid-level professionals meeting with a new patient for their initial consult. Again, not an issue if this was communicated to us at the time of scheduling or before the appointment.  I have requested a transfer of care to another National Spine & Pain Center location nearby. Based on the online reviews I have read and what I observed while we waited in the practice, I don't doubt that Dr. Patel is a fine physician and pain medicine specialist; however, there needs to be clearer lines of communication with patients (old and new), and adoption of transparency and some new practices to help engender patient trust that is critical in an optimal patient experience and outcomes.|I am thankful to Dr. Patel and his team. They provide excellent care. I have experienced outstanding communication from the front desk to the medical providers. Dealing with chronic pain is something I never imagined having to live with. I am grateful to have them walking this journey with me.|Dr.  Patel was the ABSOLUTE BEST, MOST COMPASSIONATE, CARING,  UNDERSTANDING doctor I ever had.  I am extremely happy for Dr. Patel that he has moved on to bigger and better thing....... However, I am extremely upset that he had to leave, because I have not been the same since he left even though I still get injections.  He helped my husband through a car accident and got him on his feet again (without narcotics)and it was just always a pleasure going to see him.  (even though we were getting a bunch of needles in our back) I really miss him and wish I was able to continue to have him as my doctor.  Wherever he is, and whoever has him as a doctor is extremely blessed because he is an extremely intelligent, compassionate,  amazing doctor that really makes a difference in his patients lives.   I appreciate the time I had with him and wish him the best|I have been in this office for years start seeing Ms. Suares and she is great for years taking care of my lower back pain as the pain is always controllable by her. The office switched me to Ms. Hiral all the sudden and I started seeing her for months and it was alright. I got developed a SEVERE neck, shoulders and upper back pain on March and was NOT controllable by any of the method that I did with my lower back pain. Hiral was NOT taking my upper back pain as serious as I feel now. She sent me to Physical therapy ( which I already do at home ) also to MRI and she gave C 2 pain medicine for 10 days.That was a great relief but temporarily. My intentions for coming to her was getting a steroid shot for long term relief. I could not get an appointment for MRI within 10 days but it was 21+ days so I was seeking a compensation for C2 pain medicine until I got MRI. I work in the pharmacy and I am aware about regulation for these medicines BUT, when they had me to come back to the office, Hiral was extremely disrespected me . Accusing me for abusing pain medication. Hey I am a single mom that has 2 jobs and full custody for my daughter and I am in SEVERE pain I do not want this attitude. I was asking her during that visit what is the chance of getting relief after cortisone shot , she was NOT listening to me. She kept saying no more pain medicine until you get MRI. I asked her if she can do physical exam (which she NEVER touch me to exam me) she was disrespectfully looking into my batch that says my name and Pharmacy info I work. She did look at this batch probably 10 times during the visit giving me a hint that I work in medical field so I should stop asking for pain medicine. I know they do have a system that can look in Virginia, Maryland and DC for my past control medication I have taken and she saw I did NOT take any C2 medication since I delivered my daughter 7 years ago. Why this accusing  and disrespect. When you are in pain you need someone to assure you. Instead Hiral made me cry that night the way she was talking to me. Back to my visit to review my MRI. Hiral could not be able making a call for them and ask, she sent her nurse to accuse me not getting MRI done, I went back to my car to bring MRI CD. Then she said Fairfax radiology system was down. Why did not you call then to find out where is my MRI before you sending the nurse telling me I did not get the MRI. Again it was another disrespect. Getting  steroid shot, Dr. Patel told me there is minimal inflammation that close enough to say I have nothing wrong and it's like normal finding does not correspond to the pain I describe. I asked him while he was giving me the shot in my neck weather the finding on my right more since my pain is a lot of more on my right. He kept saying there is NO finding in you MRI except minimal inflammation. When I put my hand on my neck and shoulders I do not feel muscle, I feel a BIG ROCK, so what kind of minimum inflammation cause a rock feel like muscles? Anyway it was few weeks since I got the shot and I feel 0% relief. I am out of work right now as I can't work anymore. The pain is AS ITS with PT  and NSAID's that do nothing. I and my primary care doctor asked the office to fax the records for her 3-4 times and it was NEVER done. Until I had to walk into the office and get the records from the receptionists myself. Here are 2 things shocking there when I came to the office: 1- I read my MRI report as ( I am a doctor in different country and I am a medical student here as well) the finding was bulging disk, spondylosis , fissures and HERNIATED DISK from C4 until C7. The herniation and the bulging is mostly on the RIGHT side. 2- I asked the receptionist why Dr. Patel did not tell me about these results? The answer was giving me a deaf ears. When I got the full medical report and walk out the door I turn around and I found the 3 receptionist laughing so hard at me. Is it a real professional place?|Dr. Patel is one of the best doctors I've ever known. He has a great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable in his field.

GU  and his staff are very professional,  quality  individual time spent with me.

I would recommend this office to anyone who needs good care.|I told them that my situation and had to leave to new Jersey! I waited since 12 n now it's 430 and the office close but me and the drugstore kept calling back to back for over an hour! The nurses are sweet and kind but I miss Dr Steve I've never had this experience before but how can serve and help your patients when you don't answer the phone???? And it was 2 of us calling back to back! Nice I have to cancel my ride and try another one. This is very frustrating|Medical personnel changed without any notification. New representative was more interested in changing my appointment because it was Thanksgiving week. My appointment was earlier in the week so I'm guessing it was to accommodate other people not me. I've been a patient there for years and should not be reposted to accommodate others.|When you are in severe pain, it is especially important that things run smooth (I know it is a ""process""), but nothing went smooth with my experience here.  First P.A. I saw was pretty unprofessional.  2nd appointment was to go over my MRI but it was such a quick appointment my head was spinning and I later found out she glanced at my MRI but didn't keep the information to submit to my insurance, therefore, after another month went by in pain, the appointment I had schedule for an injection was denied because the MRI results weren't sent to the insurance company.  I found this out the day before the scheduled appointment.  So ANOTHER month to wait for an appointment for injection (while suffering in pain ).  Dr. Gu was unsympathetic and unapologetic for them dropping the ball.   Also, one week later , they still haven't sent the required info to the insurance company (and I literally BEGGED Dr. Gu to expedite re-submitting).    Also, one appointment was written on the check out paper for me, but they didn't put it in the computer so I was not on the schedule!  Also, I have sent 3 or 4 messages through the portal and not one has had a response.  Very upsetting to go through all of this while in pain.  They did prescribe pain meds and asked if I wanted more.|On jan 6 they were closed because of snow.  so i called to make an appointment i was put on message machine.  I never heard back so i called today Jan 7 i was still on message machine i couldnt get thru to talk to anyone i wanted to just talk to someone.  But i was locked on message machine from the day before.  I have been coming for about 3 years and i am on pain meds I could go thru withdraw .  i have limited days because i have to do chemo soon i would just like a call back. other places have worked with me who have lots of patients.

The clinic staff treats you like a human being and they are attentive to your needs.|I have been in pain management for several year's due a blown out lower back and knees from a motorcycle crash.. I have received every injection there is offered to the lower back and nothing has lasted for more then two week at best and very paiful. My first visit with Dr. Gu was an evaluation.  I exspained to Dr. Gu the many back injections I had received in the past didn't last and I was not interested. I had a follow up appointment with my back surgeon whom stated back injections were not advised. I returned to Dr Gu for my second visit and advised Dr. Gu of my surgons opinion to the injections. Dr Gu went forward with a nerve test  and requested that I teturn with a current MRI on my next visit so he may go forward with the six injections in my lower back. I feel as though Dr Gu is not listening to me or taking into account that injections do not work for me or my surgons recommendation. I feel that the injections are a money maker at  $800 per set of 2 not to mention that there is an expensive co pay involved. I will not be returning to his office for treatment.  I do feel that Dr Gu is a good Dr, but did not listen to me.|First visit has left a very poor taste for this practice. The receptionist was rude and didn't even know how to do her job. There was a slide asking me to agree to let my information be used for affiliates. I don't want that and didn't want sign that screen. It wouldn't let me proceed without signing that slide. Of course I can't be seen if I can't get past that screen. When I asked for help she was short with me and told me no one had ever refused to sign that screen. I told her I read it and didn't agree. I figured a way to get around it, no thanks to her rudeness. I then listened to her complain about how much work she had. I really didn't need to hear all of that. So, I went to get an appointment for shots that were recommended and was given is a month away. I am in pain, that's why I'm there. It took several weeks to get in, now wait a month to get the shots.

They are compassionate and very efficient. The doctor I see is very good!|I wouldn't even give this one Star. If you have chronic pain that keeps you unable to do daily life activities without having this pain eating at you in the back of your mind constantly, do not go here.

The admin and nursing staff were nice enough. So was Dr George Lin. He was...pleasant, but you quickly feel as though you're just another faceless patient, a number on a sheet, a nice bill.

My appointments were spaced four to six months apart. As I'm reading the office notes from my records printout (I'm going to another pain management place and needed the records), I see that on the notes it says that my last appointment, 12/30/20, says to return on 4/30/21. This is a lie. I was told to make an appointment for June, so I did for 6/09/21. It also says to contact him if my symptoms worsen or fail to improve. I was never told this in our appointment, so this is also a lie. On my first appointment, 8/25/20, it says to return on 11/25/20. I was told to return at the end of December. Another lie. Again, contact him if my simpsons worsen or fail to improve. This was not told to me. Another lie.

I already knew I had a herniated disc at L4-5 from a previous injury in 2012. I received my MRI results a day after my MRI via the Sentara app, and it turns out I have two more bulging discs at L2-3 and L3-4 with an annular tear at L3-4. I was never contacted by his office to go over the test results. I had to Google what an annular tear is to figure out what this new issue is.

Basically, I'm in a lot of freaking pain. I get maybe 4 hours of sleep a night before I wake up with horrible slicing pain across my lower back and around my hips. Sometimes, it runs down my right buttock and down to my right knee. I cannot put even the slightest finger pressure on my lower spine without sharp pain.

I live every day in hell with this pain. If you're like this, then this is definitely not the doctor for you. Minor injuries or acute pain, sure. But lifestyle changing pain, definitely not because you are not a person here. You are just words and numbers on a chart.|My experience was wonderful. The receptionist made me feel welcome. The waiting area was clean and the wait times were minimal. The nurses in the back seem happy to be there and were helpful.

The doctor I saw was professional and made me laugh. He was patient with me to help me understand what his thoughts were on my condition and what possible options are available.|Terrible experience. I 1st saw Dr. Lin who was very informed of my condition but only gave me pamphlet with exercises, offered me drugs  but no lasting solutions. Said I could do injections which would take 2-weeks to schedule. Called to schedule and the 1st appointment was 2 - Months away. If you are in serious pain, this IS NOT the place to go. I will never use a Sentara run practice again as it was a complete waist of time and they only care about milking your insurance.|Dr george Lin was the most passive doctor i have ever encountered. He didnt care to acknowledge my pain or what he had already prescribed and when i went to explain this he gave me a look of shock. He asked me "" what i wanted"" i told him hes the doctor. Spoke with his manager a very nice gentleman. He should be the doctor. Beware people. Choose wisely|Very disappointed with this facility. First, everyone involved was very nice, professional and seemed to know their jobs very well. The problem was with billing. I was seen for an eval and scheduled for spinal injections to hopefully relieve my back and leg pains. I asked at that time, what my cost share would be. I was told they would submit the paperwork to the insurance company and they would let me know before the procedure. They also suggested I could call Sentara billing for an answer.

Well I call Sentara billing and first they can't even find the procedure code. Then they give me an estimate of several thousands of dollars (for a similar code). So I asked what my cost share would be; they don't know. I'm told I need to call my insurance company for that information. I call the insurance company and they say they can't provide an estimate unless the provider submits a pre-authorization request. A request the provider told me they were already submitting, so I figure I'll just want and see.

Well a few days before the procedure, I get a call to confirm the appointment. I asked about the cost share. They tell me, a pre-approval wasn't needed so they did not submit one to the insurance company and they don't know what my cost share will be. So I tell them if I can't get at least a reasonable estimate of the cost share I need to cancel the appointment. No attempt as resolution, appointment canceled.

Completely unacceptable. Who thinks it's reasonable for a customer to enter into a transaction without knowing at least an estimated price? It could be $41 or $4100. Big difference and Sentara should know better.|If you are looking for alternative solutions for pain, this is fine.  They prescribe non-opiod meds, prefer you go to physical therapy, and offer injections. It can get frustrating if those don't work for you. But, at least you tried and then you can go to another pain mgmt. that may prescribe pain meds.|Wait times are extremely long.",2024-10-02|2021-02-11|2019-12-03|2019-05-15|2019-08-09|2019-04-18|2020-09-15|2025-01-06,5|1|5|1|1|1|3|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJoyYzUJ2_uokRN9vgyiVszbo,15

I love the vibes I get from him and he really does seem to care about the well being of his patients. Thank you!!|Dr Gibellato performed an RFA ion my lumbar spine. I had one done 3 years ago at a different practice and it was one of the most painful experiences I've ever had. I was so afraid to have it done again but I knew I needed to. I told the staff and Dr Gibellato about my prior experience and they all assured me that what I experienced before wasn't normal.. He promised me I wouldn't feel pain like that with him and he was a man of his word. Whenever I began to feel pain, he numbed me more and the pain stopped. He took into consideration that I also have Fibromyalgia and that causes me to feel more pain than someone who does not. Because of him, this RFA was no more painful than having a cavity filled. He explained everything prior to the procedure and as things came up during the procedure. He constantly asked how I was doing while the procedure was in progress. His bedside manner, understanding and empathy were like nothing I've experienced from a provider. The entire staff was fabulous. If you've had a bad experience with pain management in the past, I'd really encourage you to consider at least meeting with Dr. Gibellato.  I'm so grateful for him.|First let me say what was great about the whole time at the procedure ward. My doctor is the best. I trust him, feel very well taken care of by him and will always feel that he is looking out for my best interest. The staff in the procedure room are also some of the best.
The prep staff should all be fired and a new staff bought in and trained on how to treat patients, to make them feel like a person and not something that they can treat like a dog. I'm sorry I bet they treat their dog better than what I saw, heard and felt like I was treated and others around me.
I hate writing a review like this. If you can look back you will see that I have written more positive reviews then negative ones.|Very pleasant visit here. Waiting time was short. Staff were caring and friendly. Dr. Gibellatto talked to me during the injections making sure I was ok. I would definitely recommend this office to others!|They did a fantastic job and he explained everything he was doing to make me feel comfortable.

I made two visits to this location and had a third one scheduled.

During one of those visits, I waited over an hour past my appointment time to see the doctor. While waiting 15-20 minutes is understandable, waiting an entire hour and being dismissed when I inquired about the delay was off-putting. My appointment was at 8:30 am, and the office opens at 8:00 am, yet I was told, ""Yeah, well there are people ahead of you,"" even though the waiting room had their first patient of the day when I arrived. An hour delay as one of the first patients of the day? Things happen, but if people are running late, just say so--don't dismiss the customer as if they're wrong for asking.

For my third visit, it was canceled just a few days prior, and I was rescheduled for six weeks out! The reason? The doctor went on vacation. When I called a few weeks before this delayed appointment to better understand possible recovery, I couldn't reach anyone. When I finally did, I was told to call back the following week.

Which leads to my most recent interaction. The call began professionally and respectfully; however, when they started to backtrack on their word about the processes/policies in place and concerns discussed previously, my inquiries were quickly dismissed. Some front staff members, particularly MCJ, are unprofessional--interrupting patients, dismissing valid questions, and doubling down when confronted about their disrespect, exacerbating the situation. Naturally, a patient will be frustrated when there's inconsistency along with, curt and dismissive responses, when they just want to better understand their upcoming medical procedures.

Invest in some customer service training for your staff.

By the notes they placed on the Sentara App, it's clear they will continue to find a way to blame the patient/customer for negative interactions, despite their evident lack of professionalism.

I'm not perfect, and I try to be a reasonable individual, but the way I was treated while trying to get answers and clarification is unacceptable; not to mention the significant delay to be seen after the scheduled appointment time.

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the one nurse in the discharge area who is very polite and genuinely tries to help the customer, rather than making their experience more difficult.|I went several years ago to this place because my neuro's office is below him. I watched the front office staff verbally abuse a man who was mentally handicapped. It went on loudly in front of the entire waiting room. I spoke to the nurse about it and when the doctor came in he wouldn't speak to me, he'd only give me 2 trigger point injections where he wanted them to go and left with me face down asking him questions. I finally realized he'd gone. No one told me to sit up or help me up or anything. When I got up the nurse was just sitting there looking at me like I was so pitiful. I said he didn't hear a thing I said did he. She just shook her head and left the room. I should have known not to see this ""doctor"" because at my first visit I was given questions about sex abuse, do I go to AA, do I have friends in 12 step groups. I wasn't even there for pain meds. And when I finally saw him he wouldn't answer my questions, he'd just grunt at me.|I was a patient of Ali Baalaki. The nursing staff was very professional, and courteous. I have never been so humiliated and disgusted, as I was on that day. My initial appointment was for back pain. He came in shook my hand, and than completely medical gaslighted me during the 5 minute visit. Your overweight, do you exercise? How many times? This is how the conversation started. I asked if I could get something in writing to reduce my hours so I wouldn't have to be on my feet for 8 hours with my back hurting bad as it was. I was told that's for disability, and your not getting it. Just nasty. I will not EVER return back to this practice, because of my experience, and the lack of empathy, and sympathy!!|I had a steroid injection by Dr. Baalbaki and couldn't be more pleased with the whole procedure. The nurses were awesome in coaching me along and Dr. Baalbaki did so as well. They are a very caring and competent group. Many thanks to all of you for a job well done.|I have an appt at 3:00 pm. But the lady called me to come at 10:30 instead. I told her I cant because my husband drove me to work, i just said I will come before 2 or early as I can. I came 140 and waiting for more than a hours, the front desk said that they keep my appt at 3pm. So, whats the reason of coming early. I havent eaten yet because I am not allowed to eat for 6 hours before the injection.|I was a patient of Dr. Lin's, on a weak pain killer for my chronic pain which comes from numerous different things that definitely warrant pain management. So after being on this certain medication for over a year, it stopped working... I told her during numerous appointments that I had with her that it stopped working and I stopped taking it and she did and said nothing about it, just kept saying ""thing will get better."" Well, of course, nothing did get better, and after a few more appointments and drug screens, my future appointment was cancelled without my knowledge, because my drug test came back negative. Told her she knew why that was. Even the medication said it was as needed.

I wouldn't trust this office at all. I'm not sure how the other doctor is, but I did nothing wrong, and now I'm having a hard time finding another pain doctor who will accept me now with my worsening symptoms. My PCP and Wound Healing Doctor keep referring me out left and right and I keep getting denied.|After suffering chronic pain to both of my legs for 2 years due to injuries and surgeries I was finally referred to Dr. Lin for pain management.  Being a new patient I had to wait over a month for an appointment.  When I showed up for the appointment things started out good.  I was called back from the waiting room on time and given the initial check and registration from the nurse, then left to wait for the Doctor.  After a few minutes the nurse came in to tell me I was next and ask if I wanted some water.  I then sat waiting (in a very hard and uncomfortable chair) for 50 minutes.  My appointment time was 8:45, it was now 9:40 and I still had not seen the Doctor and no one came in to check on me or tell me what was going on.  At 9:45 I decided that I had waited long enough, both my legs hurt from sitting in the hard straight backed chair and my knee was starting to swell, it was time to leave and make arrangements with my Doctor to see someone else.  As I was leaving the nurse ask ""are you leaving"" I said yes, she then got an attitude with me and said ""I told you that you we're next"".  I said yes but that was over 40 minutes ago, the Doctor is running to late.  Her reply; ""She is not running late, she's on time"".  So I asked what time my appointment was, ""8:45"", and what time is it now, ""9:45"", I thanked her and proceeded out through the waiting room.  She had a few parting words for me as I left but I didn't stop to listen.  As I was passing through the waiting room I was ask to talk with the office manager.  I explained the situation and my feelings on the matter.  Told her I was a reasonable person and if someone had came in, told me they were running late, ask to reschedule or if I wanted to sit back in the waiting room where its more comfortable I would have accepted and been fine with it, but that's not what happened.  The only thing she would offer was to make another appointment.  I told her I would reschedule but only if the Doctor I was going to see would speak with me first about todays visit.  They declined so I didn't schedule another appointment.  After leaving I called my PCP to tell them what happened and ask what to do next.  Getting in to see a pain management specialist is not easy.  They have to review your case and decide if they want to accept you as a patient, it takes a long time.  They agreed that leaving was the right thing to do and that they would have done the same thing in that situation.  Now I'm stuck without pain management treatments or therapies, waiting on a hip replacement to correct 1 injury that I've had 3 surgeries on already.  As well as sever soft tissue injures to my knee, shoulder and elbow that I have to contend with while trying to get them repaired 1 at a time.  I feel that the way I was treated was disrespectful and uncalled for.  Nearly every time I've had to go to the Sentra Careplex  in Hampton I've been treated rudely by Doctors and staff.  I didn't even want to take the referral to them but felt I had no choice if I wanted help... never again.  I will never willingly go into or be taken to this hospital again.  Also, I do not believe the reviews they give themselves on their website.  Compared to reviews from independent review sites they are either ""cherry picked"" or just false.|It took months to get an appointment here.  Then, when I finally saw the doctor she recommended an injection procedure that she said will solve all my  issues.  I was ecstatic since no one has been able to help me before!  Then, 4 days later the office called to say they do not take my insurance for procedures.  What?  They take my insurance for the doctor visit but NOT for procedures!!  So they want more money than your insurance will pay.  Don't go there and get your hopes up unless you can pay thousands for the miracle procedure they will promise you!",2024-08-15|2024-08-09|2023-10-07|2024-04-24|2023-08-23|2020-11-06|2019-04-30|2019-05-14,2|1|1|5|1|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|rude_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJec1ogQyDuokRO5rkxJy24_o,19

I drive from Christiansburg to Roanoke because I love Arun Sun, her nurse and the office staff. The treatments have helped my migraines tremendously. Arun has always done a wonderful job, and the front office staff has always been so kind to me. Angel has been, just that, an Angel. I don't know how she deals with the insurance side of things day in and day out. She works hard to make sure my botox arrives prior to my scheduled appointments. If something goes wrong with insurance, she's on top of it and her and Arun will work together to work me in as soon as it arrives. They are the best and I highly recommend. I have been through a lot health wise and even drive 4 hours for one of my doctors. So when I find good people, who care and are good at their jobs, I'll drive far distances. These guys and girls are great!|No problems. Very efficient on patient flow. Was in first time, called back on time, got shot in back, out in 20min after being called.back. Dr. Raju and staff were great. Explained everything, I didn't even know they were done with iniection when they told.me to get up.
And you can call direct for follow-up instead of going back to referring doctor for follow-up to just to have them send you back to pain clinic!! Greatly saves on time, pain,  and money.
This is NOT a pill mill. If you're just looking for pills this ain't the place!! The DO NOT prescribe opiates on a first visit. When I requested them on follow up visit with the PA to help me until next nerve root shot (different nerve), Ms.Rickman rx'd me with no problem. Same when I requested refill on meds after a week and a half, no hassles whatsoever.
FYI they use the Virginia controlled drug tracking system!! And post the report to your record. So don't try doctor shopping.
I've been a ""pain clinic"" patient before and it's nice to be in one that isn't trying to treat pain with antidepressants, anticonvulsants and other unapproved (by FDA, for pain) meds.
Overall, great service, no hassles. Recommended.
And Louis bird approves  lol.|First off: Fine racket they've got going on her.  Just keep having them come in for steroid shots even if they don't help. Anything else you suggest falls on deaf ears,  after all,  your not the Dr,  your just the patient that feels the pain and knows exactly where it is and not where they say it is.  With that being said,  this was my third visit with Margaret Rickman Pa-C, and given the third try, the benefit of doubt. I've come to the conclusion I was completely right. Needs to go back to her cheerleader days, where she can have the standing ovations she was used too. She's dismissive. Likes to hear herself talk,  does not like to be questioned on her recommendations, even though it's your body, your pain. Just going off reports,  she miraculously knows what is right for you.... PERIOD! It's funny how I already knew what kind of person she was,  without even knowing her. She's used to having patients that just nod their heads yes to her ever whim and praise her. Clocks out, gets her nails done,  everyone tells her how perfect she is and collects her check. Ms. Popular, center stage college years,  carried over in her professional life leaves a lot to be said about self growth,  compassion and dedication to others and not herself first! But it's hard to do when you've been catered to your entire life.  Never once listening to her patients.  After all, it will interfere with the wonderful racket of collecting on constant spine injections nicely directed over to Dr Raju. Dr. Raju and the nurses are very polite. But this little homecoming queen leaves a lot to be said of her bed side manner and self absorbed attitude. Wouldn't recommend this place for my dog's pain management.|Dr. Raju is so very kind and caring! She truly cares about her patients!!! She is very patient and takes the time to listen to all concerns. I feel the same about her PA Kate Duff. She is also a sweetie that listens and truly cares!! Don't hesitate to make an appointment with them!! Doctors that are sincere and truly care and are exceptionally talented and skillful are so hard to come by!!|Understanding,  sympathetic,  professional,  thorough, careful, have my best interests and health as their priority!! Dr Raju, Dr Rickman, and all nurses and office staff are wonderful!! THANK YOU for helping me with chronic pain!!|I have been seeing Dr. Raju for months now & she is so kind & thorough, & puts your mind at ease. I have been getting shots in my back & have had one Nerve Burn & getting ready to have one on the other side & have yet to feel a needle! I highly recommend her!|I absolutely love going here. The nurses are great and kind, the receptionist is very kind and the Dr is wonderful and also extremely kind! They take good care of you and listen to you. I haven't had any back problems since I've started and I've lived with back problems my whole life!|Dr. Raju is awesome.. The nurses are very caring and explanatory of the procedures.

They told me I would have to attend and complete physical therapy before I could make an appointment with them. I asked the lady if this was their office policy or if it was pertaining to my insurance not covering the visit until I completed physical therapy. Without contacting my insurance company she made this assumption and when I called my insurance company to confirm this I was informed that my insurance did not require me to complete or even attend physical therapy in order for them to fully cover the injection I was referred to their office to get. So when I called the office back to let them know this they continued to argue with me that the all insurance companies they have ever dealt with required physical therapy first. I  would not want to be seen at this office at  all in fear that they do not know what they are doing when it comes to billing and insurance practices. They should never make an assumptions based on everyone else's insurance.|I had some shots done.. I had a couple of bulging discs and herniated disc in my back. I felt okay for a day or two. Then it got real bad. I called them. There must be a nurse there named Robin.. while explaining what I was going through and trying to understand what the hell was happening.  She literally hung up on me. Completely unprofessional I didn't even bother calling back because I knew I would lose my shit. Don't go here. It's been over a week and I still can't walk. I was in better shape before I had the shots. Whether or not it'll get better in a couple weeks I don't know. But at this point right now I don't appreciate being hung up on in the middle of a phone call. Find someplace else to go|Stanley Hatcher does not care about you. This man treated me as if I was medication seeking when I was begging for an MRI so we could see the damage to my spine. Refused to listen to my concerns. I do not walk straight anymore. My feet drop. The weakness in my legs has worsened in the course of a few months and he did not care. He did not listen to me. I did the PT that insurance wanted to approve the MRI. Stanley decided not to disclose ANY treatment that was done, to the insurance so they denied my MRI AGAIN. He is a horrible excuse for a doctor and is in the wrong career. Not to mention how many times he canceled my appointments due to ""personal reasons"" and took me another month after to get in. He is dismissive, arrogant, and lazy.
***Wanted to add that they were also rude to my PCP who just wanted to get my records so he could refer me somewhere else and found that they lied in my records as well. Claiming I didn't meet requirements for an MRI. My spine is severely damaged. Their negligence could have cost me my ability to walk. Save yourself and go elsewhere.|I have had an awesome experience with this clinic. Justin Nolan PA C saw me first. I admit I was very nervous and he put me at ease and gave me hope for my back issues. He gave me options and I chose to have steroid injections. That was today with Dr Greer whom was so kind, explained everything he was about to do in terms I could understand and what I could expect before and afterwards. Everyone treated me with respect, a smile on their faces, took their time with me, allowed me to ask questions and were very patient. This goes for everyone I came in contact with from registrars, nurses, Doctors, Medical Student, the Pa and for anyone I may have not mentioned.

THEY LIE, THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL,  ALL THIS PLACE WILL DO IS ADD MENTAL PAIN TO YOUR PHYSICAL PAIN!!
Id rate this place 0 stars if i could. This is the by far the worse experience of my life.  Front desk is rude and argumentative the doctors and nurses don't care about the patients or their pain.

Had a surgery for an scs implant scheduled for the 19th of Oct to be called a few days before and told they have to reschedule me ta be told they don't know when when I asked them what day.... then because I told them that they are unprofessional handling my surgery like that. They dropped me as a patient claiming that ""my treatment of staff was inappropriate "" stay away from this place.  They don't care about anything but themselves.

I had a np of neurosurgery at uva Karen Clark was same way just absolutely super people I just thankful they patient with a old courty boy like me that just doesn't understand all that been going on god bless them|I'd advise people to go ANYWHERE but here. They performed injections in the wrong place three times before finally one of the doctors at the office realized it. After the 4th injection in the correct place, I couldn't receive any further injections because the insurance would only pay for 4 a year and they'd already paid for the ones the doctors at this office screwed up.

The rest of the office is just as incompetent. They don't return phone calls or care that you've had to go to the ER. They'll make notes claiming they made calls they didn't. They also put things in the patient chart that were never said.

From managing my pain medications to   offering many suggestions on other ways to control my pain through minor procedures &
helpful tips for things that increase my quality of life. He has recommended a type of shoe that is comfortable and easy to get on & giving me helpful tips on things to do to lesson my pain.i know he cares & is always willing to offer advice on how to handle swelling & other things that pop up from my injuries. He has been great to work with & the staff is always friendly & helpful. I would highly recommend them to anyone living with pain|Dr Luebbert has always been very kind and helpful to me.   I feel he is sincerely concerned about my health and how we can work together to decrease my pain with nerve blocks/injections and get me more functional and back to work.   I would also say that there has been much improvement in his front office staff.   I cannot imagine how challenging it is for him and his kind staff with all the medical regulations, laws, insurance denials and headaches/preauthorizations/ low reimbursement,  the opioid /fentanyl epidemic crisis (which he did not create), mean people with improper expectations, (who may often read whatever on the internet and then somehow erroneously feel they are more of an expert than highly trained and board certified physicians), and the possibility of medical malpractice likely always unfortunately in the back of his mind.  I am thankful for Dr. Luebbert.  I hope he practices medicine here for many years to come.|I have been seeing Dr. Luebbert for over two years.

These ""doctors"" told me I'd be on narcotic pain meds for the rest of my life(I'm not). Last visit I had was i the middle of winter. It was 9degF outside and I rode in to my appointment on a 50cc scooter because that's all I had. After waiting a while upon arrival I was eventually told I wouldn't be seen because they no longer accepted my insurance. My toes and fingers were still numb from the ride, needless to say I was in pain. They did nothing to compensate me for my wasted time. I'm just here to beg you not to make the same mistake I did. These people are TRASH and not worthy of your time and especially not your money.|Dr. Martin Morton is the Best Pain Management that I never had before. He listened and understands and helps me with my pain every mom and always looking forward to the best of his patients.

He listens and cares for you.

Beyond that you can tell his team respects him and that they all get along well.

Just plain awful. Let's start with the Admin that are glued to their phone and look annoyed when your are at the window. They are plain rude. They forgot to get my copay one day and instead of sending me a letter, email or call they sent it to collections after 1 month. The NP Steve was horrid. I asked why I couldn't see a Dr and he said why would I need to and he had the worst bedside manner. He grilled me on my meds before realizing they were very old and used for only 3 days for surgery. On top of that 2 appointments were cancelled because they called and because I didn't pick up it was cancelled per the front desk staff. They are looking for a fast buck. Tell you to come back the next week and next week at 40$ a visit with no plan to help. If your looking for compassion and competency then go someplace else|Frustrating experience from start to finish. Rude office. Rude PAs. Incredibly disrespectful to me, so much so that I stopped taking my husband to his appnts. No sense that they actually cared. And this is a PAIN management center. Their patients are in enough pain that they're seeking expert intervention. They actually kicked my husband out of the office and refused to help him further after convincing him to undergo an incredibly expensive surgery. When that didn't relieve his pain fully, they refused to continue meds. Medical marijuana is absolutely against their principles and they refuse to treat anyone who may utilize that for pain relief. If I could give zero stars I would!|Nothing bad to say. They manage my pain meds and are by the book strict.
Edit: 1 star - I went to my appointment and was told that it was cancelled. I said by who? She said I have a note saying we called you last week and she said she left you a message. That's a complete lie. My voice-mail box has been full for thr past year, you can't leave messages. I said, well if I miss an appointment you charge $75... so pay me $75 now for you missing the appointment. Nope. Reschedule. Nah, I'm not playing games with this place. I'll go elsewhere|I took my mother to the pain clinic to see if they could address some issues she was having with her hip arthritis. We had already ruled out a hip replacement because of her age, and she already had injections that were proving to be no longer effective.

He refuses to call my insurance to submit an appeal with my PT records and he refuses to talk to me directly.  He hides behind his female nurses and makes them deal with my frustration.  Resulting from Stephen Maros incompetence I cannot even see another doctor for an MRI order because the insurance says I have to wait 90 days before I can have another MRI order for the same issue.  Stephen Maro knows I was dealing with pain for over 2 months prior to coming to see him.  I am trying to stay away from medications but he has done nothing but delay my diagnosis.  His lack of professionalism doesnt surprise me after speaking with their office manager Melinda.  I told her I am calling back because no one has returned my call.  Ive been trying to get this resolved for 2 months now but she tells me that I am not being patient enough and hangs up on me.  Stephen Maro, I hope youre reading this.

So in the hospital I go for 5 days during vacation! Got home went to the office and saw Avery! Worst visit ever! Argued with me that their was no possible way that pump would have failed and to top it off... said you shouldn't leave town if your having health issues!!! The very next visit was with Stephen Maro all he was interested in was looking at my past 3-4 urine samples! Again no relief whatsoever from the meds simply because those 2 being PA and NP think they are above anyone else!

I love how she offered practical life alternatives to LDN as well on the same page. Thank you!|I have struggled with neck pain all year and couldn't understand why someone in their early thirties would have these issues. It seemed to stem from nowhere. I've always been healthy in my food and movement in exercise. And then my PT told me about Dr. Barr. I was nervous at first thinking I'd come in for pain management and be prescribed pills for the rest of my life, but I was sorely mistaken! Dr. Barr uses a functional medicine approach, asking me about my past healthy history and emotional traumas as part of her overall holistic assessment. She made me feel like a person and not another number in a doctors office. The result of her assessment was the need for prolo therapy (similar to PRP). Unfortunately, because this was a regenerative medicine procedure, insurance did not cover it. However, it was exactly what I needed to fix the root cause of my issues with ligament instability in my neck. After three sessions of prolo I am SO much better! My pain levels decreased drastically and I feel like I have a completely different neck, in a good way! I am so glad I bit the bullet and trusted her with this. She will be my go to for any future pain management needs for my husband and I. My next health adventure will be in getting some bloodwork further assessed to determine my husband and I's overall health and identify any areas of concern.
Thank you for everything Dr. Barr and team! The front desk and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. You can tell they enjoy each others company and have fun at what they do. Good energy all around that place! Don't wait any longer in pain. Make an apt!|Dr. Barr has done more to help me in just 6 weeks than any other Dr I've seen in 4 years!! I have been suffering from chronic upper back pain for far too long. After years of physical therapy, epidural injections, cortisone shots, dry needling,  countless massages, and ultimately a 3 level acdf surgery,  my pain was worse than ever. I decided to see Dr Barr as a last resort. Sort of a medical ""Hail Mary""! At my first appt, we thoroughly discussed my health history.  I really appreciated how she listened to me, and then after examining me, determined that my pain has been coming from a totally different area all this time! It all made sense!! So far, I've had 3 sessions of Neural Prolotherapy which consists of injections directly into my mastectomy scar. What it does is it breaks up scar tissue that has engulfed surrounding nerves that wrap around to my upper back. Who would've ever thought of that?! I am making progress with every session. Dr Barr is not only brilliant, she is also very kind. I am so grateful and hopeful! My only regret is that I waited so long to see her!|I have been a patient if Dr. Barr for almost 3 years now. When I was referred to her office, I had never visited a spine specialist.  I've suffered major back issues for years. Dr. Barr and her very attentive staff was able to pinpoint the area causing the pain. The staff is compassionate and Dr. Barr is tops in her field. They key to pain management is finding the source of the pain and a solution that doesn't involve medication.  After a treatment of RFA, I can say my spasms have been reduced 80%. With some physical therapy I should  be good as new. I highly recommend Dr. Barr.|I have been going to Dr. Barr many years for back pain and have had great success. Recently I was diagnosed with a Leiomyosarcoma on the chest wall. After surgical removal of the sarcoma and several partial ribs, I was left with very limited mobility of my right arm. Physical therapy helped but not enough. Dr. Barr suggested Scar Injections. After three sessions of scar injections, I now have full mobility of my right arm with no pain. Thank you Dr. Barr.|Dr Barr has treated my husband for over 30 years, every time successfully. The latest issue was with his neck pain, she did a procedure that was difficult, she and her team never gave up until she had the results she wanted and I am happy to say he is doing great.
The thing that sets her apart is her strength, self confidence, she never gives up, she is an amazing doctor.|Dr. Lisa Barr is brilliant!  Dr. Barr diagnosed and provided immediate relief of my lower back pain in just ONE visit.  Dr. Barr is an intuitive healer with a level of expertise not easily found today.  She and her staff are warm, caring, and delightful.

Check in was easy with very little wait time. Dr. Chen Chen Costelloe was very professional and knowledgeable explaining everything. Because my husband has dementia they allowed me in the room with him. Chrissy who assisted Dr. Costelloe was engaging and very considerate. If I could give more than 5 stars I would rate them so much higher. They were genuinely there for the patient and getting the pain under control.|The billing is atrocious here. Took almost a year to receive my first bill and it was for all the sessions I received for 8 months! That is a hefty cost to pay all at once for someone on fixed income. It was baffling and I was beyond enraged because the first two visits I came up to pay my co-pay and the receptionist said there wasn't any. I had a feeling something was amiss the first visit because it took her a long time to contact my insurance, longer than other medical offices I've been to. The office staff is not on top of things at all: scheduling, alerting doctors of waiting patients, etc. It probably all stems from the surly and somewhat arrogant office manager.

That being said, the care of Drs. Fisher and Tseng is marvelous! They are real miracle workers! I've been free of lower back pain for almost four years.
PA Tristan is also excellent and provides useful suggestions pertaining to non-traditional means of pain management.|This is the best place ever!!! The staff is very friendly and will try to fit you in when possible. I was in severe pain and a little concerned about a needle placed in my back. Dr. Tseng's demeanor put me at ease and made the procedure a breeze. I'm a dentist and very grateful to have found this wonderful office.

When I attended the national spine and pain center at the VA hospital center, it was not a good experience. The doctor was ok but he kept passing me off to his many assistance. After the 4th assistant I was done. She saw my blood pressure at 190/124 and never asked questions or sent me to the e.r. she was too busy looking at the computer and trying to get urine samples.

I do not want to be highly medicated. I have been through all sorts of pain modalities and clinics, including at UVa, with no good results. Dr. Smith at UVa--their spine specialist--sent me to Dr. Messenger, and the results have been--as I've said--miraculous.

Dr. Messenger is wonderfully pleasant and he really, really wants to help you! It you are at a dead end with your treatments, please call this smart, kindly, and results-producing doctor. He has certainly changed my life.

Charlottesville|Dr. Messinger is an example of professionalism, expertise, and kindness. I have utilized his injections several times and he is precise and quick in his delivery. His staff were competent and very hospitable. Highly recommend.|Dr. Messinger is a wonderful doctor I had the pleasure of being referred to on short notice. I've had wonderful care for all of my three visits and treatments with injections. He is prompt at returning phone calls and follow up care. He listens and explains his thoughts and treatment in a simple fashion I could understand. He's a wonderful person and doctor I would recommend highly. Thank you and your staff for being so great. Kindly Deborah W.|I intended to talk about options on first visit, but quickly talked into injection. Messinger said, give me 10 minutes to call into your insurance. Returns & says it's all approved. I find out 2 weeks later my co-pay is $600. Plus, my pain has doubled immediately after injection. His response was, nothing he can do. Worst doctor experience ever. Avoid this place!|I scheduled three appointments for treatment of back pain. I arrived ten minutes early for the first appointment and waited one hour and 45 minutes for the procedure, due to ""problems"" at the front desk.
A week later I arrived ten minutes early for my second appointment and was told I was not scheduled for that day and time at all.  My three appointments had been scheduled with the front desk while both my wife and Dr. Messinger were present.  I will not be going back, which is unfortunate because I found Dr. Messinger to be a very personable and highly capable doctor.|I have been seeing Dr. Messinger for years now. He is an extremely caring physician and I have never felt like he didn't have time to listen, or explain things, to me. I respect his opinion regarding my care and since moving away from C'ville, I still go back for treatment, even though it takes me 11/4hrs to drive there. Thanks for all you do for me Dr. Messinger!!|Wish I could give more than 5 stars.  The treatment not only helped me but it was done in a very caring and professional manner.

This place lacks empathy! If you hate your job so much maybe you should just quit! Just saying,|I have been a patient since 2018. The past two years have been awful, but nothing compares to what I've experienced since January 2024. I have called last three months for my prescriptions. They failed to get prescription called in three months in a row. All new staff and no one returns a phone call. Again today, the message line for the nurse says the Mail Box is full. My daughter had to go in last month and talk to office manager and I finally got my medication that day (6 days without my medication). They treat you like a drug addicted. I'm 65 years old and retired. If it weren't for my medication I'd have to have surgery. Shame on this very unprofessional and poorly ran place.|Notice: BEWARE of DONNA FRASIER- acts like a correctional officer! Ok --- I sought help for pain while having 6 orthopedic surgeries ( 2 knees, 2 hips, and 2 shoulders). One mistake, and I was put on probation. This is fine- discharge the patient - not place a patient on criminal probation. What makes it worse is that she pulled my pain meds before the third surgery! No problem, I discharged myself and went to Roanoke to see professional pain specialists !!! This was the BEST decision I made--- now on my last surgery and life is good. This pain center is the horror story that people talk about. The one mistake was a false positive drug test that they would not let me immediately re- test. I don't drink or use! Why not the discharge?|Great place for pain management.. all the staff are great especially Vadell who works up front. She is so nice  my nurse practitioner Veronica Richardson is absolutely the best!! I highly recommend..|I am so thankful to have found the people at CPM, Dr. Susan takes the time to talk with me and find out how her treatment is working for me. My health is what she is most concerned about, but she also ask about my family, how I have been doing overall. She is a pleasure to talk with, and the Nurses make me feel comfortable each time I come in. Both Megans do excellent jobs as do the Ladies up front, all of the people that work there make office visits special for me every time I have an appointment. The PAIN that I have gone thru has been helped so much by ALL these Ladies. Thanks to Each and Every One of you.|I have only been seeing Dr. Estrada for less than a year but in that time I truly look forward to my visits. He is so attentive and takes time to really listen to me.  He cares for my needs, not only the physical pain, but for my emotional and mental health.  I really wish he could also be my primary care physician, but I am so happy to have found him for my pain management needs.|I went in on Friday and because of a mistake by their office in not having me sign a release of information form it is now Tuesday I'm still going without any help at all. I understand the opiod crisis and having to be very careful prescribing these kinds of medications but you would think a doctor would see the need for pain meds when dealing with a t-6 paraplegic due to a gun shot wound. If I can't receive help then who is??? I have no intention of begging a doctor to uphold the oath he/she took when becoming a doctor. I become more depressed each day I lay in bed with no help from these ""medical professionals"". Thanks for absolutely nothing|I've been dealing with many of the issues I see Dr. Estrada for largely since 2007, and in those 13 years, have never experienced the level of care and attentiveness that I receive now. For the first time, I feel like a doctor is actively seeking to ways to help me improve and get the pain and how it impacts my life to a realistically manageable level and curb as much of it as possible rather than just throwing medications at me or giving me very general tips like ""exercise this way and not that way, try a chiropractor, get regular massages, etc."" and instead suggests individualized and targeted advice and treatment. I never felt like I was truly being listened to when I expressed how I was feeling physically and how much my life was being negatively impacted until now, and I'm beyond grateful that I finally found a doctor who carefully listens and seems to genuinely care. There's likely not going to be one quick fix for everything for me, and figuring it all out and navigating effective treatment takes time and requires patience, but I trust a doctor for one of the first times ever and don't feel as though I just have to resign to pain and how my issues negatively impact me, and dont feel like I just have to accept ""bandaid treatment.""

Many reviews I read about doctors in general seemingly imply only one or a few visits - though I understand that sometimes one just knows whether a doctor is right for them or not, more often than not, a little patience is required, and I strongly, strongly encourage someone to not give up quickly. Doctors don't have magic wands and have to figure out the best course of action - they're essentially piecing a sometimes complicated puzzle together and it can take time. I've been seeing Dr. Estrada a little over a year now and am beyond satisfied.

Dr. Lee is fantastic, patient, kind and supportive of my choices when it comes to my choice of treatment plan.|I've been a patient here for the last two years and I have had nothing but great experiences here, I don't think that I could come up with one negative or bad thing about this clinic and the amazing and professional staff and doctors that I've seen.  The environment is so friendly and the staff always acknowledge and are aware that there are patients there, they continue to always update us if for some reason our appointment time is going to be slightly delayed when most clinics that I go to or have been to will normally never keep the patients updated, majority of the time I would have to go to the front desk and ask what's going on because my appointment time  was 30+ minutes passed and no one had told me anything about why I haven't been seen yet. I think one of the worst things to happen at any clinic is to show up early to your appointment as required by the clinic and then you are not seen for over an hour and a half or longer only to find out that the doctor was eating breakfast/lunch or not even there and when you were finally seen your time with the doctor was 5 to 10 minutes.  I understand that things happen but when you are not updated to why you have been waiting so long past your appointment time and it's not just the one time here and there but happens continuously as if the patients time is not valued or important to the doctor or staff.  At this clinic I have never had this problem or seen any other patients have this problem which is a blessing and tells us that our time is valued and important to the doctor and staff.  Thank you for being a clinic that cares about their patients.|ASAP is a great pain management facility! I have been to couple different pain management doctors and by far DR. Lee is the best out of these doctors that I have been a patient of! He definitely does take time to listen to you, As well he gets all of the medical documents and all the flims... Meant x-rays CT scans MRIs..all the test that you have had. He does his absolute best to get a full picture of what all is going on inide your body. If your like me and have been to a few PM doctors, then you definitely know  that it seems like most of the Doctors treat you like your just another number, don't take time to listen to all you have to say, let alone to get all of your pervious medical documents and test! Most PM doctors don't seem like they care about you as patient. Seems like they just try to get you in and out in 5 minutes! Alot of pain management doctors offices only give the Doctor 3 minutes per patient... And that's not right at all! It's all about booking as many patients as they can a day per doctor, all about getting as much money as they can everyday. That is ok if your a established patient and it's just a quick follow up, But not for a new patient...need to take time to find everything out a the patients so they actually can help with the pain management!

Shanbhag a spine and pain specialist.  He has such an impressive broad experience in this field.  Anyone with a spine  and pain condition should give the National Spine And Pain  Centers a call. (703-738-4371).  He is definitely a top notch doctor.

Also I want to say his nurses and receptionist are very professional as well.  They make you feel welcome the moment you arrive at the office.

Marsha Campbell|I have been Dr. Shanbag's patient for 4 years and has always received great care! He and his staff ensure that my health concerns are fully addressed. They are very courteous, understanding, and approachable.|I gotta say! I am so glad I went to see Dr. Shanbhag. I have been experiencing lower back pain due to a protruding disk.
I never thought there could be anything out here to ease or stop the pain I was experiencing, or the physical lost of some movements I use to be able to do freely, such as bending down, over, or stooping.
After seeing Dr. Shanbhag, I have regained those movements again. He's absolutely wonderful in the care that he gives while being funny at the same time. I am painless Thanks to Dr. Shanbhag.|I have been a patient at the Woodbridge location for many years now. Dr. Shanbag and his team have provided me with procedures related to lower back and shoulder pain. They are awesome and I highly recommend them for anyone hoping to find an alternative treatment for pain in lieu of surgery.|Welcome to National Spine & Pain Centers of Woodbridge, where they take cleanliness and security as seriously as they take your pain relief--and apparently, their stand-up comedy!

First off, don't expect to just waltz in here unannounced. This place has Fort Knox-level security! Need to use the restroom? Better have a golden ticket--or at least Jackie's approval from the front desk, because those doors are LOCKED. Try to sneak in and see how quickly Jackie turns into a bouncer, albeit a very polite one with a winning smile.

Now, speaking of Jackie, this guy could moonlight as a diplomat for all the practice he's getting trying to pronounce my name. You'll see him blush (quite a sight, actually) every time he gives it a shot. But don't worry, he's quick to recover and handles all the paperwork like a pro.

Then there's Dr. Ashish Shanbhag, who's basically doing a stand-up routine while fixing my spine. Is it a distraction tactic? Maybe. But somehow, between his zingers and ""Dad jokes,"" I realized the treatment had wrapped up before I even noticed he'd started! I wouldn't be surprised if he's got a secret life at open-mic nights around town.

Balancing out Dr. Shanbhag's comedy act is the ever-serene Ms. Yvonne. She doesn't say much, but when she does, it's like a calming presence straight from a meditation app. Plus, she's in charge of the numbing--so, trust me, she's essential.

In all seriousness, this place has it all: cleanliness, safety, efficiency, and an oddly humorous vibe. It's like going to a comedy club where you leave feeling less pain and more secure. Thanks, National Spine & Pain Centers--Woodbridge, VA. I think I'll be back...but for the laughs as much as the treatment!|I went to see Dr. Shanbhag today for the first time. I must say I think I have found mine and my family's new Spine Care Specialist. He was very informative, knowledgable, and I left with no unanswered question. My daughter was with me and she felt he answered her questions without her having to ask. Every issue I had was addressed and was told if I thought of anything afterwards I could reach out. This has been a long journey for me and I feel like I will finally get some relief and on the road to feeling better! Prayerfully. Thank you Dr. Shanbhag!!!!|I love going to the National Spine &Pain Center in Woodbridge. The entire staff is great! Dr.Shanbhag is so funny. No matter how much pain I am in he makes me laugh.

When I was referred to see the pain specialist within the practice I was scheduled quickly and with out issue.

His staff has all been on point and very helpful.  Highly recommend!!|Well I have been seen by P.A.

They make sure you feel comfortable and make sure that you feel confident in yourself with the step that you're making to get help. The staff also brings a smile to my face anyways because of their kindness and generosity. I think people should try this doctor because the doctor and their staff members are genuinely nice, truly an influence and really about their work.|My experience here was great at first, but then it all went very wrong. I eventually got my pain under control with a very helpful doctor, but then 2 days before my appointment I get a letter saying I was dismissed from their practice. I was just very confused. I had got a tooth pulled and got another prescription. I called to let them know before my Mother had went to drop off the paper to pharmacy and the lady told me she would let the 2 girls know. I tried to call and explain to them that I had informed them that I got a different prescription and they very extremely rude saying they went over the contract with me. However I was given a piece of paper told to read and initial it. I was not told if I got a different prescription I was supposed to bring it in to the practice. On paper it says to notify them. Well I did notify them and when explained to them again they were very rude yet again to me. Now I am stuck trying to find a different pain management. So now I suffer due to lack of communication between the people at that office. And the sad part is I really did like and communicate well with my doctor.|I had a positive experience.  Straight and to the point, explained procedures, everything as expected, very accommodating.  Kind of long wait, but understandably so having just recently replacing all but 1 employee. Nice to see a friendly face. All in all rather pleased.
I must say equally I have been with Tabitha and her staff as swell. They were family and made me always feel welcome. Tabitha really did have your best in mind and heart. Will miss her as well.|I was just recently discharged from the pain clinic after being there 3 years. It's a long and complicated situation that caused my discharge and even though I told the complete truth about what happened, I still violated my contract. Tabitha Garrison and the nursing staff and front desk were all wonderful people and helped me with my pain and I'm very thankful for them. Whenever someone gets discharged, they are quick to blame everyone except themselves. I created my situation and I got myself put out, just me! Thanks again for all the great help guys!!|Please don't waste your time here!  Every single time I had an appointment over the course of several months, I waited no less than an HOUR past each appointment time.  The doctor only visits this practice once a month from Maryland.  The one time I was scheduled to actually see him I waited TWO HOURS & still never got to see him!!!  They are nothing but pushers!  I take ONE med, yet every time I go they try to push another drug on me! I've been driving 35 minutes to this clinic.  No more!  I finally found another pain management practice closer to me where I can actually get an appointment & be seen in a normal amount of time.  I'd actually rather suffer the pain than deal with this place!  Extremely unprofessional & could care less about my time or my needs!!!|It's always a pleasant experience when I visit the clinic. Everyone is so nice and able to answer my questions. They are knowledgeable when it comes to my concerns and overall a great group of people. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in need of a good practice to go to.|I have only been to this location 3 times to date but they are always helpful and professional. They have worked with all my health pains and that is not very easy since I have already had my esophagus removed due to cancer. And now have other pain issues with my spine and back. I will say however they need to be more active to make a covid-19 social distant waiting area and disenfect it frequently while open. Other than that I would recommend them.|The medical personnel are very efficient but also very personable. They are quick but allow one to ask questions and even chat to give some context to these questions. I was uncertain in these pandemic times how to deal with five or more of us sitting for an hour or more waiting together in a small waiting room.

Not only is she uncaring but notes the exact opposite of what's going on.  You won't find any in of my doctors notes. She has never examined me or touche me to examine all she does sit typing on her computer. I appreciate her not wanting or asking if I need opioid but a pain shot was to much to ask for. When you're in terrible pain and the only thing wants to set u up to do is get an injection . No other options from her. No other help. She is in pain management  your there bc ur in pain.|HORRIBLE experience! Dr. Painter has no sympathy. I was already in tears when she walked in the room from being in horrible pain and she could care less. Said she couldn't help me until I lost weight. ( Understandable, BUT) I told her I wish I had known about the BMI issue all this time that I had been waiting for the appointment so I could've been working on it and I felt like I wasted my time. She replied "" what, you want your money back? Did u pay any money today""? She had no bedside manners and was so blunt and cold. It's like she could care less. She typed in her computer for basically my primary doctor to deal with me about the pain. The nurses and staff there were so nice and supportive. I don't see how they put up with her. I've waited months for this appointment just to be treated like this. She shouldn't be a Dr in my opinion.|I had an appointment last Friday, 9/23/22, with Dr. Booth to get a much needed caudal before leaving for vacation.  She was 7 patients behind so I waited 3 hours to get in.  Then she refused to give me my caudal stating that I questioned what medication I was getting and because she touched the side of by back near my bra line and I 'jumped'.  I am very ticklish and when my husband touches my back I jump.  I recently moved here from PA and one of her comments to me was ""Well you're not in PA anymore"".  My understanding was she had 5 more patients to see and it was already 2:30 pm.|I wish that I could put less than one star!! Michelle Painter is horrible!! My daughter who is the sweetest, hardest working person and has been in misery for months waited from the end of December until late February, the whole time in intense pain to the point that she had to quit both of her jobs, for her appointment with her to try to get some relief. She has a serious kidney disease that made her have to take steroids that contributed to a lot of weight gain and Michelle walked in and just bruskly announced that she could not do the procedure because her BMI was 1 point too high and put her off for another 4 months. She had an outright nasty demeanor and my daughter was already in tears before she saw her due to the pain that she was in and her being outright mean did not help. It was bad enough to be turned away like that and she did not deserve the meanness. All she wants is for the pain to stop so that she can go back to work and properly care for her little family. Nasty Michelle has apparently never suffered any intense pain and I bet that one day karma is gonna show her what it feels like!! My daughter showed up at my house in tears over this and it infuriates me that someone could be so callous toward her. Shame on you Michelle!!!|I had an appointment with Michelle Painter NP today and she was awful. When she first entered the room she acted like she didn't want to be there. She asked me if I had any questions once she was done, I asked her if surgery was likely within the next year or two and she scoffed as if l wasn't hurting enough to bother with me. The ""in-between"" conversation was not any better. Pain management was my last resort after being in pain for over 5 years. I have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia and I DO NOT want pain medicine.
On the other hand, her nurse and the ladies at the front desk were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and accommodating. I was actually debating if I would go through with the epidural she wanted to do, but after reading the reviews for Dr. Booth I went ahead and scheduled the epidural.
I have to say my first experience with pain management was not a good one!!!|Dr Booth is very caring. In my experience she does what she thinks is best for your needs. She may not write pain meds but she tries other ways to help you. I'm very grateful for Dr B.|Although I didn't like the process they put my dad through because of his insurance.. the  injection helped my dad alot.im leaving 4 stars because they needed to have my dad's doctor change the meds he is on.|If I could give them a zero I would.

We were both super pleased with entire experience.
Office is beautiful and comfortable.  Check-in process quick and efficient.
We did not wait for more than a few minutes and were called back.
Questions asked and vitals taken. Tyler came in very promptly.  He was personable and pleasant- very informative.  Listened to our concerns and questions . Had a plan for pain management and they were able to work a time to get this done quickly and to our satisfaction.
I wish all doctor's offices could work this efficiently and be able to get a procedure done this quickly.
Very satisfied.|Dr Ung and Arun Sun, his PA, are both excellent!! I started seeing Dr Ung after an injury at work - I went through 3 years of workman's comp terrible treatment!
Workers comp told me there was nothing they could do except pain medication and I took 75mg (SEVENTY FIVE!!) of oxycodone a day for over 2 1/2 years!! It lost its effectiveness and I literally tried to end it all But Dr Ung found the problem and treated it and I no longer take opioids!!!
And about 8 months ago I started having a different problem- before even having the MRI, Arun described what she thought it might be and she was correct! It took a few minor procedures but the pain is mostly gone!
They respond quickly - I can message thru the MyChart system and get a response in less than 24 hours! They've even moved appointments up when I'm having trouble and don't feel like I can wait!!
I highly recommend them!! And most of the staff in their office are great and have been with the practice for years!!|Dr Ung has done wonders for my pain. Being back pain free for the past year has been a blessing. I also had neck pain that he has under control. He is professional yet caring as a physician.|Dr. Ung is truly amazing. He tells you step by step during the procedures. You know what is being done and what you should feel. He is such a calming presence. He takes his time and will answer any questions. You never feel rushed or unimportant. And he relieves your pain! A tremendous asset to his practice is the lady that helps with his procedures! She is ALWAYS up beat, sweet, and kind. Amazing Doctor and assistant!!!|Dr. Ung and his office staff are the kindest and most caring around. From the beginning of the procedure to the end, Dr. Ung shows compassion.

To heal my back he used a combination of chiropractic and acupuncture treatments. To restore my hearing he used acupuncture. Dr. Rhyu has amazing medical skills and is very generous and caring toward his patients. I would highly recommend him for anyone looking for the best in medical care.|Although I've been to other acupuncturists, chiropractics, and other clinics before, the doctors here were the most friendly and personal. They were able to relate my physical conditions to everyday life, and my life at that, and they were able to recommend changes that I could make to my life in order to maintain a healthier body. I have a herniated disc and so they gave me nutritional help, massages, and acupuncture and also made sure to ask if I was alright during every session. They were also able to inform me of what a herniated disc was and how I might have gotten it.|Dr Rhyu is FANTASTIC!  Super friendly, personable and highly skilled with acupuncture.  The best part for me is just getting inspired by how much he has accomplished!  He treated Michael Jordan in the early 90s, has owned Lamborghinis, has worked for the US Olympic team as the team acupuncturist, lectured at Harvard University, is the author of many books, procured and refines his own herbal tonics which he sells at his office ( mental master and sleep are my favorites).  I have to put a period because the list goes on lol!  He is a certified KUNG FU master from Beijing, former doctor of Samsungs Medical Center in Korea, former actor in Korea, has successfully saved people from committing suicide (jumping off an infamous bridge in Seoul), owns the Guiness World Record for longest Yoga class at Wanderlust Festival, owns a shoe company in Italy and many many more.  MAIN POINT - he is not your average doctor!  Unlike most of the medical industry - he advocates natural medicine and is a FORCE to be RECKONED with and the bonus is that he actually listens to his patients and if you dare listen to his stories you will be inspired too!|This place is amazing and Dr. Rhyu is helping save my life. I noticed a difference the very first day I met him. It's remarkable what he has done for me and I would highly recommend him to anyone. His place of business is warm and welcoming. Words can not express my gratitude that I have for him and this place. Thank You,  Thank You,  Thank You!|I do acupressure with a great Dr but it's a bit far. I decided to try someone closer to home. I made an appointment with Dr Paul Rhyu in Reston at 12:30. I arrived at 12:20 so I can fill the paperwork. No one was in the office front desk, five minutes later I see an oriental man leaving the office and I assumed he is a patient. It was Dr Paul going to lunch. At 12:50 some staff started arriving but no one acknowledged me.  I called the Dr at 1:00 and he told me that he is on his way. To make a long story short, he didn't apologize, did my acupressure with all my clothes on, sweater, t-shirt, Jeans, socks and on top of that a blanket. When I said that I never heard of any massage fully clothed, I was told that it is ok in winter!!! He kept asking if I'm in pain? Helloo, under all those layers? How can I feel anything? I was done in 40mns, when I said that my massage is suppose to be an hour, I was told that they consider 40mns a full session.

I was really worried and stressed out about seeing a new pain doctor and a new spine center after many many years of being treated on the West Coast.

The office was easy to find and I didn't wait long to see Dr Cherrick. He was fantastic and helped me calm down and relax. Like many pain doctors he is super busy juggling many balls in the air but he is a master of handling a million things at once. He was clear and concise about my role as a patient which I really appreciated. I felt I understood everything.

I can't tell you how relieved I was to know I would be in the hands of a well known doctor who understood me. Tomorrow is my second appointment. Im looking forward to seeing Dr Cherrick again.|I can't express how happy I've been with the Alexandria office. I originally saw Dr. Cherrick many years ago for chronic lower back pain. He listened and got me on a pain management program. But the Physician's Assistants are the ones I particularly want to thank. I've suspected that I had fibromyalgia for years and been ignored and pushed off by numerous doctors to the point that I stopped trying to get help until it got to be too much again.  I got up the nerve to mention it to Nadia at my pain management appointment recently and she listened! She started me on the right medication and the difference it has made is amazing. I'm not 100% but my quality of life is much improved and at my latest appointment the PA I met with was also wonderful. (I apologize - I forgot her name).

I never write reviews, but felt that I needed to share how good my experience was with them. Yes, sometimes you have a long wait for appointments and in the waiting room, but I take that as they are taking the needed time with other patients like me and trying to help them too, so I find it worth it.|Dr. Abraham Cherrick is a 5 star professional literally,

He made me feel at home....|I HAD been coming to Dr. Cherrick for over a year. He prescribed me Relistor to take once a day but he said it was supposed to be written 3X a day which is why it was not working. He rushes with everything he does! Not paying attention to detail. I am really appalled, hurt, and disappointed because, as I was sitting in the patient room I opened the door to see what was taking him so long and I overheard him talking about me to another colleague!! He called me a ""Crazy Lady"" and spoke of how he was dreading to come back in the room. So, once he  came back, I confronted him about it, I proceeded to tell him my ears do not lie and be sure to close his door before talking about his patients! I walked out and told him I do not want to be seen by him or anyone in this practice. I can trust him with my health when he laughs about his patients right in the other room!!!! He does not care about his clients he just wants to hold you in a room for an hour to be able to bill your insurance. I am awaiting my refund from the billing department. Thank you, Hailey for helping me!  I am waiting my refund of my $25.00 Co-Pay as we did not conclude our appointment. I wonder what the bill will include since I walked out??|This doctor is awesome: High energy personable care; very intelligent; extremely funny; when the office visit is over you'll feel you've got a powerful ally in your corner.

I really loved his PA as well; her name is Sarah, and she has a talent in listening to you well, and determining where you hurt and what makes it happen. You almost feel like she feels your pain with you. She is very good at conveying this information to Dr. Cherrick. She finds out what and where, he knows why and how to fix it. They are a good team.|I have seen several doctors for a problem with my dominant hand. I have a mixed bag of symptoms and kept getting passed from specialist specialist. I saw Dr. Cherrick today and he took lots of time asking me a plethora of questions to figure out what may be causing my problem.

I have already taken the last of my pain medication and the new doctor won't give me a prescription without the Discharge Notice from Dr Cherrick. So I guess I'll have to find some way to tide me over for the next 2 weeks.

I received multiple trigger point injections in my neck and shoulders over several years.. Great relief. I also received a number of  guided sciatic injections, which helped immensely. Of course opioid use for pain was not taboo, then so my pain management for migraines, chronic back,   sciatica, and neck and shoulder pain were very well managed. I only left the practice because of loss of insurance and then a move to Florida.  I do plan on returning to him now that I am back in Virginia Beach.|I went in for a SI Injection and immediately the pain hit me when I tried to sit up. Blood pressure dropped and he had to put a wet rag on my face and neck. Said it was the numbing medicine is why I reacted this way. I had to sit for 10 minutes and he told me to walk like a Pirate. That weekend I ended up in the ER because the pain was unbearable and I could barely walk. Its 10 days later and the pain is still horrible! I cant get in with a Neuro Surgeon until the 29th. I'm sure its NERVE DAMAGED because I took Gabapentin that I had on hand and it and it seemed it took the edge off the pain. This place is a shot clinic and the only thing he had to go off of was a X-Ray. Never took any precaution with inserting the needles. The MRI from the ER showed I had a underlying severe spine issue! Don't you think he should of required testing prior to the injection or at least taken precaution with fluoroscopy or ultrasound to guide him safely through the Injection.|Warning! Do not go to this place unless you want to be dropped like a hot potato. After going to this place for at least 4 years, I was sent to Abby Barney to get injections in both my shoulders due to torn rotator cuffs. Prior to that, I had seen Bonnie n o c k. I never saw Robert spears. Lisa in the front desk always real sweet to me a month ago I went to Abby Barney and she gave me an injection in my left shoulder, and I was to come back in a few weeks for the injection in my right shoulder, which is worse. When I called to make the appointment for the injection in my right shoulder, Lisa told me I could not come back there. I asked her why that was, you have missed three appointments with us since you started coming 6 years ago I couldn't believe what she was saying I asked her could she give me the dates of the appointments that I had missed and she refuse to do that, and she hung up on me I then call back nicely and asked her to give me the dates again, and she got very very rude and told me not to call again. I told her that I was supposed to come back for my right shoulder and that the was excruciating but she did not care it all, tell me not to call again, and she hung up I waited a few minutes and I called again to ask her what had I done wrong. She told me nothing, but I had already been discharged she said. I told her that I needed an injection in my right shoulder as I was in extreme pain and could hardly use my arm period ask her if I could speak to Abby Barney or to Robert Spears and she said no I could not and slam the phone down on me. I was in tears and I am still in excruciating pain and I do not know what to do to do that was very cruel, heartless, and uncaring way to treat a patient like me chronic pain and I have very bad arthritis since Abby Barney had all my MRIs and the ones of my shoulders, she knew where to inject her concoction into my shoulders she had done it three or four times in the past, so I don't know why this Lisa was so rude and yelled at me that I missed three appointments and would not tell me when. I told Lisa that I had covid-19 and that I was in the hospital the first time for 6 weeks and I called and canceled it, then I got it again after Thanksgiving and was hospitalized for 2 weeks and I see you, CU unit do not call when you are in there. I explained all that to her and she could care less. She still would not tell me the dates you did was yell at me and say you have been discharged to talk to who was in charge she would not let me. Prior to that I told her pay money that I if I owe something I would pay it, anything. Even though I don't know why she did this to me she had me in tears by then my pain flew up my blood pressure went up I had to call my cardiologist at CVA he said that he would try to call the head of the company which would be Dr Speer I think and tell him directly that the chronic pain I have makes my blood pressure go very very high and I could have a stroke is am I'm not on any pain meds and now they were refusing me a shot. He told me to call or notify you to send me all records from beginning to end and why you discharged me and whatDates dates did I miss.

Dr. Spears is a really nice doctor and human being, but I will make it clear that he does not do anything with meds - so if you're looking for help there, go to another practice.  It's all alternative treatments.   I received trigger point injections from a physicians assistant.   Time will tell if they help.   - Amy|Quick, easy and Dr. Spear is very kind and personal as is everyone in his office.|Dr. Robert Spear is the very best you will find in a doctor as well as a pain management physician.  I have seen him for many years and the truth is, I can ask him about anything (except dermatology) and he actually knows the answer.  He's a 'healer' in my book and those are rare.

And his office staff is always friendly and personable.

I had 2 surgeries identical back to back because if the negligence of a surgeon. This pain facility would not help me because I was on 15 other prescriptions. They were all prescribed from my horrible experience at Carillon and was told that they would only help me if I discontinued medication for my anxiety and depression. All of my symptoms were brought on by me almost dieing. So Carillon can burn to the ground. I would die before ever being treated by any medical persons affiliated with this money hungry, Unprofessional, poor excuse of any of their multiple facilities.
They also had quite the paychecks during the Corona Virus or rather government disease. I personally know young and older nurses who were paid a huge amount of funds to improperly document death certificates even if it was not a fatality due to covid.  The facilities were paid a very large sum to all hospitals nationwide and could only receive payment if a death was caused by the Corina virus.

I was apprehensive given the low reviews,  but perhaps people had different hopes and expectations than I did. I'm very happy with my first appt, and I'll update this review if that changes.|I have read these so called complaints from others.
If you're prescribed a medication and it doesn't help it's just the wrong one for your body chemistry not that a doctor gave you the wrong medication. If a doctor doesn't listen to you then make yourself known , make them listen to you or ask for a different doctor.

I DEFINITELY WOULD recommend him to others.|The doctor I seen told me he didn't care if my arm was falling off he would never give me narcotics.

I saw Osa Emohare, who dismissed me and never even listened to a word i said. He lied straight to my face about things he wrote in my file, which i found out from another doctor. When i asked him why he wrote this stuff in my file, he lied to my face again, and told me he didn't do it. I'm currently in the middle of using FOIA to get his notes that he wrote on me so i can file a proper complaint with Carilion. He set my follow-up appointment 3 months after the first one, and when i called about a month later to say the medicine he prescribed me was affecting my mood, could i please move my appointment, he said no. Then acted as if i were only calling to get drugs. Would not look me in the eye and could not get out a complete sentence without interjecting ""ummm"" multiple times. He acted as if my pain isn't real, although you can see in my chart that i broke my neck and ended up with a bone infection in my spine. If anyone refers you to see this ""doctor"", please run the other way.|If I could give this place a negative star I would.

The second time they told me it got denied something about the docs had to discuss something. Sounds like An excuse after another. I know they have no control over my insurance getting denied but they have control of making appointments. That's right they scheduled my appointments for me to go to.

Can you add I just got Kelly's name from front desk.

Sure! Here's the updated version with that detail added:

Subject: Concerns Regarding Appointment Communication and Handling

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent handling of my upcoming appointment at [Doctor's Office Name].

Three days ago, I received a voicemail stating that my appointment would need to be rescheduled due to weather-related office closures on Friday. However, when I reached out to my case nurse this morning, I was told the office would actually be open and that I was expected to attend as originally scheduled.

This conflicting information left me uncertain about whether I should keep the appointment. It wasn't until I reached out to my case manager for clarification that I was told I needed to show up, even though the office had initially communicated otherwise.

To make matters worse, I received a call from the office manager, Kelly Wood, late in the evening, just hours before my appointment, insisting that I attend. Instead of offering clarity, the manager's tone was unprofessional and confrontational. When I attempted to ask for her name during the call, she abruptly hung up on me while I was still speaking, which I found incredibly disrespectful.

I was finally able to get Kelly's name from the front desk, and I am deeply disappointed by her lack of professionalism. Additionally, when I mentioned my concern about how my case was being handled, Kelly blamed her staff for not knowing that I am under workers' compensation. This was troubling to hear, as many of their patients are likely under workers' compensation, and I would expect that my case should be familiar to the office staff. She also stated that she would not apologize for any mistakes they had made, which only added to my frustration.

If the office knew the weather would not affect operations, I believe they should have communicated this much earlier, rather than leaving me to chase down answers. The lack of professionalism and the dismissive attitude from Kelly has been deeply disappointing.

On a positive note, I have no complaints about Dr. Khan. He has always been kind, humble, and professional, and I truly appreciate the care he provides. However, I would suggest that Dr. Khan consider addressing the behavior of Kelly. If she is unable to communicate effectively with patients or manage situations with professionalism, I don't believe she is suited for a managerial role.

I hope this feedback will be taken seriously to improve future interactions with patients, as this experience has left me questioning the level of care and communication at your practice.|This is a great practice and, in my opinion, the standard of care all speciality facilities should strive to be like. The front staff are always kind, courteous, and helpful. The nurses are thorough and pleasant to talk to. Dr. Kahn's team are a nice, funny, and caring. Every procedure has been easy from scheduling to follow up. I've had 10 procedures here and I'm beyond satisfied. Great practice, great staff, well done.|If I could give this office 0 stars I would. Every single time my husband has an apt the Dr or nurses run an 1 hour 2 hours behind for a 20 minute procedure with no communication as to what is going on. This place sucks, the staff is rude. I would recommend going to another Spine and Pain center. This office is so unorganized. Good luck getting them to answer your calls.|I'd been in excruciating pain over a year with Ortho VA. My PCP directed me to IPPS. The knowledge and care and time put in by C. CdeBaca and Dr. Kahn saved my life when I wanted to be euthanized. Ordered am MRI to cover exact areas he suspected. I have scoliosis. He determined herniated disc and arthritis. I agreed to injections and I was afraid. Every visit I am well informed on all treatment plans and procedures. Very caring manner as if I am the only patient. I'm grateful for the entire staff.|They don't respect your time .Your appt time means nothing to them thinking about leaving|I have been trying to contact the office on numerous occasions to ensure I get paid, they do not answer the phone whatsoever. I was also fired after communicating with management TWO hours before my scheduled time that my boyfriend's car battery was dead. After even having proof of communicating with management, I was told it would make no difference and I was let go. Sad there is no understanding for simple things that can occur to anybody in every day life. This office is so quick to fire people that now they don't even have an adequate number of employees to even answer the phone for regular patients. Other than not trying to be understanding to hardships, I did enjoy my time there. But I truly do not believe it is okay for any employer to disregard an employee completely when they have done all the necessary things to ensure everyone was in the loop about what was going on. Especially something as simple as a car battery not starting, if you felt the need to fire me over a car battery not starting then someone could have offered to pick me up if that was such an issue, but that wasn't discussed either. Just immediately terminated me.|My husband and i just spent 2 hours there for a 20 min procedure. After he was finished, I asked him who was his Dr. He said Dr. Khan. At that time I realized that it was the same doctor that was walking around recording on his phone instead of treating my husband. The appt was at 12:40, my husband was called back at 1:00, he was texting me while he was in the room, and I finally walked to the window at 2:00 at which point the lovely lady I spoke to went to check on him. They finally took him back, rushed the procedure according to my husband, and rolled him out. This was absolutely unacceptable. I guess websites and social media are more important than the patients.|I have been seeing Dr Khan for about 14 years? I can't believe the posts about the wait time as he and his staff try so very hard to help everyone.  Dr Khan takes TIME with you in the room answers every question.  That's why there's a wait and it's so worth it. He helped me, my hubby, my son, my mom and my mother in law who all loved him I have sent many of my friends to him.  So yea if you want someone who cares see him. And we all should know by now since COVID finding staff is difficult. So try to have some patience, make notes before your appointments.",2025-02-21|2024-12-06|2024-11-12|2024-11-09|2024-12-10|2023-03-21|2023-02-02|2023-01-23,1|5|1|5|2|1|1|5,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",87.2|76.4|76,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJizsL8wEHsYkRDnsi4BQPBuA,50

He took time to explain my situation in every detail,  which includes what I need to do if I have a flare, and I probably will have more, but he prepared me a plan in (5) simple steps, I couldn't ask for more.  He is professional, compassionate, mannerism is beyond measures, very thorough and very kind.   I am in good hands, this is just how he has made me feel.

Very good at managing my lower back pain. His procedures are quick and he is doing his best for the procedures to be as painless as possible. His front desk staff and nurses are always helpful, professional and kind. Highly recommend.|Without Dr Kendall, I know I would be using a walker by now. Between my SI joint, a couple of lumbar disc herniations and a 10/10 painful sciatica, I will never be able to express enough gratitude for the help of Dr Kendall and staff. I do not need surgery as long as pain is managed. My ortho surgeon, Dr Childs, even said that I was in great hands with Dr Kendall and to continue to follow his recommendations.
I literally go from not being able to walk up stairs to surfing and hiking. I am so happy with my treatment from this office. I have to be diligent to do MY part with stretching, exercising, and staying ahead of the pain, but I guarantee that if you do your part he will do his.|Chop shop that treats patients like an assembly line. Gave me a medial branch block without a steroid, which is normally used as a test run for a lumbar rhizotomy, when I thought I was getting a steroid shot.

There was a huge failure in communication  about the procedure and no explanation of what injections were being given, what to expect afterward, nor any follow up.

Super unprofessional and unbelievable that I was given a completely different treatment than what I had requested, without my consent. I went an entire month thinking I had been given a steroid shot (because that was what we originally discussed) and that it hadn't worked, before seeing in the official paperwork that a completely different procedure was performed on my back.

This is medical malpractice and I honestly feel violated and incredibly upset that this occurred.|Dr. Kendall is absolutely the BEST, he takes his time setting you at ease  right before the procedure. I've been his patient since May 2019 with really bad lower back issues and it is steadily getting better. His staff works like a team, from the front desk to the nurses and the check out associates they are all on the ball and very helpful. The office is spotless and very welcoming. I am very happy with the care this practice delivers. They go out of their way to help their patients in every way. Don't go anywhere else!|I'm not pleased at all with this office! I originally booked an appointment with Dr. Kendall and arrived to the office at my scheduled time but he didn't even come see me. He left me to the nurse practitioner (who was wonderful by the way but that doesn't change the fact that my original appointment was with Dr. Kendall and he didn't even make an appearance. Moreover the front desk woman took 5 min to even acknowledge that I'm standing there waiting to be checked in (even though I observed that with the next 5 patients she immediately attended to them). It's possible that she might have been trying to finish something up when I was waiting but she still could have said something simple like ""I'll be with you shortly"" instead of completely ignoring me for a good 5-10 min. Finally, as I was checking out I asked why I wasn't seen by Dr. Kendall despite my appointment being with him and the receptionist told me this is normal for first visits since that's when they ask for tests or Xrays only but in future visits, I should see him. However, when I called to move my follow up appointment (which is supposed to be with Dr. Kendall as per my original app. and as per the receptionist) I was told that my app. is with the Nurse and not with Dr. Kendall at all. So it seems like they just switched me to being a patient of the nurse practitioner and not the doctor at all without telling me even though I specifically requested to be seen by the doctor and moreover gave me wrong info on my way out making it seem like I'm still his patient but that he will start seeing me once we go into the actual treatment. I want to reiterate that the Nurse practitioner who saw me was fabulous (Dr. Charles, Lowe) but it's really unprofessional of the office to just switch my provider without my consent when I originally came in for Dr. Kendall who I obviously chose for a reason.

Even using their app isn't convenient as you cannot make edits to your appointment or changes to the time and all in all nothing about my visit was satisfactory except Nurse Lowe herself.|""Dr. Kendall is an extraordinary healer who has completely transformed my life. For over 20 years, I battled with chronic back pain until I found Dr. Kendall. With his compassionate care and remarkable expertise, he performed what can only be described as a miracle. Thanks to Dr. Kendall, I have been blissfully pain-free for the past decade. His dedication to his patients knows no bounds, and I am forever grateful for his unwavering support.

The process from start to finish for each appointment is super easy and fluid. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seen for my appointment.

Dr Chen and Dr Wheeler are both phenomenal. Dr Wheeler is who I see, and he is always very compassionate, patient, knowledgeable, and truly cares about his patients. He has great recommendations for ways to treat pain, which I have promptly tried every device or advice he has provided to me. Every time, they work! He talks to you like you are a person, not like many other pain clinics out there. There is no judgment.

You are not FORCED to go through procedures like some other clinics, especially if you have already gone through most of those procedures, some of them often. You're not required to do urine drug tests every single month if you are stable on your meds and follow all the rules of the pain contract.

Their billing is transparent and accurate. I love that you can do most appointments virtually. Yes, the phone calls rarely get answered, but they are easy to contact via the online portal.

Bottom line, I would recommend these providers 100%|After 20 years of being over medicated and nothing else I finally found Dr. Wheeler.

I'd recommend them!
I've been going there for 4 yrs now, and happy with them.|I was welcomed very warmly by the clinic staff.  I was still finishing my paperwork when I arrived and they were very kind to help me finish and start processing what I had already finished.  Dr. Hillyer was extremely knowledgeable in everything I am experiencing in my back and leg.  I felt very confident in the treatment process we discussed.|Peninsula Pain Clinic was disappointing. After my consulation, they lost my paperwork for contacting my insurance and getting an injection approved and scheduled. Weeks went by without a follow-up. I eventually called them to see what was taking so long just to find out they were doing nothing since my papers were lost. The process off the actual injection was fine, other than it literally did nothing to help my pain. So that was a waste but maybe that's just my personal injury problem. When scheduling the injection, they also scheduled a 2-week follow-up. I felt obligated to go so that I could tell them it didn't work for me. When there, they forgot about me in the exam room for nearly 45 minutes. It was 10 minutes before closing time, so I stepped out to ask what was going on. They seemed bothered that I had the gall to do so and there was a lot of whispering about it. The Advanced Patient Provider that was seeing me seemed especially bothered and also confused as to why I was here for a follow-up. Um, you guys are the ones that scheduled this. I thought it was necessary, I would have gladly not come in, wasting my time and money to tell you guys it didn't work at all. He basically only suggested we try the same exact thing again and didn't seem to care at all that it didn't have any positive effect on my pain. Both times that I thought I was seeing the doctor, I only saw the Advanced Patient Provider. So that's frustrating to have never actually seen or talked to the doctor about my issue. That didn't stop the clinic from billing my insurance as though the appointments were with the doctor. That seems sketchy to me.

Overall, lacking in professionalism, messed up my papers, forgot about me in an exam room, treatment didn't work, and the APP didn't seem to care about my issue. I will not go back and wouldn't recommend it to others based on my experience.|If you are a drug addict this is the place to go. A family member overdosed on Fentanyl (fortunately I found him. Emergency personnel were able to revive him) but they still keep prescribing. I contacted the manager before this most recent overdose to inform them that he was abusing all the pain meds they prescribe (more than one). Nothing changed - they keep issuing him opioids.|I have had a fantastic experience with Dr. Juan, Ms. Bouquet, and the rest of medical team treating me. I have had not one negative experience since starting my treatment at Peninsula Pain Clinic. The staff asked about my lifestyle, diet, medical conditions, and emotional well-being. I have been left with disabling conditions after dealing with rare form of luekemia. In the past, I lived in the southern states and throughout my residency there my medical conditions were either dismissed and/or neglected. Since moving to WA, all of my conditions are being treated and my personal well-being has improved because of medical professionals like the ones at PPC. They are well educated in their fields and the staff has true empathy for every individual that comes through the clinic. Being proactive with my health concerns and listening to the advice of my doctors/nurses has had a remarkable improvement mentality and physically.

Insurance can be messy and tricky place to navigate. The staff will do their best to work with your insurance plan or come up with a financial plan best suited for your budget. They are very reasonable. I am still disabled, however I can better cope with the chronic pain with their treatment options and compassionate staff. I will continue my treatment at this clinic for years to come.|My intake visit was last week. I was very impressed by: a) the new patient forms emailed to me could be filled in on my PC b) the receptionist was friendly & efficient c) wait time was minimal d) clinical staff were great, especially Kelly (ARNP) e) I feel confident in my plan's next steps d) facility was spacious and clean e) pleased the doc came in to introduce himself and check on my experience. Suggestion for improvement: too much is left up to the patient to call back and see, e.g., is insurance improved for diagnostic tests? Has the test order gone to medical facility? Was it faxed correctly?  If I hadn't dogged the process it would have been delayed, and when one is in pain, that matters. Please note: I would heartily recommend the Pain Clinic. Everyone can improve.|I have been a patient of Peninsula Pain. Clinic for over twenty years and have always been treated with respect and compassion. I would highly recommend this facility for chronic pain treatment.|I receive EXCELLENT health care at Peninsula Pain Clinic (PPC) on all my visits there.

This past July 2024 I had my R knee ablation done by Inland Pain Specialists not only did not help, I believe damage was done. There is a hard ""mass"" on my knee that was not there before. He inserted  SIX needles for the procedure which I thought was strange as all other knee ablations done were never more than Three. All I know is the ""before and after"" this provider performed the ablation. My knee since this ablation is worse than it has been in several years. It was less painful prior to this ablation!! I will never let anyone except an Orthopedic specialist/MD treat my knee ever!!!|Doc and nurses are great! Very helpful and nice to work with. Took care of my neck problem with one shot!  Gave me great information on everything and got me setup for a good outcome. Will happily go back if needed again!!|I saw JJ and Kala for a knee injury I sustained. They took their time to help me outside of regular business hours.  They closely examined my knee and were both very positive and supportive, talking me through all the options. I highly recommend these two because they are very professional, but the amount of knowledge they have is unlike anything I've ever experienced. Undoubtedly, they were the best choice of medical professionals from whom I could have sought answers. Not only did I feel heard, but I also felt like I was so much more than a dollar sign to them. If I could give them a higher rating, I most certainly would.|Went in to see John for my elbow and had the best experience! The staff was thoughtful and kind and easy to talk to.

Her quality of care is and has been the best I've had.  She's an extremely intelligent Doctor and has also solved a medical issue I've had for years and seen other doctors, specialists etc for.  Just by her and I having a simple conversation that started with her asking how I was doing.  I had a gnarly migraine at an appointment and mentioned for the first time that I've had them pretty constant since a previous neck surgery years earlier.  She right away mentioned that often with the type surgery I had, patients experience migraines.  Wow!  I made a trip to my family doc, he gave me migrain medications and I've been like night and day!  That little conversation, that world of knowledge and her deep care she has for people and patients has helped my life so, so much and truly myself and my family are so thankful she keeps me alive and able to work!  Kelly has also taken great care of me making sure i know what's going on with my insurance stuff and giving me the appointments for the times I need,  she takes care of all that for me then,  I just  pay what she tells me.  She's been wonderful to work with.  Yes, Mount Baker Pain Clinic, the doctors, the staff have been wonderful.  They all have treated me very well!|Very kind and friendly providers and staff. They seem to really care about their patients and worked very hard to help each patient with there own issues. They take care to listen to you and help you in the best way they can.
My experience since starting at Mt Baker has been very positive.b|I have been going to this pain clinic for approximately five years.  I have always been treated with the utmost respect and dignity for a person who suffers daily with chronic pain. The doctor, the receptionist and the nurses all explain the treatments and paperwork in a very professional and understandable language/way.|Kelly And  the doctors are very professional. They are very helpful with my needs for my pain Management.. I am very thankful for the Doctors and staff They are very compassionate. Hannah my primary pain management Doctor. She has always show concern about my pain and given me great direction And help for pain relief. Thank you, Mt Baker, pain clinic.|Front desk team member Kelly is always cheerful and helpful with scheduling, insurance questions and payments.  PAC Hannah always gives me the time I need to review pain issues, medicine adjustments and any other concerns I might have regarding my health.|I've been going to the Smokey Point Clinic for awhile. I have chronic pain, have been on pain meds for years and the only reason why I changed to this place was because I've been having extreme anxiety driving to my other provider. This is the 2nd time that this provider has disregarded my needs to get my meds on time. They use their authority to make you feel like a lying junkie. If you push back and ask questions of certain staff, they ignore you and actually hang up on you! I'm not confrontational. I only take a half pill more frequently so I get a longer lasting relief. My prior doctor never prescribed and set up my next appointment for the day I run out, incase anything comes up he would do a week or more. This doctor thinks that 28 or 30 days you are okay to run out the night before and she'll just give you your next prescription the next day! The last time she knew I would run out 3 days prior to my appointment and refused to give me a few days extension to last. So she knowingly left me to be in pain and to go through withdrawals. Which then you ask yourself, what ever happened to the Hypocratic Oath to do no harm?
I called the pharmacy and asked if the doctor wrote the prescription to be picked up, how early do they refill, they told me up to 2 days prior to the next refill. So the office staff and doctor lied when they said they couldn't do it for the same day it ran out.
I was so hopeful when I first started here because the doctor made me think she was on my side. She said that taking your meds as prescribed I shouldn't feel bad because I'm dealing with chronic pain. We then tried different meds to try to get me off of the narcotics but unfortunately I have allergic reactions to the chemicals in other stuff. Placing me back on the original dosage. I couldn't have been more wrong with thinking this place had my back.
I wasn't going to leave a review. Because then I worried that if this was seen I'd be treated even worse or I would be refused my medication as a punishment. But, others need to know how you'll be treated if you go with them as your pain management clinic. That if you can go down a different path and avoid becoming dependent on narcotics, I can't stress enough that you'll be treated by everyone that you're a lying junkie. You have to do random pee in a cup and have your medication counted like your not an honorable person. You can't drink or do herbal/marijuana substitution for relief or they'll stop your prescription. I don't drink or do anything else so it's no biggie for me. I hope this helps others to try and travel a different path or find a better place to get your relief. I'm stuck now with how bad my neck and back are, the pills barely give relief but without would be a worse nightmare. Take care, find strength from within and don't trust blindly.

Update the next day; I found out from my pharmacy that my prior authorization wasn't filled out fully. The insurance company can't approve my prescription without it. The pharmacy can't let me pay cash for my rx because I'm on Medicaid. The office closed at 4:30 without finishing the authorization and they won't open again until Monday. My regular doctor cannot help because they didn't prescribe the Oxycodone and have never seen me for it. The pharmacy can't help and suggested the ER. My doctor can't help and suggested the ER. Because we don't know how my body will handle the pain and withdrawls after being on this opiod since 2013. I am very angry at this point. All I did was followed what the multiple doctors, surgeons, ect offered as pain relief over the years. My paranoid brain wants to think that because I filled out this review this all happened. But my sanity says to just try to hunker down and breath through the massive anxiety attacks and emotional feelings that are so very strong right now. Once again if you ever are offered opiods as an option for pain relief don't do it! I may not be able to function without pain relief, but at least I wouldn't have all this added on. I just will never leave my bed again. Beyond sad...|I have been trying to get a hold of them for awhile got a referral to go here because I don't drive have been a chronic pain patient for several years and my 1st pain mngmt doc moved to Eastern WA the 2nd 1 we found was in Sea.

Nathan Weins, Dr. Sneddon's PA is my pain management specialist. Most people dread medicinal pain management. A lot of them treat you like a pill seeker or a criminal. Not Nathan and not The Spine Team. Nathan, just like Dr. Sneddon, takes the time to get to know you, hear you out and come up with a plan that works for you and that Nathan is comfortable prescribing pain meds for. Then there's the office ladies. Melissa F, Amber, Bree, Kaitlin, Siera or Siena (I can never remember), Kat and everyone else is just amazing. It's so nice to finally feel like I'm being heard, treated like a person vs just another number and everything is being done without just doping me up and actually feeling like I'm being cared for. I don't feel like I'm just another payment from insurance. Speaking of insurance, the ladies in the office will go to war with insurance companies who get in the way of their client's care. I've witnessed it happen. Everything gets all held up by insurance, Melissa F or Amber make one phone call and suddenly all is well on my end. I could go on and on, writing a novel but I think I've got my point across. If you deal with any spine related pain or are in need of pain management, don't even look anywhere else, just go to The Spine Team and get treated right!|5 Star care!! That is what you will receive at Spine Team in Spokane. I have been a patient for two years now and would never go anywhere else for my Pain Management care.

This appointment was to start treatment plan as discussed & agreed upon with my provider at prior appointment. I went to recieve my first Epidural Steroid Injection. A staff member that's stationed in the surgical department is named Ashley. She was patient, professional, through, openly offered me assistance with  removing clothing garments required, getting into or closing back side of provided gown and post proceedure Ashley offered me any & all assistance I may require getting dressed to go home. Prior to my exiting Ashley was extremely through explaing to me that it's best & wisest to completely fill out the two week record post today's injection. By doing the required completing filling out this record which is to be returned at next two week appointment. Ashley stated the record I do & return does extremely assist the spine team provider members to clearly view what & how the injection effected my pain level, etc! I appreciate the kindness that Ashly displayed towards me. Cya again in another two weeks for follow up appointment!|I love the team at Spine Team Spokane.

I see Mara and her and her team are second to none! I have seen the other provider Nathan while Mara was on vacation. His team was just as pleasant and helpful and kind as Mara and her team! I would highly this place to anyone in need of pain management! Life changing help!!!|I've never experienced a clinic more focused on the money than they are on healthcare than this clinic.

He is kind, caring, concerned and compassionate. I feel I am in trusting care. Thank you!|Dr Bowers is always attentive and he listens and validates my symptoms. In my experience, some doctors have barraged me with questions about my pain and, when you live with pain for a long time, you become desensitised to exactly where the pain is. My MRI might say my pain should only be on my left side, but I experience pain on my right side also, most likely due to my muscles trying to protect and accommodate my limp, ect... Some doctors try to trip you up, because our system is flawed, but Dr Bowers openly discusses the results of my MRIs and he doesn't try to hide information from me. I really appreciate Dr Bowers candor, knowledge, and his willingness to give me the information I need to advocate for myself with the surgeon. When I have questions or need to be seen quickly, I'm able to call and get in, in a reasonable amount of time with one of the doctors, if not Dr. Bowers himself, and that has been very helpful.

He adapts procedures and medicines to provide the best quality of life for his patients.  Highly recommend for folks with chronic pain management needs.|Dr. Bowers has the rare capacity to combine a knowledgeable, no-nonsense approach to treatment with empathy for the patient.  Best way to describe it is that he has a rare balance and optimizes the experience and approach from both an intellectual and emotional angle.  This is probably more philosophical than necessary for a review but he is really quite good, from multiple perspectives.|Dr. Bowers and his entire staff are caring, thoughtful and knowledgeable. He's helped me with both chronic and short term pain management and resolution. I recommend his office to everyone.|We had our first meeting with Dr. Bowers.  You could tell right away that he is extremely knowledgeable and really cares about the patient and wants to do what is best for the patient.

I see Cassie but have also worked with Dr Nowlin as well. Even through this insurance snafu we have been dealing with, as frustrating as it has been for me as a patient and them as a provider. They have been great. Thank you to the entire Mount Baker Pain Clinic staff for everything you do.
Even those behind the scene.. Your work doesn't go unnoticed.

Now if this insurance issue would resolve the issue so we can move forward in our plans to help my pain I would be so very thankful. :)|Overall my experience was great. I believe there was some miscommunication between my provider and myself on the distribution of my pain meds. I believe I heard one thing and the pharmacy got totally different directions when they received my script, about the filling of the script. This is the only reason why I gave the visit a 4 star. Otherwise it would have been a 5. Now I need to call my provider and get things straightened out. To me this is taking time out of my work day to do this which I shouldn't have to do.|I have been a patient for 1 and 1/2 years. Dr. Dangleis and staff are professional and empathetic toward patients. They are also very punctual returning calls.

Pretty rough road the first 6 months but we have gotten to the point where my  pain is manageable, Thank God.
I am liking life again because of them!|PA Matthew Dangleis and all the staff there are kind and understanding, knowledgeable and professional. Matthew answers all my questions and has been available for tel-med visits. Because of him, I now have a Boston Scientific neuro transmitter in my back and it has helped to control my lower body pain level to where I can walk and do more activities. I am grateful for Mt Baker and Matthew. I only wish there could be a patient portal to make communication easier.|I have been a patient of Mt. Baker Pain Clinic, Arlington, for over 5 years now. I love the front desk staff (Hi Kelly! You're the BESTEST!), medical assistants, and my provider. Through all my twists and turns in life, the pain clinic has always been there to support me during cancer (pain and recovery medication tweaking and management) and through many surgery pain management postoperatively above and beyond what surgeons provide for my complex pain struggles.

The pain clinic never treats me like a number on a clipboard or a pain med seeking junkie which is very valuable to me. I've had pain clinics for over 20 years and not all-- heck not many-- are created so humanely and patient centered. They listen and care and offer a variety of treatments to compliment more than just ""taking pain meds and that's all.""  I value that a lot. Neck injections of all kinds, trigger point injections and similar are very effective for me short term so I seek those as complimentary to the nerve med and pain med I take.

Overall appreciate being treated dynamically and compassionately and value my relationship with everyone at Mt. Baker Pain Clinic!!|The first interview was short and informative.
I despair of having to fill out everything on the Tablet
basically because I'm and old dinasaur when It comes to computers and electronics.
I did survive, talked to the doctor and I felt that he understood
my personal frustrations with oxcycodone 5mg doses.
They were almost useless relieving my leg and hip pains.
The second appointment we talked about my new prescription
for hydrocodone 10mg 3 doses per day, 8 hours apart. for
4 weeks until the end of this month. I'm taking them as directed
and they successfully relieve my pain. I'm actually able now to
stand and cook dinner, walk better, and to stand and work on my
paintings and sculptures. I'm an exhibiting sculptor and painter
with regular shows of my art works.
I truly thank you.|Appointments are on time, no long stays in the waiting room, ever.

Ramona was great on the phone. I put off going to pain clinic for a long time. my first visit ..... I was prescribed ..by Dr. Gilmer. a pain medicine amount that treats pain  for  8 hours. on the planet I live there are 24 hours. that would leave me in severe pain for 16 hours a day.  why stop taking what I take now  that works somewhat 24 hours???unbelievable. my pharmacist    couldn't believe it either. Gilmer had seen my X-rays..and ordered more... but that's what he did .. and told me to come back.... in a month. all heart, that guy. in a month I'm supposed to maybe get a pain block. in a shoulder that's been bone to bone ten years. I get home and read these pain blocks are best used on new sites of chronic pain.. and probably an elderly woman with widespread advanced arthritis.. would not benefit.. much though I might be subjected to multiple attempts so.all to fail so .. I think.. finally  I will agree to take opioids. I have long resisted. though  nearly every opiate pain med is derived from morphine,to which I'm seriously allergic and or combined with the highly toxic and useless  acetomeniphen. the only one that isn't is tramadol. I'm going to see if my primary doc.. will prescribe tramadol along with my usual Diclofenac. something Dr. gilmer could have done.. but didn't. though he's supposed to be the expert I should trust.. perhaps he is unaware of the latest research. I don't know I don't think  northwest spine is committed to elderly people with severe widespread pain people who have difficulty just getting to appts.

I don't know how many visits it would take to get pain relief  superior to what I get now. I am..... heartbroken. I'm trying to stay alive. I'm trying to stay out of a nursing home. I believe if a young person with an athletic injury.. I would have been better treated.. or even middle aged. I could have got my golfing arm fixed. I just want to do the most basic human functions  without horrible pain.i would like that. I don't think they can offer that. it makes me believe ..... they have not had many patients like me.  or if they did... they sent them to nursing homes.. where 60 per cent of the patients with chronic pain.. receive  .. no pain medicine at all.. and most nursing home patients are dead within 5 months, I want to live. but I think.... our  society, including some doctors   would rather .. I just shut up.and give up... like most old people do.|They set up an appointment.

I waited for over a year to get this referral from my on base provider and unfortunately was finally able to be seen close to my move date. I explained this to the team that I wouldn't be able to get the treatment. However, they moved mountains for me so that I was able to at-least get one cervical epidural prior to my separation. The team was incredibly helpful and supportive. They have no idea just how thankful and appreciative I am for them. I've been living and working with this pain for years and was incredibly disappointed when I initially thought that treatment would not be an option for me due to something as simple as time.

Thank you all for your dedication and excellence!|I have seen 4 specialists in WA and 1 in AZ regarding my back issues. Not one would help because of my age and the need for total spine replacement. I was at the end of the line when I consulted with Dr. Hong many years ago. I found he listens, is caring and compassionate. Upon further research I found he is extremely  knowledgable and skillful along with a great personality. I know I will never be pain free again and I know my condition will only worsen. Dr Hong is working closely with me to keep my pain as minimal as possible. I am ever so thankful. I highly recommend Dr. Hong.
I have  follow up procedures in the Puyallup office. The staff is fantastic! They are knowledgeable, efficient and professional. I have always received exceptional service and have witnessed empathy towards other patients.|Sound pain mgmt in lakewood and puyallup no no no dont go. If I could give them a negative number I would!!! Horrible don't go to any location. Especially Mcewan he thinks he is above people and is clearly only there to take your money and not treat you. Arrogant and obviously not intelligent enough to make decisions when it comes to your loved ones pain. Don't waste your time. Probably why you can never reach them on the phone.|If there is someone you really dont like and they need help with chronic pain...send them to this place and watch them suffer for weeks in bed like I am currently.
Please look for better people who care and take time to help improve the quality of life you want and treat your chronic pain.
As WCPM can't seem to manage anything but adding to the pain with complete incompetence. Prior authorization, appeals and phone calls are confusing to the staff who are lacking basic compassion for the patient who is suffering with CHRONIC PAIN.
No communication with the patient definitely no compassion they act more like a bully.
I have been dealing with chronic pain for a few years and a few different states. These people at WCPM are the worst.
As I presently try to complete the circle of idoacracy, with the front office bullies my insurance companies gatekeepers attempting to communicate with the back office Medical Assistant who acts more like a stop sign. They filed 1 PA on Nov 30th it was denied. Instead of filing the appeal like insurance instructed, they submitted another PA the same way. It to was denied. I was told good ol Jordyn is on it and will let you know. Yet I get no phone calls at all EVER.  My phone has 0 inbound calls from WCPM. I have to call insurance daily and see they did nothing but start another PA, then call them with that information. Over and over and over now for 18 days today I was told they finallydid an appealbut that will take 7-10 more days. Somehow they dont seem to understand that waiting for 3 or 4 or more weeks in CHRONIC PAIN destroys your quality of life. Sitting with 6 pedicle screws in my spine and a hip that is frozen locked up and burning like hot pumice stones rubbing against my bones. Unable to sit or lay in any position for longer than 15 min and how bad that affects my family as well. WCPM they dont seem to acknowledge the pain
But they just keep doing the same thing. Refuse to write a different script when my insurance gave a long list just not this specific special drug Dr. HUNG wants me to use even with this discount its $150 for 3 weeks. I am on ssdi becauseof this accident. I have begged I have cried. I have followed their suggestions and went to ER while sat in wheel chair for 4hours just to be sent home with a OTC muscle patch and an Ibuprofen shot after being treated like a junkie and ignored more.
I established care with Dr. Hung on Nov 17 today is Dec 13th and I have received absolutely no care. I have had to make more than 15 phone calls to their office and more to my insurance company. I have had to advocate more for myself with this place than any other office and I have lived in 3 states since my accident.
This office will tell you they care....they dont.
This office will say they will follow up and call you back to let you know what is taking place....they wont.
This office will say they know what needs to be done to help you and they want to help you feel better...they dont
This office will tell you many things....none of them are accurate.  Not one person I have met in this process from beginning with the medical assistant with a total negative atmosphere surrounding her she seemed to hate her job, who called me to the back, to all the receptionist whom I have had to explain this process to seems to care what you are going through. Like missing out on family Thanksgiving to my Pops funeral tonight the boys Christmas choir play is happening but I am in bed in pain and crying. It is looking like I spend Christmas in bed with tears as well.

To sum it up....send your enemies here and your loved ones elsewhere.|Do not go to this place. They are impossible to get a hold of if you have a billing issue. Then they send you a late fee due to their own lack of communication. I reported this to my insurance, WA DOH, CFPB, and the OIG for billing fraud. I am also spending my free time determining any other agency I can report this place to and will do so. I hope this costs them more than they hope to take from me in the long run.|I have been going to this clinic for 3 years usually seeing Dr Hong. I cannot say enough good things about Dr Hong!! He is very friendly and listens carefully to me at each appointment. He is also so caring and compassionate with me and my chronic pain issues!! And he is very knowledgeable about chronic pain issues and medications and treatment options for chronic pain conditions. The staff are usually very supportive and helpful also.|So I really liked this clinic when i first started going. Over the past few months they have really gotten worse at their services. I recently had a doctor cancel my appointment so he could take a longer Christmas vacation and rescheduled me for late in January.

This would have been fine if they were willing to refill my prescription. I am on the lowest dose of  hydrocodone possible following multiple surgeries from a work place injury that has left me disabled. However, you have to visit the doctor to get your monthly refills. They are refusing to do a refill because it has been 3 days over their 2 month limit you have to see the doctor for refills. Even though they cancelled my appointment and the next opening was so far out.

Avoid this place. They show no compassion or care toward their patients.|Absolutely useless. I went here because I moved here from the south very recently and needed a doctor to take over my existing pain management medications and treatments. The doctor refused to do anything at all and said that I have to go see a cervical spine specialist. He also refused to give me a referral for one and my GP told me that he wouldn't either, that the pain clinic had to. That's an endless loop that never treats me at all.

Furthermore I was chewed out and told that I was in the wrong because I asked them to take over treatments and medications they didn't diagnose of prescribe and that I had to start over from the beginning, trying all the meds and treatments that didn't work (and my records were transferred so this was already known), but that they wouldn't do that for me. They never explained why even though I asked.

I was not treated. I was not helped. Worst off I was told that when my medications ran out that I should go to a methadone clinic for the pain medication and ""just deal with it"" for the muscle problem, tumor problems, replacement body part pain, and cervical disk damage.

That's utterly unacceptable and completely inhumane. I would never recommend this place for any reason. I don't see how they're still in business.

It's fine if you don't want to continue pain medications, but you have to help me reduce my dosage on them and you have to treat my problems somehow or the patient will be miserable.

Never waste your time or money here. They don't care about you or your health.",2025-02-19|2024-04-18|2024-11-25|2023-12-13|2024-04-17|2023-09-26|2019-01-03|2020-02-22,5|5|1|1|1|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,wheelchair_accessible_facility|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJN7z3bhD8kFQRonBiGUlmTDw,51

-Dr. mambalam
refused to write him a pain prescription after his nerve ablation (which caused more problems than it helped)  Was gonna refuse to write him a rx today until I showed him I was recording his voice during the visit.
Then he quickly changed and said ""per law"" I have to write you for 30 days.
So per law he has to write it but he allowed the patient to be without pain meds for a week after a nerve ablation.

Then she scheduled me for an appointment in February BEFORE telling me oh btw it's in Bellevue. I wasted a month of being in pain because of the incompetence and now have to get back in with my primary for a referral elsewhere.

Only complaint I have is that it can be very difficult to get to a live person on the phone when calling the clinics at either location. That needs work.|Such horrible doctors at my step dad appointment then wanted to argue with my step dad and mom instead of listening and understanding what's my step dad is going through|The Dr at this facility has forced my husband to do experimental injections that our insurance refused to pay for. But the doctor threatened to take away his pain maintenance if he didn't do them. When he refused to do the last one and most expensive that our insurance wouldn't pay for, he did take away his pain meds for pain maintenance. The injections didn't even work!!!|Dr. Hong is an excellent doctor who cares about his patients. I came to him with pain in my shoulders and knee. Previous doctors had recommended surgery I didn't want and couldn't afford.  Dr. Hong gave me a PRP and stem cell injection in each joint. I was surprised at how quick the procedure took. I have not had any pain in over three years. His staff was very professional and friendly.They followed up with me to make sure I did not have any complications. I highly recommend Dr. Hong and The Washington Center for Pain Management.|We called to setup an out of pocket plan because my husband needs someone who is a good pain management clinician. We were told the initial consult is $200 out of pocket and the first appointment would be within two weeks. So we agreed and had my husband's PCP send a referral.

A few weeks later we finally get the call about whether or not their doctor will see him. He stated he would need to take a ""3 month vacation"" from the medications he's been on for years, that help him to function in life. Most of the time he can hardly get off the couch due to pain, and the only thing that helps is being on narcotic medication along with some non narcotic medications.

Then they said the initial consult is $300 - completely different from what we were told when we first called.

M.Smith.|Dr. Jay Iyengar and staff are absolutely incredible. I was told by two orthopedic surgeons that I needed surgery to remove a good amount of my meniscus in my right knee.  I decided to hold off and try an injection with Dr Iyengar first. I entered the office on crutches with severe pain in my right knee. After one injection, not only did I not need the crutches after a few days, but was able to return to my racquet sports a few weeks later. It's been over a year and I have not had any knee pain and never had to have surgery whatsoever. Dr.Iyengar alleviated my pain which has allowed me to continue to do the activities and sports that I love so much. The office staff is very efficient with the insurance/billing side too. The procedure rooms are immaculate and sterile and his equipment is top of the line, allowing Dr. Iyengar to skillfully place his injections in a very precise manner.

They are tenacious to find the best way to help relieve pain.
I didn't think there would be any relief from my incredible occipital headaches and neck pain from occipital nerve damage.  Using an NALU occipital nerve stimulator, and pain pills, I finally received relief from my pain.
Thank you Doctor Harstroem and all with Anesis.|Absolutely no bedside manor. My mom wasn't able to get a word in as the Dr was just talking w out letting her explain what was going on. Straight away the Dr  said she needed injections. Then the Dr said she can't help my mom. Unexceptable. The Dr 2as in the room for 3 mins and didn't listen to anything. Absolutely horrible. My mom eneded up crying after the appointment|I have some issues with my joints.  Some are worse than others.  Among the superlative worse of them is my left shoulder.   I went to the clinic for an injection.   I honestly wouldn't have minded if the injection was uncomfortable.   I was in so much discomfort, I just wanted the anti inflammatory and the little bit of numbing in the injection.

I felt so much relief!   The doctor has a very gentle touch and an excellent bed side manner.

When a patient is hurting, it's easy to want to take it out on everyone.  What I recognize, and appreciate, is that these folks looked at my chart and could see why I was hurting.  I have had other doctors not show me as much empathy, and sympathy.  When you are really hurting, even if the doctor can't help, it's comforting to have a doctor that doesn't dispute patient discomfort.

They are all empathetic, soft-spoken and patient with folks.  If you're hurting badly,  maybe give these folks a try.  At the very bear minimum, you will be taken seriously.|Anesis Spine and Pain Care, what is it that you exactly do? I put my 1 star review below with an explanation. There are other one star reviews with explanations that make my eyes go wide. Then you have your 5 star reviews to counter balance your 1 stars. Who wrote those? Heck! One woman below gave you a 5 star review because she was amazed at the process of having a COVID 19 test!  My my.... Don't you have your game on! 
I'm inquisitive...because your Renton clinic seems to do nothing really. Where is the staff? I mean, you have such a large space with many rooms. Don't you do injections, ablations, or x-rays even? I saw no one in two visits, except one receptionist, one escort to the doctor's interview room, and the doctor herself. And the bathroom was so clean it was like no one even used it.
What are your crew of MDs up to? And where is the rest of the staff...like a nurse or two? Seemingly, there is no real pain care or public service that I can detect. But, maybe it's just me. I've always come in the afternoon. That must be the reason. I could make a list of reasons to lease or rent such large square footage without doing any real work. Is that what you are doing along with gaslighting pain patients?
There are professionals and then there are people like you...|I was diagnosed with chronic pain many years ago. Dr. Harstroem had been treating me for just over a year and she has changed my life. I even followed her from her Everett practice to Renton because she listens to my concerns and advises multiple ways of treating the pain. My pain level has decreased drastically! My quality of life has improved and I am able to get back to the things I love to do.  Thank you, Dr. Harstroem, don't know what I'd do without you!!|Life changing experience! I have been dealing with neck/back pain for over ten years now and getting spinal injections for about 4 years that typically put me down for a couple of days because they are so painful.
After seeing Dr Harstroem, she suggested that I try something called trigger point injections and OMG... let me tell you! Most of my back pain gets instantly taken away with these! All of the tension in my neck and shoulders relaxes immediately! I no longer have to get the painful injections I was getting before, that half of the time barely even worked!

Dr Harstroem has changed my life and made my day to day living so much better and improved! I can finally go back to doing regular activities!!!|My cousin recently came to America - English is not her first language. Her doctor referred her to Anesis Spine & Pain clinic in the fall. Since day one (October 2023) this clinic has been nothing but an absolute nightmare. When the first appointment was initially scheduled, I asked for an interpreter to be there for my cousin, since I wasn't able to be there. They called a few days before the appointment to reschedule for November, because they couldn't find one. Understandable, I'll let it slide it.. things happen. November rolls around, they call again to reschedule, same issue. Now I'm on more of an alert.. because the future patient is also in pain.. and this is a tad ridiculous. We reschedule for December - I specifically ask again please make sure there is an interpreter because I'm not sure I'll be able to be there - I will try, however just in case to be safe. 3 days before the appointment we confirm the appt. I call ahead on Monday, again - to be safe whether or not an interpreter will be provided - it's crickets. Finally a response - ""We'll call you back"". Okay. Great. All of Monday.. no call back. Tuesday.. half the day.. no call back. I call AGAIN.. they say ""yes we will give the Renton office notice & give you a call back"". Did they call back? No. They didn't. Wednesday rolls around, the day before the appointment - I call around 4pm to AGAIN confirm. They say they don't know. I ask if the patient can have me translate over the phone; or google translator. ""Yes no problem"". Awesome, sounds like we're getting somewhere! Then the appointment happens today - no interpreter, I'm not allowed to translate over the phone (even though I'm certified) AND google translate also isn't allowed! So now I'm starting to believe this office is really discriminating against patients who do not speak English. If your clinic cannot provide an interpreter; then tell the patient ""we're sorry, we cannot accommodate your needs"" and let them know AHEAD of time. Rereading your clinics reviews, I'm starting to believe your clinic needs some major restaffing. I will be filing a discrimination complaint against your office.|Dr. Harstroem is great. She listened to me, ""heard"" what I was saying and we discussed a plan to move forward that I feel good about. Thanks Dr. Harstroem!

Change in itself can be hard. Changing pain management doctors can be hard, stressful and even scary.

The nurses were always very nice and helpful. I had Dr. Fleming and he was great, then he left. After he left, I never saw the front two receptionists again for some reason. From that point on I was seen by Nurse Erin. She was straight forward with my treatment but was constantly telling me how lucky I was to be on the medication I am on, because if I was on opiates she would only prescribe enough opiates to be able to go just shopping, or just to mow the lawn and no more. Just about every time I saw her she just couldn't help but tell me how lucky I am. My last visit I did the usual $200 urine test and got my prescriptions, or so I thought.

They insist if you have a medication issue you have your pharmacy send the request. Okay well I did that the last time they forgot to send my medication over and they never responded to my pharmacy. So I called Alliance and Dr. Fleming took care of it. There is an issue every other time I go there but this final time I have my pharmacy send over the request, it's ignored. I call, no answer. Next day, I call no answer. I'm out of meds by this point, but I wait and call the next day, leave a message directly with Erin and still no call back, no response. I gave up and went to see a different doctor at a different practice who saw me very quickly. I never ended up receiving a call back and basically paid for the privilege of not getting treatment. Weeks later I go to my appointment because I was supposed to have gotten a referral which I also never got, they said they sent that through at my appointment.

I did every thing they asked for, injections, therapy, you name it, but Erin always had me on edge because the first time I saw her she said she wanted to cancel my medication I had been on for months before that for no reason other than by her own words ""I only looked at your file 15 minutes ago so I don't know anything about you."" As if that was my fault, I had my appointment with her made a month before that. Along with the always telling me how lucky I am.

I would recommend you probably go elsewhere unless you okay with withdrawals every other month for no reason other than a lack of compassion and forgetfulness.

I never saw Dr. Ross Vogelgesang so I can't speak as to his care, I'm sure it's just fine.|If you are in pain and you want to be more than a number...this is your place.   I have been a patient on and off for years.  I've had the pleasure of being seen by Erin Henderson as well as Dr. Vogelgesang.  At my worst, I could only walk 20 ft before having to lay down due to pain, unable to sleep, and unable to get a carton of milk from the fridge.     Using muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatory medications, and injections they get me ""back to normal"" in no time.   I'm thankful that small caring places like this still exist.|Dr V. And Theresa, Amazing ! They're so patient with me & willing to walk me through each step of my injections. Theresa is kind enough to hold my hand during the scary process. I've been a patient there for 4 years now. I couldn't ask for better than they are. Dr V takes the time to get to know his patients and he truly cares. Thank-you, to my Care-Team and the Ladies at the front desk, Teddy and Tanner, y'all are the best ! Be Blessed, Dalena Spears|Worst place I've been too. Ran all the way in 1 hrs.

Frank and Patty Cisneros|With all sincerity, Dr. Vogelsang is one of the most intelligent doctors I have had the privilege of being under a doctors care.

He is very well versed in almost all areas and really listens and has a keen sense of understanding people.

He provides a comfortable environment and really has done wonders for me.

I came to him in very bad shape and had three years of dealing with doctors who did not fully understand my issues or me.

The one blessing he gave me is at our first visit he told me to promise him I would never allow myself to be treated with such disrespect from any other medical professional. What an incredible man and such powerful words. He earned my trust and I will forever cherish his words. My point... He cares, listens and has empathy.

His staff is incredible, competent and top notch. He chooses great people, because he is great!

If you are in legitimate pain, I highly recommend the Alliance Pain Center. You will not be disappointed. 

Jennine West|Unfortuanetly after waiting nearly an hour (50 minutes) and not seeing the doctor I left. I was missing work and had to get back. Shortly after leaving I got a call from the nurse telling me that the doctor was about to see me. I explained that I had to get back to work. After some back and forth she told me I shouldn't have accepted the appointment if I couldnt stay. When I told her that she shouldnt have offered it to me if she was so backed up as she claimed was the reason for the hour long wait. She then said I was no longer allowed to come back. I was shocked. I called back and left a voicemail and sent a facebook message regarding this. The doctor and other staff were so friendly that I cant imagine this is normal behavior but no one has called me back. Apparently this is how they feel.|I was a patient there in compliance with everything and then all the sudden with no warning I was dropped. I was told in around about way that the doctors new girlfriend took over the clinic she was rude and unprofessional. I heard her talking to another doctor in the office where they had left the door open saying she was going to Slash all these patients of another doctor that left the practice.

Mara was extremely professional, knowledge, patient & treated me with kindness & respect. She showed me my test imaging results which truly clarified what's been going on  with my spine & why I'm currently having high levels of pain. Prior to my exiting the Spokane Valley Office, Mara fitted me properly for a Spine / Neck  Collar Brace, instructed me on how to use in the proper way & had me show her that I'd learned to use properly use the brace prior to my leaving& taking the brace home with with me.

It seems like, more and more, it is a lost art. So when I experience stellar service, I feel inclined to share about it.
Let me explain:  My body has been a train wreck for years. I have had 4 back surgeries, a spinal cord injury, a hip replacement and arthritis in my back and joints. I have gone for weeks, months, years (my first injury was at age 22), in, pretty much, constant pain. I cannot thank Dr. Dibble and Dr. Mitchell at the Spokane Valley office of the Spine Team enough. Get this:  Two weekends ago, I spent more than 27 hours over 3 days on my feet on concrete ... PAIN FREE. No one was more surprised than I to have that experience.

He listened attentively to my concerns and made me feel valued as a patient, which is something I really appreciate. It's rare to find a doctor who combines expertise with genuine compassion.

After my procedure, I felt confident in my decision to trust him with my care, and I will absolutely return to Dr. Velling if I need ANY further procedures done for my back. I completely trust him and have no doubts about the quality of care I will receive.

In summary, I had an outstanding experience, and I can't recommend Dr. Velling enough! I give him 10 stars for his professionalism, knowledge, and the genuine care he provides to his patients. If you're seeking a doctor who truly has your best interests at heart. Very impressed to say the least.

I'm military so I have been around the world, and you just can't find a doctor this good anywhere!!|IT is great to finally speak to a interventionalist who listens and is clear about the expectations regarding insurance coverage and when we can do the procedure i would like. Prior MD's were like we will do it and process your insurance but if they do not cover you will have to pay the difference. It would be nice to know this information up front. It was also great to have a MD who listens regarding the fact that i have had several interventional procedures so i already know which ones work or do not work for me and the fact that he listened and was like then lets not repeat those that dont work, and move forward.|Personable,

He was empathetic and walked me through every step of the procedure both preemptively and live while it was underway. He genuinely seemed to care about my well being and prognosis. You don't find many doctors these days with this level of emotional intelligence and competence and I'm very grateful.|Dr Nelson was very thorough and explained the procedure in detail. I was in and out quickly. Getting the appointment scheduled with all the back and forth with the scheduler took over a month which was very frustrating and almost caused me to leave the practice for another doctor. The front office is very short staffed...|Like another reviewer here, this review is not at all about Dr. Nelson's medical practice or bedside manner, but the office itself.
I visited Dr. Nelson in early September for imaging--it is late November, and I have still not received results or a follow-up. Despite over half a dozen phone calls to the office, giving times of availability and leaving urgent messages, I have still not received my results. Not via telephone, not via MyChart (which should be incredibly easy)...nothing.
I get the same message each time I call the office, assuring that I will hear back from someone...no dice. Dr. Nelson struck me as a kind, honest, and empathetic problem solver, but this failure to follow-up and communicate with important results and next steps has left me in a standstill with chronic pain that only continues to get worse.|Dr. Nelson and SarahGobble are the best there is. Super caring and know what they are doing.

Dr Nelson saved my life fifteen years ago by making my diagnoses! 10 stars!|Dr Daniel Nelson is caring and compassionate with his patiences. Not only has it been my experience but my wife has seen Dr Nelson on several occasions and we have both had the best of care!|I saw Dr Nelson recently for autogalous stem cell injections for my knees. In this procedure, marrow is aspirated from the posterior hip area, spun down in an FDA approved centrifuge and injected under X-ray guidance into the joint. The pain was minimal throughout the procedure and at all times Dr Nelson was monitoring my responses and medicating if needed. (I actually needed very little, other than local anesthetic for the injections and aspiration.)
Also included was an injection into the joints of PRP--platelet rich plasma. A second PRP injection is performed in 4-6 weeks.
Just 8 weeks before this procedure, my wife was seen for a similar procedure for her shoulder. She had a severe rotator cuff tear that required surgery. Her surgeon is one of the best in the area--shout out here to Dr Michael Codsi--but we wanted to increase the odds of a complete recovery, so, enter Dr Nelson. He gave her the same care I received.
In short, Dr. Dan Nelson and his staff are top-of-the-line care for regenerative medicine in the Puget Sound.|Over the years Dr. Nelson has proven to be a highly skilled and uniquely caring physician in the area of pain management and treatment. He demonstrates an  unusual mix of professionalism, and commitment to make you feel comfortable by explaining step by step what the procedure involves. Among Dr. Nelson's qualities are his excellent bedside manners and his eagerness to answer the toughest of questions. I rank him among the very best in all medical specialties combined.|*Edit: it is 09/10/2024 and I was finally called and told that no provider can see him so they referred me to call another clinic. Again. Why not tell me in July when we first called your office that we might not be able to be seen.

No you had my husband wait about a month and a half to be told to go somewhere else.

If I could give negative stars I would.

My husband was involved in an accident back in may. He was a bicyclist. He was referred to this location by one of the providers he's working with.

We put in a request at the end of July. I don't hear back from them for two weeks. I had to keep calling and was given different reasons for what was going on. Our pip adjuster confirmed that she had spoke with them and confirmed there was coverage, after weeks more I get a phone call from someone named Olga Jackson who provides me this information
Email: o.jackson@proliancesurgeons.com
Fax 425-821-3550
Our conversation took place on 08/23/24. She advised me to have my husband's pcp send her over a referral in case the pip is not able to cover it. She says once she gets the referral she will send over a message to the pain management team to see who is available to take my husband on as a patient. My husband's pcp sends over the referral on 08/26. I wait two days and call Olga and leave her a message. No response. I call Olga again on 09/03, leave her a message, no response. So today 09/05 I call the main office number where I speak with Giselle, who is very rude and informs me there is no referral and that she doesn't know why old would be involved and she doesn't handle these kinds of things. I explain to Giselle my initial conversation with Giselle, who again informs me I am wrong, Olga has nothing to do with this and told me there is no referral.

We started trying to set up an appointment in July and it is currently September. My husband is in pain and had I known this would have been the outcome I would have gone somewhere else. This office lacks communication and customer service.

Please don't waste your time coming. I'm sure the doctors are really good at what they do but good luck getting in. I'm very disappointed.

She's compassionate, personable, down to earth and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend her.

Before coming here I was grossly over prescribed. While it was scary coming off of certain meds and adjusting doses of others I'm so happy I did; less medication is working better for me. They really know what they're doing! Best, most responsible treatment I've ever received.|***My issue is not that I was asked to stop a medicine that potentially could interact with a new medication. I'm disappointed by the way I was treated, and that I wasn't even allowed to see the doctor and discuss what medicines need to be stopped. This information could have been given to me in the first phone call I made instead of stringing me along for 6 weeks while I was in pain. When I called, they took note of my medicines and asked if I was willing to stop them and I said YES. This was a terrible experience because no one told me initially so I could get things adjusted prior to an appointment. The doctor refused to even see me.***

I was referred to Lake Washington Pain Management by my PCP. They never called me for an appointment, and after a week I called them. Spoke with Rebecca who said she had to send my info, including current meds, to the doctor to approve me as a patient. She instructed me to get 1 month of pain medicine from my PCP because they had appointments in early June.

There was no callback after a week, so I called back. Rebecca was out of office. A receptionist said she would be out until 5/22 and that Rebecca is the one who handles scheduling so she couldn't schedule me. I called back 5/22. Rebecca apologized and said she worked me into the schedule for Friday 5/26 since I only have 8 days of medicine remaining.

She called me back on 5/24 to tell me the doctor would not see me because I'm prescribed 1mg of Clonazepan (1x per day). This is prescribed by my psychiatrist who I see regularly. I had told Rebecca in our first phone call I was willing to discuss changing those meds, but they refused to see me until I have stopped them completely. Not only was this interaction the most unprofessional I have experienced, but it puts me in an awkward situation with my PCP and current medications.|Dr. Naibert,  is the worst.  I met this this guy in 2006 in Edmonds WA. He was more worried about his new house under construction on mercer Island then me. He's rude, obnoxious, and treats you as a patient second class. He's had his problems, but I shouldn't have been the one he takes it out on. I can say nothing positive about him. Stay away. His true colors came out the first day I met him. He'll give you more pain than you knew you had. I was even told to boycott Walgreens in Edmonds because there was an issue with them calling authorities on him. There was actually a post it note hanging in the patient room, that's how I learned of it.|I've been a happy and relatively pain free patient for over five years. Unlike the other negative reviews, I understand pain specialist must stay on top of the demanding and ever evolving regulations. These regulations mean patients must also follow specific rules placed on them by the provider at Lake Washington Pain Management. Some of these rules may not make sense to those who refuse to adapt as required to ensure their pain management plan doesn't put their lives in danger. One drug screen showed nicotine. They were quick to question me on this fearing I had begun using tobacco products. Nicotine can negatively interact with some medications.

Prior to being accepted as a patient at Lake Washington Pain Management I was being grossly over prescribed. In addition I was prescribed a deadly combination of medication. Being accepted to the Lake Washington Pain Management may have very well saved my life. In addition to weaning me off prescriptions with deadly interactions Doctor Naibert began immediately reducing the grossly over prescribed medication. It took nearly two years, but we were able to comfortably and painlessly reduce my med by 80% (***every patient, their prescriptions, and their situation is different. Do not use my experience as a template for your individual treatment plan***).

We've been so successful reducing my meds and tweaking meds/therapies, I was able to reduced meds a further 33% on my own last year. It is true, less is indeed more. Prior to Dr Naibert accepting me as a patient I would wake with horrible headaches each and every day. My previous doctor simply kept increasing the doses while adding in and trying new medications. That provider nearly killed me. There were serious signs I was overdosed. However I didn't know what or how to recognize signs of overdose. Besides I was being treated by a pain specialist....right? Wrong. I would pass out and sleep for hours any time of the day. I gained over 45 pounds eating anything with sugar and drank 12 cups of coffee a day. To be fair I have complex injuries and conditions. However that is no excuse for over dosing me and prescribing me a deadly cocktail. After switching doctors I asked the pharmacist about the deadly cocktail; she admitted she had concerns and phone the doctor multiple times over the years but was told she had no need for concern. She now knows to report deadly prescription interactions when a provider shows indifference and she feels the patient in danger. Sadly not all pharmacist have the courage to confront doctors and report potentially deadly prescriptions.

As others have noted Dr. Naibert can be intense. To some his personality and opinions may be too much..... however he is now retired. Although retired he has filled in a time or two.

This clinic serves the diverse public. As such patients are also diverse. Which clearly indicates this clinic does not discriminate, seek high net worth cash only patients, or operate as a pill mill. And yes, like all other pain clinics there are addicts who show up with a valid referral seeking treatment. All I can say on that is I've never seen those who appear sketchy twice. They likely were refused opioids. This clinic is not dirty, nor a pill mill for street addicts. The gentleman who posted the false review was likely not accepted as a patient, was refused an opioid prescription, or was told he would no longer be treated because he failed a drug test.

I trust Lake Washington Pain Management with my life. I honestly believe they saved my life.

Give them a call if you want a provider who cares and will work with you to find the correct pain management plan tailored to your specific needs.|I called over two weeks ago seeking treatment for chronic pain.  I was advised that I needed a referral and 3 months of chart notes which I had sent in that day.  Some one called me last week to screen me.  One of the questions was if I used marijuana.  I advised them that I used CBD oil to control inflammation and nausea.  She  asked if I would quit if I were prescribed an opioid.  I said I would doubt it but I would be willing to discuss it with a provider because I have never gotten adequate pain relief from  any opioid  I have ever had before, they make my skin itchy, I use CBD oil everyday and I don't even know what options are available.

I called today because I had not heard back from them yet.  They advised me that they would not be able to even have a consultation with me to discuss treatment options unless I was willing to commit to give up the CBD 100% and the doctor would have no discussion with me.

I find this disturbing, especially during an opioid epidemic.  Treatment alternatives were not even presented to me and I was turned away because I have been responsible with my medicinal care.  This strikes me as irresponsible and unprofessional medicine, but I am not an expert.|My mom was referred here when she was  in her late 80s.   She had been an RN many years ago so she knew something about the medical world.   She had horrible problems with pain from arthritis and long-term problems and she needed narcotics to manage her pain.

Ultimately mom's primary care doctors felt that they could not prescribe the levels of narcotic medicine that she needed, so they referred her to LWPM.

My mom was not an addict.   I mean she really wasn't.   But she was always treated as an addict when she came here.   The front desk staff was cold, although they did what they had to do.   There was no sense of compassion from the front desk.   I assumed they were used to a lot of addicts trying to work the system.

I will say that this clinic controlled Mom's pain and adjusted her dosage as needed.

Mary, the ARNP in the office, was wonderful.   My mom always hoped she would get Mary.   Dr. Neibert was a bit different.    He always wrote the RX she needed, but he was more combative.

The thing that bothered me most about Dr. Naibert was on one visit he told us that he was a Trump supporter, and he believed that the social safety net should be disbanded and that we should go back to a world where churches provide the safety net.

He is entitled to his opinion, but we did not share it, and we felt it was totally inappropriate for a clinical setting.

I mean what do you do or say?   You need the RX for your pain, so you sit there and nod.   I mean FFS.   And he was very often gone on safari to Africa or wherever, to kill animals.

There was this really creepy feeling about going there.   My mom felt it.   It was like the front desk staff thought everyone was scamming, and the doctor did not seem very compassionate.    The whole office felt like they had had way too much experience getting punked by addicts.

My mom fell and died after a couple weeks.   This had nothing to do with this clinic.   She was just unstable on her feet.

And when she was admitted to the hospital, I told them what her RX was, and they were kind of horrified, but I did not feel mom was over-treated.   Her doctors at Overlake were kind of horrified, but they were not pain management specialists.    I got so angry at them when mom was dying.   She was clearly in pain and they were prescribing a fraction of what she had been on before.   I kept telling the doctors that they were under prescribing and she was moaning in pain.

It was not until the hospital put Mom on ""hospice care,"" and Evergreen Hospice came in that I felt she was getting the treatment she needed.   When I explained her history to the nurse, he immediately upped her doses so she would not die in pain.

So I give them 3 stars.   I hated the front desk.   Dr. Naibert made me feel uncomfortable.   Mary was so kind.|I've been a patient of Dr. Naibert's for about 3 years now and he's contributed greatly to saving my life. I suffered severe back damage from a serious car accident on I5 when I was 6 months pregnant 13 years ago (was airlifted to Harborview as my car was flipped on the freeway). I was referred to Dr. Matthews in Bellevue and for the next 10 years I was under his ""care""....I trusted him. Then I got a call from the state. His license was being revoked for constant overprescribing and abusing his oath. I was terrified, where would I go? Who was going to gain 10 years of knowledge of my injuries and my case? Would I have to start all over again with building trust? I found Dr. Naibert and from day 1 I've been in great hands. My very 1st appt i found out I was being OBSCENELY overprescribed (I was on 4 80mg Oxycontin and 24 30mg Oxycodone A DAY) on my own I weaned myself off all Oxycontin and with Dr. Naibert's careful guidance I've tapered WAAAAAY down off the Oxycodone and will be completely opioid free one day very soon. Sooo amazing. These bad reviews you're seeing are from keyboard commandos and internet troll warriors who are probably doctor shoppers and were booted from Naibert's clinic, they also don't have the integrity to share their concerns with Naibert, instead they (like 80% of millennials and snowflakes today) run to their keyboards to spew lies and damage a really good doctors name. Don't come to this clinic if you're just looking for your next fix, you aren't going to get past my no-nonsense,  no b.s., no muss no fuss Doctor.  And I feel safer just knowing that about him. He also has some of the best staff at the front desk, the sweetest gals are there to greet you every time. Very clean and organized waiting area. The walls are adorned with Naibert's amazing photography he himself took. He's proud of his 20 year recovery story and that's one of the biggest reasons I trust him with my life.|Melissa Barclay is a wonderful dr, always listens to what I have to say and has a reasonable treatment plan to accommodate my pain and medical needs!

My only problem is they never call you, so whenever I need to schedule an appointment I have to harass them, normally they wait to hear back from my insurance and then they call me, nope, I do that because if I waited for them it took them 6 months.

This was my first time seeing him and he basically said I need to be off of my pain medication which I've been on for two years at the lowest dose. He took my prescription from 4 times a day down to three times a day. Mind you he's not who I see he's a stand in.  He wasn't trying to hear what I had to say on the matter. He has a rude demeanor. I do not want to see him again.|This is based on the Lacey office and doctor Burkley.  I initially gave them 5 stars I've seen them 3 times the first time I've seen them was to discuss my chronic pain issues and all my back issues.  It was the initial appointment and they were great, second time I got a few pain pills and he would monitor me. No offer of anything else just pills, ok fine i dont like pain meds but will take them when i absolutely need to and i actually had expired ones i had brought with me and turned into him this last visit. I was supposed to come back for a recheck from the 2nd visit however I didn't make it back because I ended up getting pancreatis from a bad gallbladder and was given pain meds due to the pancreatis and had been  very ill from that add in a few deaths in the family and I just did not make it back for another follow up. when I finally was able to come back which was  last month, July of this year he was not friendly, hes not a friendly doctor anyways he has an unfriendly demeanor and that's fine I got along with him regardless, but he really didn't do anything or offer anything. I asked him if he could get me an MRI as felt like my back had gotten worse And we discussed that briefly and then he kinda said okay I will get a hold of you and out he went. it's been a month and I just called to see what was going on and apparently there's nothing more they can do for me or my pain.  But heres the thing, they havnt done anything for me anyways beside give me a few pain pills. I did not ask for pain meds this last appt when I came back  i asked to be reevaluated  as my back feels worse and it had been a long time since anyone had did an mri to see if it had progressed. But they didn't offer me any alternatives, no lumbar injections etc they  just said sorry we cant help u anymore. Well u didnt help me in the 1st place except give me drugs. Thats it no alternatives and doc Burkley you sir are rude and condensing and should not work in a field that should atleast possess some compassion for those of us with chronic pain.
Did u ever think we are often out of it because we are chronically tired from lack of sleep due to pain? No u just assume we are all  drug seekers.
Shame on you Im absolutely disgusted with you and this place and will make sure to share that with many.

I do not recommend them anymore.|I have been being seen at Anesis Pain & Spine Center now for about 3 years. I have to say, I have never been treated unkindly or indifferent. I can count on all of the Physicians at Anesis to take care of me, and I believe they Really Do Care. One time I had an appointment, I was coming from Bellevue to Tacoma I was over 45 mins late.... The Doctor Stayed and waited for me because she knew I was coming from Bellevue, and Traffic  As a matter of fact I have an appointment today for injections . Compassionate Doctors, and Staff I don't know what I would do without you guys I would easily give them. 5  
Thank You Anesis.. T Chambers|The people here are great. The treatments they offer are beyond what other pain clinics offer. They truly want to help you. They listen to your concerns and treat you with respect. I have never felt like I'm ignored ir treated poorly.|In two visits I've had positive experiences with Dr. CHEUNG. The staff was friendly, the waiting area was clean, and the doctor took the time to listen to my concerns, providing thorough explanations and guidance. Overall, it was a professional and caring environment that made my visit comfortable.|I recommend this practice and all the wonderful people that work there whole heartedly. I came into this office in so much pain I was unable to even make my own bed and was having trouble walking. I had a plan to get my life back and they were 100% on board. They listened to me and helped me with my back problems first. I now am pain free in my back for the first time in over a decade. We are going to tackle my hip problem next. I know that they will help me get back to the lifestyle I want. I can't say enough good things about these people and the wide variety of help they have available to get patients better. They truly do care about their patients.|I have degenerative disc disease and Anesis has helped me for the last 3 years navigate different treatment plans to get the best results possible.  I'm happy to say that today was my final visit unless I start experiencing symptoms again. In December I had a spinal stimulator implanted which has reduced my pain by 90%.  I don't have to take pain medication any more and I don't have to think about if a certain movement will cause shooting pain in my back or leg.  I just have to remember to recharge the stimulator every couple days to keep it on.  I highly recommend Anesis if you are looking for a solution for your pain.  I think the biggest barriers comes from what insurance wants to cover, but they helped navigate through all the options and prerequisites needed to get my treatment where it needed to be.  I am forever grateful to return to a normal pain free life.|I can't say enough to praise Dr. Burkey and the staff at Anesis Spine and Pain. I am walking without a cane again after two years of needing one. Dr. Burkey listens and is attentive to my needs and concerns, especially in my desire to stay off of opioid pain meds. The treatment I receive is cutting edge and highly effective. I never have a problem getting an appointment when I need one and am always treated with the upmost respect and courtesy. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Burkey and Anesis Spine and Pain to anyone having to deal with chronic pain. The only exception would be if you just want a doctor to throw pills at you.

He has been a great help in addressing health from an immediate and preventative perspective.|Everyone I have met at this pain clinic, from front desk, through nurse, right up to my doctor, Dr. Jing, have been both kind and professional.  Empathy is so important, and we patients know when it's real.  Thank you Dr. Jing, Rosalee, and all the staff.|Dr, Settle is my favorite doctor by far!! I have been seeing him even before he came to multi care gig harbor!! I have been seeing him for about 16-18 yrs now!! I don't want him to retire but I hope multi care finds a great & understanding Dr like Dr Settle!!|Dr. Lau made such an amazing impression on me. She knew a lot of things many of my doctors didn't - quite a variety of knowledge. She was down to earth, truly listened to me, and she made an intelligent and conservative plan for my care that includes seeing specialists who can help me get to the root of WHY the pain and how to fix the causes of it rather than just treat one of the symptoms. As far as I'm concerned, that is a doctor who's worth her weight in gold.|This was my first visit with Dr Settle  and he was absolutely awesome... He will be continuing my pain management while I also see my regular Dr ( Blaisdell) for all other of my medical needs. I feel I have a good team that will help me sort out my health struggles...|These guys are the best! Especially the supporting staff who will go above and beyond if you're having trouble with your refills or if you end up somewhere they are denying you meds. They make sure your meds are effective and you can return to some form of decent living. I gave up many times for years of having everyone treat me like a drug seeker and finally found these guys. The pain clinics aren't what they say they are and just want to do implants and whatever they want to do without considering you. Pain management treats your pain with medication and that's just what they do|Dr. Settle and his staff stay on top of all patient issues.  They are relentless in their follow-up for their patient needs no matter the circumstances. Thank you Dr. Settle and staff!|Doctor comes in and mentions that she was looking over my file, meaning she probably made up her mind about me before she even met me. She goes through the motions and does the physical and begins to ask me questions, asks if I've seen a nerve doctor and have had a nerve test-yes. Seen a PT-yes. Tried trigger point injections- yes, didnt work. A psychiatrist-yes. Tried massage/acupuncture-yes. Tried a sleep study-yes. Tried aqua therapy- no but we can. Compression socks and gloves-yes. Seen an orthopedic surgeon-yes. Trying to find the root of the pain... Ms, its the years of drugs i put in my body, the diabetes, my three bulging disks in my back and the two in my neck and old age.

She finally says at the end, ""Well, I'm conservative"" when it comes to prescribing pain medications. Okay? And so am I. I waited as long as I could to make this appointment with you, so i wouldn't have to be subjected to this. To be judged. I was hoping to talk to someone empathetic. Someone who would understand that my pain has escalated and is forcing me to be here

I'm struggling to understand how you can be conservative and be in control of peoples pain? In control of someones suffering? You're in the wrong business. I'm also confused on why she was pushing for me to take trasadone but then told me she doesn't want to prescribe a pain medication because they could make me drowsy and make me more of a fall risk. Huh?

I had to have a thumb amputated a year ago and had to battle a pretty severe infection after the surgery. I was in the hospital for weeks. While in the hospital they gave me oxycontin, that was the only thing added to my med regimen, and I felt wonderful. Not high or drowsy or any negative side effect. I was able to sleep, my daughter visited and even said she noticed i was moving a little quicker and easier getting myself to the bathroom, that my mood was more chipper (i wasnt in severe pain). This doctor didnt listen to anything i said. She saw my depression score, saw my past record with drugs in my 20s and wrote me off.

Dr. Fisk and his team are truly exceptional. I was initially hesitant about undergoing Ketamine treatments for my chronic pain and depression, but from the moment I walked into the clinic, I knew I was in good hands.

The staff at Acute Pain Therapies are not only professional and knowledgeable, but also incredibly kind and reassuring. I was worried about feeling anxious during my Ketamine IV infusions, but their calming presence put me at ease. They made sure I was comfortable and well taken care of throughout the entire process.

I have tried numerous treatments for my chronic pain and depression in the past, but nothing has worked as effectively as Ketamine. The results have been truly life-changing. If you are experiencing similar issues, I urge you to not hesitate any longer and seek relief at Acute Pain Therapies.

Overall, my experience at Acute Pain Therapies has been nothing short of exceptional. I am so grateful to Dr. Fisk and his team for their expertise and compassionate care. Do not let any doubts hold you back - take the first step towards relief and book an appointment today. You will not regret it.|Dr. Chloe Kennedy is a phenomenal doctor. She is compassionate and leaves you feeling heard and understood. I'm healing from complications I had during surgery and she's been the first physician to understand my concerns and actually address them as oppose to being swept under the rug. I really respect her and feel grateful for being connected with her. Thank you!|I should start with, I was in a really bad car accident in 1993 and ended up in the hospital for a month. I ended up with half a knee cap, titanium rods in both femurs, pins in my ankle, and hips, limited mobility, and I had to learn to walk again after being bed ridden for several months.  Needless to say, I've been working with pain management doctors for a little over a decade and it's been difficult.

After moving here from another state, and having several bad experiences, I was recommended Acute Pain Therapies from my insurance provider along with a few others and I am so glad I found them. I agree with what others said, they treat you with dignity, care, and respect.

Most importantly, they listen to you, treat you like a human being, not just a number, they take the time to understand your situation, and then offer a comprehensive plan that aligns with what your body needs in order to function as normally as your body allows.

I'm not ready to give up or give in.  So, I look forward to working with them as they continue to help me manage my pain.  .|I used to come here for depression and PTSD treatments. This was of course before they told me to take down my Google Review. If I did not take down my review I was told that I would not be able to reschedule my appointment or future appointments.
The person who told me this called me from the clinic phone. Announced it was acute pain therapies calling and let me know the phones were working and advised me to take down my Google Review or they would not let me schedule or reschedule.
I have no idea if this person has been fired or how long this highly unethical and illegal advice has been going on. It's not just bad advice it's blackmail!
I will never ever come back to this clinic because I am not going to trust a doctor that is highly likely now mad at me with a needle in my neck.|I am always treated with the upmost dignity and respect when I have my appointments at Acute Pain Therapies.
.  The staff at the front desk (Peter)
goes beyond his job requirements to be welcoming, helpful and friendly!!
Dr. Chloe Kennedy is also warm, great at explaining things, and validating the patients explanation of their pain .  She is gentle and kind.  A wonderful addition to the practice!

Of course, Dr. Fiske is excellent at listening and understanding what the patient is expressing.
I have always felt heard and taken seriously about my pain when he has been with me.

I feel trusting and safe there especially since some drastic changes were made in the staff about in the last couple of years.
Thank you for being a safe place for myself and others who are suffering to come for help!|Chloe Kennedy is great! She listens to her patients and treats you like a person and not a number! Dr Julian and Haleen have been incredible as well the few times I have met with them both!|I highly recommend the Acute Pain Therapies office in Bellevue, Washington.  The moment I enter the office, I'm warmly greeted and taken care of.  I know the support staff, physician assistants, and doctors focus on the well being of each patient, because it's evident during each meeting I have with them.

For years I thought that the ever present pain, lack of sleep, and my reduced activity level had become my ""New Normal.""   But since going to this office and working with Chloe K.

Obviously this man is a genius, award winning in his field, and genuinely compassionate.|A sincere thank you Dr Kim.   Gave me significant relief after 4 business days.   Professional and thorough.     Cares and wants to get the most appropriate intervention done as soon as possible.  The Dr obviously has the patient's best outcome at heart.    These type of injection specialists can make more money doing all their injections 1-2 days a week (2 -3 WEEKS AFTER your initial appointment) and farming out a lot if the prep to an under-qualified Nurse Practitioner (No burn on NPs but they are not meant for surgical intervention)   Instead this Dr can sometimes do injections same day and oversees all steps of the procedure.  I've worked in the medical field for 22 years and this provider is the helpful/timely doctor that I needed.  Thank you Dr Kim|I highly recommend Dr Kim.

I was in terrible condition at that point and had to have emergency surgery.

Just listens and types does what he thinks is right. Acts buddy buddy. This review has been years over do.. have disc,nerve,hip etc problems and he focuses on what he thinks. He needs to watch a brilliant mind and take some notes. I have many but I'll tell you the last time I went. Told him my back had gone out a few times last couple months . Rebounding spasms. Etc i told him i was taking a little more then i normally do on tramadol. he never asked me how much I was taking which is one first hour.. I'll talk half of 2nd one hour later and other half if need be.. no more then 2 a day if that. He assumed I'm probably smoking injecting who knows. So I go to get my normal prescription and it's cut to 16 from 54 about pills andddddddd aaaaa box a narcan..
Guess I'm a drug addict so it seems like he thinks.  Never one word he said about this when I went to pick it up.. wants to inject you more then anything|Dr Kim is really ridiculous.  He doesn't seem to care about his patients.  if he can't continue to bill someone's insurance, he gets very annoyed. I ended up having to have surgery and he was annoyed that I had to start seeing the surgeon.  Now today 10.21.2024 I just received a bill for balance due after insurance. Date of service was 1.31.2023. This is the second bill I've received from him for services just about 2 years old.
What a joke!!!!!
He gets mad when he can't continue to bill insurance.  Beware patients and insurance companies.
Tisk, tisk, tisk Dr. Kim.  Very bad juju|Dr. Kim treated my son's herniated disc with steroid injections on two separate occasions nearly two years apart. He was very empathetic towards my son which helped him relax and feel heard. I was very aware of how carefully and methodically Dr. Kim considered all medical notes and test results from multiple providers across several years. He also spent a lot of time discussing the best approach. The procedures aren't fun but both my son and I felt very confident in his expertise and approach. (It's also worth noting that Dr. Kim was able to successfully treat my son's pain after he had seen another M.D,  for the same procedure: we believe Dr. Kim's expertise and experience made the difference and allowed my son to avoid surgery. )|Dr. Kim is outstanding. I have chronic back pain and I'm choosing to treat my pain extremely conservatively (and opt against surgery at this time). Dr. Kim was very supportive of my choices, extremely knowledgeable of my condition, very efficient in each visit, empathetic of my pain, and his entire office staff reflects the same. I had an epidural steroid injection by Dr. Kim, which I have had several previously by other professionals to treat my pain. Dr. Kim did an amazing job (the procedure was nearly pain free and Dr. Kim narrated as he performed the different process of the procedure, I'm very familiar with the procedure, so I'm sure if you wanted more of a narrative or less he would be happy to do) and he did not over use lidocaine like in my previous experiences, Dr. Kim used the perfect amount, which I am so impressed with! (In a previous experience I had a doctor give too much which made me unable to walk without assistance for a 24 hour period). After my quick and nearly painless procedure by Dr. Kim I felt very confident to walk again (unassisted). All around excellent experience and I highly recommend if you're looking for a doctor educated, efficient, empathetic, and direct (he is straight to the point - which I really appreciate)! Thanks, Dr. Kim and staff for such a positive experience! Looking forward to seeing you again soon.|Dr Kim is awesome. He's extremely knowledgeable and professional in his practice. I had always feared having the shots in the spine for chronic lower back pain. Dr Kim is skilled, and the spinal shots were no big deal!
Thank you Dr Kim!!|Dr. Kim has always been very compassionate and professional with me. It's obvious that he genuinely cares about my well being. He has helped me though difficult times.  His procedures have helped me function and work with much less pain.  Thank you Dr. Kim for being there for me!|Dr. Kim is thorough, thoughtful, communicates transparently, and has done a great job for me as a patient.|Dr. Kim is by far the best doctor I've seen related to my chronic back pain.  I was able to easily get an appointment that matched my schedule.  He proposed an epidural steroid injection, which I've had in the past.  While my pain continued, Dr. Kim spent two weeks convincing Regence Blue Shield King County that it was an appropriate procedure.  I went in to follow up while he was negotiating with Regence.  He received approval while I was there then and said ""Well, you're here, let's do it now.""  Perfect!  While I've experienced a lot of pain going through my last epidural a year and a half ago with a physician in Kent/Renton, my experience with Dr. Kim was a completely different experience.  While he prepared my back for the injection, I felt a tiny tiny pin prick on my back.  Laying on the table, I was awaiting the injection, steeling myself for extreme pain - like I said, my prior experience was severe pain, as if I'd been electrocuted.  While I'm waiting for the procedure to continue, Dr. Kim announces that he completed the injection.  Never did feel a thing.  And, it seems that Dr. Kim was correct - it was an appropriate procedure as it knocked my pain down by 60% or more.  Dr. Kim is a very interesting physician; easy to converse with and puts one at ease discussing issues that potentially bring up stress.  He's a great man to deal with.  I give him 5 stars and a thumbs up on top of it!!  I would recommend him to anyone with chronic back pain.",2025-01-20|2024-10-21|2024-04-02|2022-09-01|2023-07-14|2022-12-07|2024-11-07|2016-10-09,1|1|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJVVVVVeVvkFQRfr6onGlsY4c,21

I have been suffering from chronic pain for a long time due to a military injury, and I was eventually referred to Dr. Wagner. Working with him was, compared to previous doctors I have had to deal with, extremely pleasant. He was willing to listen to my issues and concerns, and was never pushy about things I had concerns about, and actually remembered the things I told him.

For example, my chronic pain is related to some nerve damage in my torso, for which one possible treatment are injections into the rib muscle. There are many concerns with this, namely lung puncture risk and the fact that you develop a tolerance to the medication each time until it no longer becomes effective. I found this to be a poor solution for long term chronic pain, but previous doctors always seemed to push this treatment on me regardless of my complaints. Dr. Wagner however understood my reservations and agreed with me, and whenever we would try something new, skip past it and comment the reasons we weren't going to try it. It made me feel respected and that he was invested in my care and priorities.

The only reason I stopped seeing him is because the only thing that ended up working were stronger classes of painkillers that had undesirable side effects that I was no longer interested in making the trade-off for, and there wasn't much else to be done. I recommend anyone suffering from chronic pain to consider Dr. Wagner, as you will find in him a compassionate doctor who believes you, focuses on what will work for you, and is happy to try new things that you're comfortable with.|I was on a dinner cruise & hit my head on the railing of the boat.

In 2017, after 4 botched back surgeries in four months,  I was told after the last surgery that after two more years, I would be the best I could get.
For over two years now I have been  pretty much house bound,  unable to do much of anything.  The nerves have attacked my thighs, calves, sciatic area, etc.  Enough said.  My family physician referred me to Dr. Wagner.  It is as if a miracle came about.  After Dr. Wagner gave me the pain  shots he recommended, I have had 2  months of feeling normal.  Not falling, wobbling, hurting ...AMAZING !!  I would recommend Dr. Wagner to anyone in need of pain relief.  He listens to you, is very thorough and easy to talk to.  I would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone in pain.|This is ""The BEST"", Doctor for pain relief that I have EVER been to! I will recommend Dr. Wagner any time to anyone!!!! He will treat you like a person! Not a figure of bones! Keep up the GREAT work doc, we who know you & your work, Love you!! You Are the "" BEST!""
Mrs. Clark|I had badly twisted my neck and with a set of cortisone injections Dr. Wagner was able to resolve 2 months of significant pain.
Great teamwork with staff in the procedure room.
Much appreciated.

My primary referred me to Dr Wagner this last summer as she had tried everything possible to control my chronic pain , 3 neck surgeries and progressively getting worse . Dr Wagner  and I had made the decision to try shots in my neck (have had different ones in the past with no relief ) within a week I was able to do regular life things that people take for granted  , and just kept getting better ... I was not waking up with horrible neck pain , numb fingers , burning in arms . I know this will need to be repeated as medicine leaves the body , but I know I will again feel relief .

She had previously been prescribed a lot of opiate painkillers for over 20yrs, and they were no longer working for her.  Probably causing more harm than help. Dr. Overton was able to assist me with getting mom cut back and eventually off the high amounts of opiates she'd been on for so long.  He placed her on 2mg of a newer prescription drug, that took away her cravings as well as taking care of her pain issues.  She is now 81yrs old, and is in the best health I've seen her in in the past 25yrs.  Thanks for your help and support Dr. Overton and staff!! We miss you and wish you the best always! Bless you!!|I dont think ive ever left a review but i thought i should now As much as miss my old doctor that retired.

But overall im happy i can continue have my pain under control and work save up for surgery
And try enjoy life.|This review is in response to David Byers review of David Overton. I am a CNA and have taken my client to David Overton numerous times as he is her pain specialist. First of all he has her test at most visits for opiate abuse which she has never done. It protects him and the person being tested. Sometimes the system does not connect with the pharmacy, so yes they have to send the script again. There was a time when my client had to use a paper script because the service was down.  He also caught the mistake my clients PCP did that I brought up to him. I was worried because she had prescribed a narcotic for my client to sleep. She was already on a pain narcotic. When I brought it to his attention he immediately took her off of it and put her on a non narcotic non addictive sleep medication. So he is NOT pill pusher! David does not deal with shoppers who go from doctor to doctor shopping for pain meds. If some is looking for a professional pain doctor I would definitely recommend him.|I have had nothing but problems with Mr Overton PA at Advanced Pain Care. He is unorganized, forgets to complete what he has promised to do and is unable to use any form of online system to interact with  a pharmacy. He even admits their system has problems and you need to monitor your prescriptions to see if your pharmacy even gets them. I have had the pharmacy techs tell me they have faxed him up to 7 time for refills and had zero response. I have even had to drive to his office to get paper prescriptions. I also doubt his qualifications as he has over perscribed medications that MDs have said were dangerious doses. I just tried to get a non opioid medication filled and had contacted his office telling them the pharmacy had received no response from him and that I would run out in several days. I had to call his office again only to be told I would need to schedule an appointment in 2 weeks. If this was a requirement I should have been to this at my last appointment. I believe David Overton to be unqualified as a pain management provider, totally unprofessional and dangerous. I won't be returning and you should not go to this clinic.|Everyone at this clinic is very professional and caring.  Took the time to explain everything, listen to my concerns and resolved my chronic pain issue.  I could not be happier!

Had surgery and relief for 5 months then the pain was  is back. Went back to pain management and they have screwed up my med delivery each week by not calling it in no matter how early I contact them. Each week I go days without pain meds. I live in a bed. I can't sit for long nor walk more than ten feet. I have unbearable pain. The pain clinic sent an apology for their lack of care giving after the fact and then did it all again.|I was sent here from a foot surgeon I was seeing. I had no idea he was sending me to a pain clinic. He had told me on 2 separate visits that he would be doing surgery to fix my foot that I had 3 surgeries on it already. But it was still really messed up and the pain from this foot is really bad. Someday it's a 10. I start coming to this clinic and from day 1 they treated me with little to no empathy or bed side manner.  The Dr I see from this clinic is the 8th Dr. I have called and left numerous messages for a return call and you get zero response.  Or if you do, it's days to a week later. I'm having a spinal cord stimulator put in next week for the massive nerve pain from my foot and they aren't putting me out. Just giving me a Valium and I also get zero pain meds. I know 3 people that have had this same thing done to them and they are say it's super painful and you have to wear all of this stuff for a week. It's the trial then if it works, you get it put in permanently. They do absolutely nothing for the pain I have been in. I warn anyone, DO NOT COME HERE!!! So not only am I in a lot of pain with my foot 24/7 now I'm going to be in pain with this thing in my back for a week. You are seriously treaded like a number, or a inconveniences. I hate this Dr office.|I have been coming to this clinic for going on three years and today I must say is the worst experience that I've ever had in my life dealing with a doctor and office receptionist. It was hard enough being told that there was nothing else that they could do for me when they haven't done anything but prescribe me medication that's for people that overuse their medicine. But after I see the doctor And then I walk out of the office limping face full of tears and nobody did anything. I also informed the doctor that my legs had swollen up so much to the point where I couldn't even wear shoes almost and she said absolutely nothing mind you this is a doctor that has never seen me before. So I went out to my car and calm down and try to find another pain specialist, then I went back in to see if they could write me a referral to a new doctor and I stood there for a total of almost 20 minutes. I was purposely left in the waiting area I knocked on the door nobody came, all the nurses and everyone else in the office I saw walking back-and-forth. Then when the receptionist finally decided to come out after I just decided to stand there and make a phone call to the office, I had to yell hello excuse me is anybody going to come out and help me. Then the receptionist finally comes out and is very very rude as if I've done something to her then she rudely tells me that they will not give me a referral or that they can't give me a referral. This was done on purpose and I was left in the waiting room for no apparent reason at all. This is very unacceptable and I will not tolerate being treated like that no one should have to especially when you're in excruciating pain in a doctors office. I would not recommend anyone go to this office at all under any circumstance. Please look through your options of a pain clinic and do not go to this one. I am deeply hurt and upset by the way that I was treated.|I've had two bad experiences with Kali Thibault, PA-C. She is rude, condescending, likes to argue and speak down to her patients and has a horrible bedside manner.  I will never see this provider again, and I would not recommend her to anyone.|I have been being cared for By Dr. Vo. He is an excellent Physician.
Well respected by all hospital staff.
He is a very patient person. Super responsive and up on all the latest technology available to patients.
He is not easy to get into because he is very much in demand as this is a much needed Specialty in Medicine.
Once you become an established patient you will not be sorry for the wait. So be patient please.
He does not rush you in and out ever.
He extremely thorough and conscientious.
St. Clare's is a very good facility to be seen at as again, you are not rushed in and out. All staff is very respectful and excellent communicators.
I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Vo or St Clare's.
You won't ever regret the experience.
I am a Registered Nurse of over 40 years experience. I know great Healthcare practitioners as I have been fortunate to have worked with many. Dr Vo is very exceptionally gifted. A really hard worker and smart worker.
Thanks

The entire staff is friendly, engaging, knowledgeable and respectful of patients' time.  They take a holistic approach to patients' care and look for underlying issues rather than just treating symptoms.  They are honest and present realistic expectations.  In just a few months, I achieved more results and understanding of my condition than years spent working through my HMO.  They also provide support and guidance to help you maintain good health at home after treatments.  Definitely the best care I have ever received!|Bellevue Pain Institute provided exceptional treatment and care for me as I struggled with an L4/L5 herniated disc. I had been dealing with pain for almost six months before finding BPI and seeing multiple doctors and specialists with no success. It was not until Dr. Polzin was able to take a deeper look at my MRI that I realized the severity of my issue. Dr. Polzin and his team were able to put a plan together not only to help fix my disc issue but also to provide me with the knowledge and tools to help prevent further injury in the future. After four months of treatment, I am now stronger than I've ever been and excited to live my life without constantly worrying about my back pain. I am beyond grateful for the entire staff at BPI, and I can't recommend them enough if you are struggling to find a solution for your back pain.

Thank you BPI!|I recently experienced vertigo for the first time. After several days of the terrible spinning sensation, I sought relief with Dr.Polzin at the Pain Institute in Bellevue. He performed the Epley maneuver on me. The next morning, I was able to sit up in bed without vertigo. He also advised me about Vitamins D and K, and how they affect the crystals in my ears.
I'm very grateful for the work of Dr. Polzin.|I am a 68-year-old man who was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in both feet of unclear origin. I am tall and thin, which may be relevant, and I experienced discomforting sensations of pins and needles in both feet, which disrupted my sleep. As an active runner, biker, and rower, I was deeply concerned about the potential long-term impact of this condition. Fortunately, I was referred to Drs. Patti Mullen and Kevin Polzin at the Bellevue Pain Institute.

I underwent 16 NeoGen treatments (two per week), during which both feet were electrically stimulated to promote neuro-muscular growth. Additionally, I received local injections of B-12 and oral supplements to stimulate blood flow in my feet, along with neuromuscular re-education, which involved manual stimulation of various regions on my feet and legs.

Although I was initially skeptical--being a brain scientist, I doubted that my symptoms could be reversed at my age--I am thrilled to report that, over the course of several months, my discomfort and pain completely disappeared! Objective measures, including assessments of blood flow, pain sensitivity, and both cold/hot and pressure sensitivity, all confirmed that I am now cured of my polyneuropathy.

I am absolutely overjoyed with this outcome and would like to express my deepest gratitude to Drs. Polzin and Mullen, as well as to their team members--Drs. Greg Cofano, Kaitlyn Burnette, and Holly Sternod. I truly appreciate the enthusiasm, knowledge, and care they demonstrated throughout my treatment.

Thank you again for your exceptional support. I am deeply grateful for the positive impact this treatment has had on my life.

Former Professor of biology and engineering at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena|For over a year, I suffered with a herniated disc at L5/S1 causing severe back and sciatic pain.  I tried every treatment under the sun with little to no success, then I found Dr Polzin.  The talented team at Bellevue Pain Institute uses cutting edge technology and provided a comprehensive treatment plan that restored me to normal function and has all but eliminated my pain.  I cannot recommend them enough!|If you have any pain caused from back or neck trauma, this AMAZING team will ensure they do everything they can to get you feeling better! From the second you walk through the door, you will immediately feel like family. Maddie and Christina are incredible at making sure that you know they care.

Dr. Polzin, Dr. Cofano, Dr. Burnette, and Dr. Brown are all absolutely incredible. They take the time to get to know each person they treat. I think the entire team had my name memorized by my 2nd visit.

I simply cannot say enough about how great this team is. I (barely) walked into this office with severe back pain and leg numbness/burning. After about 3 months of treatment, I would say I'm at 95% back to normal. They gave me my quality of life back.

I would highly recommend you go in for a consultation if your pain is interfering with your daily routine. You will quickly find that there's no better team in the medical industry than this one at the Bellevue Pain Institute.
Thank you also to Blayke and good luck with your new endeavor!
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!|My first appointment was about what pain I have as to why I was there.  Then I was off to get full body Xrays at Bellevue Imaging.
My second appointment then showed me the cost, payment plans, etc. for what was seen on the Xrays and a taste of the manipulations that would be required 3 times a week !  Then they put on a back brace with an ice pack.
Sticker shock on the cost was my first thought until they said to get better would require manipulations 3 times a week, which an hour+ drive each way was a deal breaker.  I did ask if I could return the back brace knowing it was going to be ridiculously expensive and  was told no.....turned out it was a $200 back brace that you can certainly get elsewhere for under $50.
All that was just step one of 3....cha ching !
I would not recommend this place based on what seemed to be an extremely costly venture without much assurance for success and the fact insurance doesn't cover a large portion ESPECIALLY THE OVERPRICED BACK BRACE.  BE WARNED.|I have been debating on writing this.
I am actually very disappointed in this facility overall.
I had to take out a huge loan to get this treatment. I will have a large monthly payment for 6 years.
Although many of the employees are great.  The main doctor seems to be after payment,  and not truly care for the client.  In my experience.
After following their protocols to a T. Getting my treatments on time.   I had essentially no improvement.
Once my 3 months of treatment ended, because the thousands of dollars I paid wasn't enough.  They basically said see ya.  I think I needed a longer duration of treatment,  not their 3 month protocol.

His compassion for his patient is minimal. His office staff haven't been much help either. Getting scripts has been a nightmare. Have missed doses several times because they don't transfer the information to the pharmacy.
Have been battling to get records, labs,and images to a different dr. They have been extremely difficult and simply don't care about making this transition easy.
Did our homework on the new Doctor and will be a welcome change to have a doctor and office staff care for the patient instead of just caring about their money|Dr. Kim is one of the best doctors in the PNW. He is thorough and never rushes the appointment. Several weeks ago I had a pinched nerve flare up that left me in severe pain. He scheduled me for the next day and did an epidural injection that took the pain away immediately. He was gentle, quick and always made sure I was comfortable. His staff is A+ and kind. Thank you to everyone there.|I had an electronic paintrial July 2012, then a pain pump installed August 2012. Dr was extremely helpful, exceptionally nice and took great care of me until April 2014 when I moved out of state.
I see the negative reviews and wonder how much demand these people are putting on the professional,  who has spent years taking care of, seeing the character of patients who may be pushing the limit on what they're looking for.  Are they telling doctor what they want or are they looking for the best options available. Meaning; are they drug seeking? I've been u enough clinics and seen enough drug seekers to understand what doctors are up against. When a patient is so negatively reviewing, it makes me wonder if they couldn't get what they 'wanted'. Just my opinion, I personally loved doctor and he did wonders for me, titrating me down from high doses of medications to minimal in my pain pump, exactly where I needed it the most. Evil, come on, give me a break!|Dr. Kim is a magnificent in his specialty and a very kind man. I am very happy he is my Doctor. Warm Regards, Christina Moore|He isn't a caring dr.

I'm super happy that I found this practice and couldn't be happier with him.  I recommend Dr Taylor for anyone who is in need of spinal care.|Dr Taylor and team were efficient, kind and professional. Dr Taylor took time to review updated plan, was gentle and respectful in manner. In the treatment room he and his team were explaining step by step, advising when something was going to be uncomfortable and completed with the goal of my safety and comfort met.
Dr. Taylor checked in post procedure with a referral for continuing care. He took all the time I needed to answer questions and assure I had contact information for concerns.|Dr Taylor and his team were so incredibly kind!! I was very nervous for my procedure. They talked me through every step and constantly reassured me with kind words. I have never had such a positive medical experience and I cannot give enough praise.

He is the nicest Dr. I have ever known. I will always ask to see him. My arm's, hand's, had no issues this weekend driving. The neck injection definitely helped. Ty so much. James Mcphetridge.|Found Dr. Taylor very personable, professional. I felt he listened to me when gathering my history of pain and in his planning the course of action he felt best for me. Had my first shot in back yesterday and the pain is lower today. We'll wait and see how I do the next few weeks. I'm hopeful.|I saw Dr. Taylor once for a referral on a long, ten year issue with my lumbar spine. I have previous spent years at UW spine center in Seattle where I had countless procedures done, including an RFA, until I gave up and decided to live in pain. Dr. Taylor came in with a new patient intake that he had handwritten all over. It was very obvious that he had had researched my extensive history. Took him 3 minutes to tell me I needed a fusion, which I had been begging to get for years at UW.

I am very grateful that he took the time to review my history and current mri. Seems reasonable that this would be something that a physician would do with any patient, but I have not found this to be the case in my ten years of dealing with this life changing issue.

Pleasant, direct, knowledgeable  and efficient with my time. What more can you ask for?|Dr. Taylor is simply the best  I had 2 injectios in the back and he is so gentle trying to keep the discomfort minimal. I cannot say enough good about Dr. Taylor.|THE ABSOLUTE WORST PAIN DOCTOR I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH!

Dr. Taylor was engaged and great for the first couple of months. However, the longer I was a patient the worse his serve and support helped me.  There have been numerous times I was scheduled for appointments only to discover those appointments we cancelled.  Since the travel time for me is over 90 minutes one way for my appointmens, this was simply unacceptable.
I worked with him on getting approved for a spinal cord Stimulater. This was the solution that he and the surgeon both directed me to. The first request for insurance approval we denied but he assured me that we just needed to complete the items insurance wanted (multiple physical therapy appointments).  Once completed, his team resubmitted for insurance. This too was denied and my attempts to find time for an appointment with him never happened. After speaking with my new pain management team, it seems clear that he did not work hard enough to get this approved. Instead they simply resubmitted the insurance request. If this stimulater was truly the right solution, I think he should have been working on my behalf to show this was the right solution. Instead I have received multiple calls from his office with the same message over and over...""we want to let you know your stimulater was denied"".
Having to deal with this pain for years and worked with other pain management tears, I can honestly say that Dr. Adams is the worst team I have worked with.",2025-02-25|2025-01-07|2025-01-03|2025-02-02|2024-12-31|2025-01-09|2025-01-14|2024-08-02,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","My experience was great.

Before seeing Dr. Wu, I was struggling with debilitating pain in my lower back. I had even seen a neurologist who dismissed my pain as muscular and suggested I buy a massaging tool! Thankfully, I was referred to the pain clinic at Roosevelt and saw Dr. Wu. Unlike the neurologist, Dr. Wu actually listened to my concerns and ordered imaging.  This led to the proper diagnosis of a cyst in my lumbar spine that was pinching a nerve.
Dr. Wu administered two steroid injections which significantly reduced my pain, and then he referred me to physical therapy. I'm incredibly grateful to him for his accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan.
My only criticism is the requirement for a driver and someone to wait during the injections.  While I understand this protocol is necessary, it creates a significant barrier for patients like me who lack a support system. I hope the clinic can develop a solution for this issue in the future.
Despite this, I give Dr. Wu 5 stars. He's a skilled and compassionate physician who truly cares about his patients.|This place is an absolute joke. Months to get in for appointments and half the time they cancel them without warning. I had a procedure done at this clinic. I was supposed to have a 3 month follow up to then do another procedure. But it was cancelled without warning. My doctor left. They then rescheduled me, 4 months out. That appointment was cancelled without warning. Now, another 4 months before I can get back in. Rendering the first procedure worthless. This place is so disorganized it's incredible.|I went a few years ago and I have had this chronic pain since giving birth to my second son when they had difficulty placing the epidural. When I went to them they informed they do no medication for pain and I just needed to lose weight. Then I went to a spine Dr through the U and they also said if I lost weight it would help oh so much like being fat was my entire problem. Well guess what lost the weight 235 pounds down to 150 and I still struggle from the pain. I had to fight to try an injection which they finally gave believing it wouldn't help and it did. They are so consumed by looking at u and making assumptions that everything is about weight they do not look at the bigger picture. My spine dr at the U currently is alot better now that I'm a lower weight and that clearly was not the problem. This review is just to remind Dr's that losing weight doesn't always solve the problem and they need to look at the whole picture.|I thought this would be the place for supervised administration of opiates for pain relief even in this age of temperance, but I was told to try turmeric or acupuncture, despite a history of trying most everything else. THEY DON'T PRESCRIBE OPIATES, a medicine known to Hippocrates. This place is a mind-boggling example of humbuggery at its finest. Turmeric? It's almost impossible to believe the suggestion came from the mouth of someone with an MD.|Legit waiting for my appointment to start and don't even want to be here. Lack of communication as to when I was supposed to be there, causing me an hour of waiting for them to decide they're ready to see me. Navigating to get here is literally like just hope you get to the right place. Another place you're forced to pay to park at for your own Health. I'm ready to leave and the appointment hasn't even started. Also less than welcoming front desk staff what's the point. Seriously- thanks folks for making me feel extremely insignificant right away lol. I'm outta here.

Revised to 4 Stars:

Despite the confusing and frustrating beginning- the providers were very kind. But there needs to be a bit more clear communication for patients to understand and adjust accordingly.

-Paying to park for appointments really is a way to continue to run people dry and add extra financial burden to their appointments. Thus, making people not want to have appointments as much as they may need.
-The signage is extremely confusing between the two locations and hard to decipher. When I got into the elevator I couldn't even find a descriptor that said ""Lobby"" on a sign. You were apparently just supposed to know even though the 1 button has rubbed off so much you almost can't see it.
-Running a pain clinic does mean you deal with people in pain, which is why clear communication and also providing good customer service is important. Pain can make it even harder to keep every detail perfect and together- so the expectations for patients should be realistic in that regard- just as we try to have those realistic expectations for our providers. But I felt like a lot of detail was left out of what my expectations should be for arriving here at this clinic. They certainly don't make it easy to find.

As a person struggling with pain AND also working previously in healthcare, the ""onboarding"" experience of this clinic still needs work. There is nothing wrong with providing details- tell your patients what they need to know so they can have a smoother experience. As I said previously- the provider made the experience feel more worth it. But otherwise I would have not made my second appointment.|DO NOT SEE DR. POWELSON
A student performed the procedure with the Powelson in the room. When they started the procedure, I svresmed out in pain, because I could feel EVERYTHING. I literally had to ask for pain. It was extremely traumatic. Still having flashbacks.
SHE IS THE WORST!|Don't go here if you're overweight.  My appointment lasted around 50 minutes but the doctor was only in the room for the last 8-10 minutes.  First I met with the nurse.  Then I met with a student doctor, explained everything, she went to discuss with the doctor before Dr. Rana Al-Jumah finally came in.  Throughout the process I genuinly participated in the process.  I talked about what I've done to try to manage the pain, what movements cause the pain.  I answered all of their quesitons.  In the end the doctor told me I needed to exercise and lose weight.

She did not ask me what I do for exercise or if I exercise.

She did not ask me what efforts I make to lose weight.

She did not ask me how/if the pain impacts my ability to exercise.

She saw an overweight person and simply judged that the only answer was that I needed to lose weight.  She made no effort to actually evaluate what causes my pain.  I've never felt fat shamed by a doctor before this experience.  My experience with Dr. Rana Al-Jumah was one of the worst I've had with a medical provider and I will never go back to this clinic.

If the types of treatments this clinic provides wouldn't be a good fit for the type of pain I'm experiencing, she could have simply said that.  She isn't a PCP.  She isn't a wight management doctor.  She isn't a physical therapist.  She shouldn't give opinions about areas of healthcare she clearly knows nothing about.|Don't go here basically. I was recommended a spine specialist via my PCP. The spine specialist turned me to the pain clinic. I ended up getting Dr. Wu. He has to be one of the the WORST Doctor's I have ever had. He wasn't willing to do anything for me and actually made my pain worse because he kept poking my back where the pain was!

I decided to get a second opinion/new doctor there...well don't try doing that. They have to ""send it to the higher up's"" to get approved. When it finally DID get approved, I got a new appointment...4 months away. I'm in pain NOW.

I said to heck with the UW and looked for other options. Turns out CHI Franciscan has a Pain Management Clinic at St. Clare is Lakewood, WA. I got an appointment within a few weeks and I'm about to have my first steroid injection a month after my first appointment with them (that's more on my insurance then them.). The team was also VERY caring, great bedside manners, the doctor actually LISTENED to me!!!! Do you know how it felt finally having a doctor listen to me after getting the run around by UW doctors? I almost cried.

If I could give zero stars...I would.",2024-12-16|2025-02-04|2024-09-26|2025-01-04|2024-05-28|2024-09-14|2024-04-11|2023-06-13,4|1|1|1|4|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Are you accepting new patients and do you accept state ins.  ?","You need a referral from a University of Washington Medical Center provider",convenient_clinic_location|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJIwGFQfQUkFQR15wE-v4U_Cc,46

She actually listened to me, and is helping me. She hasn't been rude and dismissive to me like many other doctors I've seen since I got hit by a truck walking home from work. It's taken 14 years to find her. Looking forward to improving my quality of life with her.|My significant other got a referral from her PCP for this clinic and called to schedule an appt. The receptionist told her ""after reviewing your charts, we are unable to help you and there is nothing we can do for you "" SHE HAS NOT EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR AT THIS CLINIC!!! How can a place tell someone they can't help them without even an initial appt?!?!?!

Maybe it's due to the doctor who wrote the referral and left out pertinent info. But all I know is that she has multiple MRI scans, documented medical issues, etc. After a back injury left her with multiple slipped discs, severe cervical spine damage, right shin permanent tissue damage how can a clinic say they can't help her when she has never been seen by them before?????? She cannot even walk 20 feet without the use of crutches due to her pain!!! It is so bad that I have had to become her caregiver because she cannot fully take care of herself on a daily basis. This is absolutely mind boggling to me that they are so quick to deny someone any help without being seen first. I guess now all of the negative reviews for this place finally make sense.|This is not a pain clinic they don't do anything for you!!! I've been in excruciating pain for the last year and they have done nothing for me. And I have major back surgery in 2 days! No pain relief from them!!!!!|Worst pain doctor thinks he is the best is a surgical hack wants to make money on procedures and give out pills no alternative treatments no newer treatments .
Stay away he will hurt you then no medicine for your pain . He shouldn't be a pain doctor most unprofessional doctor I have dealt with.  Good read his health grades you would see or any of the doctor review sites has 2 stars and 30 to 50 complaints .
He hurt my friend that has real structural pain|Front desk staff is rude, theres signs all across the lobby saying they can refuse your treatment for any reason, and they signed me up for spam emails. I don't remember giving them permission to do that.

To top it all off they were very firm about how they would contact me when they had a care plan together for me, but that never happened. A full month of radio silence later and I had to call to find out they decided they can't help me. They won't tell me why. They claimed they sent a letter to my doctor, but my doctor never got it so... I just spent a month in debilitating pain for no reason. Thanks.

Find another clinic if you can. There's nothing for you here.|Dr. Burkey was extremely reluctant to clarify concerns and questions even though every person I interacted with directed me to him for concerns and questions. Odd right? According to him, asking questions and being concerned about conflicting information was ""attacking"" him. He was extremely condescending, gas lit me, and took no responsibility for lack of and false information. The only reason my husband and I stayed was because I'm in desperate pain and needed the possible help since I've waited 7 months. Felt extremely uncomfortable and broke down in tears before, during, and after the operation. My follow up is not even with him or anyone who was present during my two procedures. All I wanted to know was what the procedure was, how it would go, and what i could expect afterwards. The after care paperwork was changed after my first visit to reflect pertinent information that was missing, like how long it could actually take the operation to go into effect. Long story short, will never be seen my Dr. Burkey again and you shouldn't either.|This place is incredible! Everyone there is so nice and professional. Dr Bourke is heaven sent after talking with him on my first visit it was a breath of fresh air. He knew and understood what was happening to me unlike any other doctor me and my husband were so pleased who knew what he was talking about.. I've seen bad reviews but I can't see how those are true. They are all an amazing group of people to work with. Even the ladies who answer when you call they are so pleasant. I had a procedure and they were so empathetic and caring. Anesis deserves to get recognition for their incredible customer service. Thanks to everyone there for making it a pleasant experience.|Dr. Burkey has a very ""holier-than-thou"" disposition and his patient care is extremely unprofessional and uncaring... My mother is a pain medication dependant person due to inoperable fractures in her back. Dr. Burkey suggested a nerve stimulating implant that my mother declined because of numerous risks that DO NOT outweigh the possible benefit of surgery. She has been on the same low dose of medication for over 3 years and we have struggled the entire time to get her stable on that dose with her level of pain so she requested an increase and was then was emotionally degraded by Dr Burkey. He then said that maybe we should find someone else and I agreed, then he got up and walked out and was going to let her go through possibly deadly withdrawals without a new prescription. In the end he gave her a one month prescription and said ""you have 28 days to find someone else"".  Not the place you want to go if you want to be listened to and your needs taken into consideration without being treated like a less-than-human. If you don't want their surgery, prepare to eventually find someone else to help with your pain management.

He has a truly knowledgeable, compassionate, bedside manner. He takes the time to listen to my concerns and continues to patiently work with me, which is rare in this day and age. He has made a positive difference in my continued journey to wellness.
His office has a clean, friendly, welcoming vibe. His receptionist always greets me with a smile and makes me feel valued as a patient. Another rare quality.
I'm fortunate my PCP recommended Kirkland Spine Care.|The Dr. Is ok but the front desk lady, ""Prissy"" is a vindictive snatch ! She's inept and refuses to take responsibility for her own mistakes. Mistakes that cause people a great deal of stress and complications. If you mention something she did incorrectly and ask for her help to fix it, she blacklists you and all  but cuts you off, Making it near impossible to see the Dr. This woman needs to be fired! Look at the other reviews, she sucks! Get rid of this liability Dr. Oh.!!!|I have been a patient of Dr. Oh for about four years now and can honestly say he is a life saver. A doctor that actually listens AND cares is hard to find, luckily Dr Oh is both compassionate and listens. Whenever there has been a billing issue the staff works with me until it's resolved. The negative reviews are surprising because I've had the exact opposite experiences for four years. Dr Oh is an expert on addiction and can tell the difference between pill seekers and people who suffer from real chronic pain.
I would give Dr Oh and staff 10 stars if possible|He's Amazing! he's been my doctor for years & he is always kind & caring, he goes above & beyond to help me with my complex health & pain concerns. Wait times are quick, easy to get an appointment & he educates his patients about pain management & other options for pain relief. Dr. Oh uses a compassionate approach to managing care. He also is extremely educated in addiction and provides an in depth understanding of how to manage pain in the most healthy way possible. He truly is a doctor who cares about his patients.

I highly recommend Dr. Oh. Thank You Dr. Oh, Mrs. Oh & Priscy:)|I have seen Dr. Oh for 5 years now. He is absolutely the best doctor I have ever seen.

As a patient who has struggled with severe upper cervical spine and hip joint pain for many years I had a very hard time achieving stability through pain management.

Dr Oh is extremely educated in many areas. He has spent allot of time reviewing my CT's and MRI's. He takes extra time to explain everything that he sees. He is very thorough in his exams.

I was referred by my spine surgeon to
Dr. Oh after I went through upper cervical fission surgery and have had some progressive complications a few years after my surgery.

Dr. Oh uses a compassionate approach to managing care. He also is extremely educated in addiction and provides an in depth understanding of how to manage pain in the most healthy way possible.

He truly is a doctor who cares about his patients. If I could give 10 stars I would. He is definitely a five star ""plus"" doctor.

I am honestly very grateful to have found my way into his care.
I recommend Dr. Oh to everyone I come across that needs a Really good pain management doctor.

What total incompetence to not realize that a patient owes money for 3 years. We had moved 2.5 years ago so they had wrong address. They sent bill to collections. We did have address forwarded for 1 yr so if they had sent a bill then I would have received.  I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to.|We need more physicians like Dr. Oh! He cares, listens but doesn't put up with any shenanigans. Mrs. Oh and Priscy keep the office running and I can tell you as someone who has been a patient since 1997, I have not always liked what I have heard and I am not the easiest patient either. I tend to over do things and then I pay for it. As far as the billing, take some personal responsibility. You should be monitoring your Explanation of Benefits (EOB), if you do not see the charges, call your insurance and the doctor you saw. We are all human and we make mistakes. Maybe the most recent card is not on file or an address or change has taken place. Dr. Oh has been a leader in reducing the amount of narcotics in our community and again personal responsibility plays a huge part. I am thankful for that!

She wasn't the least bit compassionate or sincere. I was another ""bread and butter"" patient. That she thought she was going to manage the symptoms but never get to the source. She also made it very clear that narcotic drugs don't help long term. Well duh..I worked addiction recovery and I wasn't asking for them!!! Another stigma in this world. I have sufferred for years because this has happened so many times I quit reaching out for help. I stood up and told her I was done and her bedside manner was the worst I have ever encountered, and walked out. If you are not typical patient and understand this is not a healing system but a medical system that doesn't want to get to the cause because as soon as she deals with the cause her ""bread and butter"" would be gone. I feel sorry that my insurance companies have to pay for a sorry excuse called care. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.|If I could give her a ZERO I would! One of the v worst providers that I have seen! Kind of goes hand and hand with the Everett Clinic!  She told me that I didn't have the pain that I said that I did although I ended up having a neck operation as well as a shoulder/bicep repair as the result of ONE accident! When the Everett Clinic was bought out by Davita in 2015 the care of the patients was forgotten. I was on a merry -go-around with I believe 13 different doctors because one doctor said one thing and another said something else. My primary doctor cared and tried but said ""I can't overrule another doctor"".
The writing was on the wall in the MRI of my shoulder and of my neck courtesy of the EVERETT CLINIC.  And I was passed around like cattle. It took over 2 years before I was fixed and it was fixed OUTSIDE of the Everett Clinic. I about had a nervous breakdown because of the pain. I expected her to actually treat me lolol silly me ! I have wrote letters and have made numerous calls regarding the level of care. But this provider could have and should have eased my pain!

I see the EVERETT CLINIC sold again recently, I can't imagine why??!!!
The clinic USED to be one of the best in the country. I have been a patient there my entire life so I know what I am talking about. All it has become now is Cha Ching! "" Give me your money and I'm sending you to another specialist to get even more money"" seems to be their motto.  I would suggest anyone who has a real problem to look at their reviews especially when you start being sent to one doctor after another. They are rated an F with the BBB for a reason.|Concerned with the direction this clinic is taking since I've received a new pain management doctor.

At Electrodiagnosis and Musculoskeletal Associates of Puget Sound, his expertise and compassionate care stood out from the moment I walked into the clinic.

Dr. Saeed has treated my back pain with steroid injections and ablation therapy. His approach was thorough--he took the time to explain each step of the treatment, answer my questions, and ensure I felt confident and comfortable before, during and after treatments.

The treatments reduced my pain and improved my quality of life. Dr. Saeed's precision and dedication to his patients are remarkable. It's clear that he is not only highly skilled but also genuinely cares about helping people regain their mobility and live pain-free.

Each visit to the clinic my experiences with their entire team have always been professional, kind, and efficient. Appointments were easy to schedule, and the environment was welcoming and supportive. If you're dealing with chronic pain and seeking a knowledgeable and compassionate provider, I highly recommend Dr. Kashif Saeed and his team.

Thank you, Dr. Saeed!|Don't get me wrong, the Dr. Was Excellent. It was for the receptionists that this review is poorly rated. The first thing I noticed is that the waiting room had old delapitated furniture and there was a lot of giggling behind the counter. I was properly greeted and given direction on how to use the code for the restroom. On my return, I noticed that the waiting room was pretty full. Now, after I had been sitting in the waiting room for 42 minutes-one of the receptionists called my first name and said ""the Dr. Is running behind and the people next to you will be going next so if you want to reschedule you can.""

First, I took off work so I could be seen which means unlike her in her customer service based position, I was not getting paid to wait. I should not out of courtesy had to wait 45 minutes to find out that I was possibly going to have to reschedule, and if I was seen today that I would be thrust into rush hour traffic for my 45 minute drive home.

More giggling and then the antics (the heavyset blonde- peeking over her monitor & quietly whispering amongst mainly her and 1 other receptionist, along with sideways glances followed by more giggling until the blonde gal finally turned off her computer and left for home.

At that time all was quiet but it was too late to salvage any attempts at respectable relations apparently because when I went to the counter to make my follow up appointment, the 2nd receptionist (heavyset Spanish gal) started to come to the counter and then took 2 steps in reverse, smiling with her head down. So subsequently the main receptionist (dark skin h/w/p gal whom had also helped me with the bathroom code earlier) helped to scheduled my next visit at their other location (thank goodness).

It was unfortunately not the only instance in witness of this poor receptionist behavior, my prior visit with my boyfriend whom was in attendance with me weeks before truly left a bitter impression for him as well.

The reception staff should be trained that the patients are not there for their amusement and should be treated with the utmost respect because YOUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON IT.

I just left feeling disappointed, hurt, and bullied. It's your decision if you want to go here, best of luck.|They refuse to bill my insurance even though it's one of the excepted ones. Not to mention I was told by someone there that no surgeon would touch my injury & a second opinion resulted in a much needed surgery 2 months later. I'd skip this place if you can.|After first visit I was extremely disappointed. After being in pain for 8yrs with chronic pain from Fibromyalgia the only options I was given where aids that where going to cost me out of pocket which I cannot afford. And physical therapy which at 3 days a week is unrealistic for me. (I've gone over this with my pcp) After 3 years of fighting for a Pain Management Referral I had sought out a clinic that offered many different options for pain and was hopeful..... after, I see now and am understanding more and more why people simply give up and turn to allocate drugs. I've never once been prescribed opioids for my Fibromyalgia however I wouldn't be opposed if It meant I could stand longer than 20min at a time. However much like everwhere else they would much rather put you on Gabapentin and misuse it as a pain reliever when it is not. I'm already on extremely high doses. I was expecting a combination of medications and injections just to start to get me to where I can begin getting better and move twords physical therapy. You have to walk before your expected to run. But I'm simply exhausted telling Doctors my body hurts all over and being told sorry.... Basically it's up to your own will power to make your body move and work through the pain, which after 8yrs I have non left. I can't push myself through my most painful days anymore. It took me years to get this far downhill and it's going to take me time to get better.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you have Fibromyalgia. Their solution will be physical therapy & Gabapentin(both of which can be done through your PCP). Save yourself the heartache thinking you will get any relief or help and look elsewhere.|The reason for 3 stars is because customer service is awful. They never answer the phone. They rarely return calls when I leave voicemail messages. Big receptionist with blond streak is horrid and rude. I stepped in front of her and stated my name and doctor I was scheduled to see. She turned to her computer, looking at it for a long time. I thought she was looking at the schedule and almost asked if there was mixup or problem when she picks up her phone and starts to make phone calls. The other other receptionist looks at me then asks the blonde if she was  helping me. Her response was no, I thought you were. If the blonde doesn't want to receive or help clients then she should get another job, she is unprofessional and surly. Dr. Mordus and assistant Kylie are both pleasant.|I am so glad I chose to come here instead of the place I was originally referred to. They had horrible reviews so there was no way I was going there. EMA was so great, everyone was super nice. I ended up being 30 mins late for my appt and they still saw me, and their attitude didn't change towards me like other places I've been.

And the clinic manager is impossible to get a hold of, never returning phonw calls. When you do finally get ahold of her she doesn't keep to her word. As a CRPS patient I should be able to trust and communicate with my doctors and that is not the case with this office staff. After years of trying to be heard I mentioned going else where and I was immediately discharged with no back up plan for my chronic pain management.  You would think people in this field of work would have a little more compassion and imo this office is just there to make their money and go home. They do not care about what's going on with their patients at all.|""Dr"" Yu is the WORST doctor I have ever seen in my life. He is rude, arrogant, and has the worst bed side manners. At one visit he said that's the medicine your taking and don't talk to me about it again. I couldn't believe it. He literally could care less about his patients. He also has the personality of a rock. STAY AWAY AT ALL COST. I will be filing a formal complaint at the hospital he works at.|After 40 years of lower lumbar surgery and the chronic pain associated with scoliosis surgery I was referred to Dr Yu. For pain management. The visit was like any other and he indicated that I would require and injection in my lower spin to help ease the multiple compound fractures and bones spurs I acquired over the years. He said I'd need an MRI /CT Scan to see if my spine is even supported from the broken hardware. A few days later I called to make those appointments come to find out he never put the order in for the spinal injection or the MRI /CT Scan. How does this happen? Seriously all my specialist are at Swedish and this is the first I have questions about. SMH|Dr Yu should not be in pain management. he is rude and can't wait to be done with your appointment. I just recently asked him to take me off of the fentynal patch and try something else. So he puts me on. 5 mg of oxycodone 4 times a day. It's nowhere near the pain relief I used to get and need. But he doesn't care. He doesn't want to listen to you . He actually told me that the reason he lowered the amount was because I was recently diagnosed with fibermyalgia and that pain medications don't work for that. Is this guy a complete sumbass??? Does he forget that I've been seeing him for 6 years now for lower back pain and we have discussed a spine stimulator. And he forgets about my neck and shoulder pain and the fact that I need another siak removed at some point. So both of these are pre-oexisting issues and have nothing to do with fibermyalgia he doesn't lay in bed most days and stare at the wall crying ,..............,,|Dr. Glen David and his team are excellent. They are competent, compassionate, polite and have consistently listened to my concerns. They have addressed any questions I have with clear explanations.|This facility is an inappropriate location to seek care for management of your severe pain.

You will immediately be treated as a drug addict, your objective medical history will utterly be disregarded, and your doctor's word is law- they do not allow you to see another provider if you didn't gel with the first one.

The staff, from doctors to nurses act with impunity to the point it is absolutely outrageous. I've never been talked to like that in my adult lifetime. It seems they've learned they can get away with anything (behavior that would get any other medical professional fired or lose their license) because any complaints or malpractice committed by this staff is instantly disregarded as ""drug seeking behavior"", when perhaps you were merely seeking the tools to deliver your life back to you, or perhaps just trying to better understand about what all of your options may be.

These people just don't get it, and I cry when I think about the incalculable amount of pain and suffering wrongly endured by those that have walked in, and back out, of these doors without answers or relief. But hey, if you want a lidocaine injection to take care of your pain for about an hour or two, feel free to book an appointment here (6 weeks out from now), and get ready to sit in their waiting room for several hours while they scrutinize your urine before they even allow you to talk with a provider.|The staff is friendly and efficient. It's quiet, pretty setting.  Dr Yu is helpful thinking of what's best for me.

Disabling sciatic pain/numbness from disc herniation over a year means you want someone to go straight to what works instead of going through hoops and hurdles. Dr. McGuire did just that and was as direct as could be. No sugar coating anything. No fake pity party. Options laid out clearly and a step plan made for options at first appointment. Just straight to what needed to be done and got it done right. The injection he performed was much more effective than the first one I had at a different facility.|Went in for pain management and left my appointment with Dr. Olsen feeling very alone and unheard. Absolutely zero medication to help. This office only wants to do injections. I was told when I got there it was only interventional treatment. Don't waste your time. Particularly Dr. Olsen.|I was referred to Dr. Olssen by my PCP. Had an appointment with him on Dec 29.  In the meantime, I had a second, botched back surgery, and he told me I was prescribed a medication that was not acceptable while on pain mgt so he refused to treat me until I saw my Dr again. Months went by, some follow ups later, pain mgt office contacted me to schedule another appointment, weeks later, not with Olssen. At that appointment, the dr got a is,sent message to my PCP to refill pain meds for 2wks, and scheduled another appointment for 2wks out. Waited in endurance what seemed like forever for this, we'll see what happens next.|I was referred to Dr Olsson by a internist that practices in the office that I saw my doc to whom left suddenly. When my doctor disappeared I found it a monthly
Challenge to refill the medications that I need to be able to comfortable enough to move, I catered to there wishes of taking all the meds that helped me get thru and move.when I asked for replacement.  meds I was ignored.I get to doctor olsson and on my 1st appt, he told me in a abrasive voice I had a mental issue, I asure you I do not furthermore Not sure of his degree.Then he said he wanted xrays to see if I have arthur!! All this info along with 7 Maris are in my file and he obviously had spent zero time looking at my records. I well add cost me thousands as I did not want to live in pain and had done every thing in my power to get out of it
his bedside manner was horrific.Chi has cared for my conditions for many years. Trusting I would be cared for I put my thoughts aside and continued on to the pain center.
Nxt appt was seen by a Dr McCarthy whom informed me olsson was going to lower my dose 20%note its been several months that any doctor asked about my pain levels ect. And I stayed quiet because I knew they did not care to deal with CHRONIC PAIN.MEDICATIONS.
I made my appt for .november and it was moved too dec, so when I had to call for my refill meds...as crazy as it is I was as used of cancelling my Nov appt and he would not refill my medication. I broke down and told the nurse it was against FDA RULES to do such to anyone. So then he agreed if I came in for a UA. He'd fill my meds.I gladly did so. He called my meds in telling me to take 20 tablets every four hours of course it wasn't filled after many calls to his office he called my meds in but took 100
Tablets away 85%. I will contact chi franscan about my experience
When I called about my meds not being right Dr Olsson came back with I had Meth in my body!!! Absolutely not possible 11years of clear UA reports I don't take

I've spent days in my bed sick and in pain. Also my UA was not done by protocol as a matter of FA CT. My insurance never was billed by the company my lab never went too!! Was sent a FAKE

I've met rude, dismissive doctor's- who told me I'd just have to accept the fact that I would be living with a rather high level of pain and there's nothing to be done for it. I've been made to feel like a drug seeker- even though I have always carefully managed my medication. I just quit trying to get better than I was for years.

PMO was AMAZING but this new company is a scam. They'll have you wait hours because they only have 1 doctor on staff that sees 100's of patients. Find another place, there are many many more out there that are way better. They are cheap and you have to skype people on the east coast that are hella rude and disrespectful. They have 6 nurses that walk around doing nothing or sitting at the reception playing games on their phone or computer all day while there are 14 people waiting to go back. It's a terrible place! You will be miserable.|This place saved my life, had a great staff and a beloved counselor Liz, that was particularly helpful and well loved. The worthless CEO of this garbage clinic made a drastic, spontaneous overhaul, fired Liz without a days notice, fired every doctor that had been staffed, turned the front desk employees from joyous welcoming people to seemingly frightened, quiet and PTSD-esque. They abruptly stopped my medication, forced me through withdrawal and played games with scheduling, vague explanations, and underhandedly and secretly blackballed me because a spontaneous cheap instant test yielded positive for benzodiazepenes. This was the only time they hadn't used a lab affirmed UA, and I have had a lab proven false positive for benzos from a faulty instant test. They didn't allow me to contest or lab test my sample which was protocol. The day I was scheduled to finally see a doctor, I met patients with 3 lab confirmed positive UAs who were never abruptly or ever denied their prescription. I also had an appointment with Liz, the favorite individual and group counselor made on Friday. She was fired by Monday. Plenty of patients walked out in anger immediately. I sat through a very long, theatrical wait and submitted a clean test. Eventually a random new employee told me that not one of several doctors was ""comfortable seeing me"". She lied and said it was because they were unsure about my psych meds that their own office had been prescribing for 8 months with Suboxone and was now an issue. They said I was banned even if I received the remaining meds elsewhere. Basically the entire new staff they used to replace the long time staff were much worse and less educated. I was clearly singled out because I was the only patient with a service dog, but they decided that ""we do not accept established or any patient on any medication that isn't Suboxone."" Very sensible. They handed me a useless generic crisis number sheet and booted me. The entire routine and feel of PMC is like a prison based sobriety program devoid of any compassion and was more fear, authority and power based. When I asked the secretary I knew for a year what the hell is going on, she sheepishly pointed to the name of their slimy, wretched CEO. A heartless woman that didn't even talk to patients. This place is based on money and kickbacks, patients welfare is not even second on their priority list. They brought me to a state of hopelessness, sickness, psychic hell and heroin relapse. I wish 1,000 fold of my suffering upon the CEO and hope she burns in hell. I hope the whole operation goes belly up. If you want to escape opiate dependency and feel better about your life, AVOID PMO. I was blessed enough to get through the horrible place they left me in and I'm now with an awesome doctor at NEIGHBORCARE. NEIGHBORCARE'S PROGRAM IS A GENUINELY PATIENTS FIRST PROGRAM. I hope this review keeps people from PMO's recovery gulag. I am going to speak to the ADA about their tyrant CEO and hope they can slap this ""person"" silly in some form. I came to a reservoir, I left a soulless business suite. SAY NO TO PMO!|Idk, how this place got even a.1 star review its terrible . 1st off its very overpriced even with very good private insurance .2nd  nurses and or the secretaries ignore you and Drs give you a 2 minute physical not even resolving anything just giving you.a bottle of meds and sending you away . thx 4 nothing .

He's not only a great doctor but also a great and wonderful person. He's always supported me and shown care in every aspect. As this is a pain clinic, I'm obviously seeing him for chronic pain. I have numerous specialists, and my weeks are filled with appointments. Christian always knows what's going on in those appointments and goes out of his way to ask about them and make notes. I always go in with a bunch of information for him, and at every appointment, he sits and listens, being more empathetic than most of the other doctors I see. He's always 100% there to shed guidance and point me in the right direction when needed. All he cares about is that I'm doing everything in my power to be healthy. He's always willing to listen to suggestions when I feel an adjustment needs to be made on my medications. Anytime I call with any issues relating to a hospital stay or the pharmacy, he has always responded right away and is more than on top of any situation. He works after hours, and even gives responses on weekends. His staff is filled with some of the nicest people I know, and everyone at the clinic advocates for their patients.

The clinic is constantly booked, yet every single person that works there goes out of their way to be friendly, schedule your appointments, and get you everything you need. Even when other patients aren't returning the same positive vibes, they still manage to stay level-headed, professional, and above all, kind and compassionate. I don't know what I would do without these amazing individuals. They have altered my life in such a positive way that I can't imagine going to any other chronic pain clinic. These people deal with so much on a day-to-day basis, and they deserve the compassion and positivity they continually spread.

If I could, I'd give them a 100-star review. If any of the amazing Restore Health staff read this, please know you're doing such a good job and an amazing thing for those who truly suffer from chronic pain. Please keep up the good work; it is paying off for those who deserve it!|If you are someone who is looking for a pain management team, this is the place to go! I have worked with Christian Garrido for the past 3 years, and he is not only a wonderful doctor but a genuine kind person. I have dealt with a lot of different doctors, and no one compares to Christian. He has sat with me well past my appointment time if needed and has helped me through all different stages of my pain. Sometimes, getting a doctor to listen to you is the biggest battle. I feel like he is the first doctor I have ever had that listened to me. I have recommended him to friends, and they also have had great experiences.

I also want to shout out the front staff and the medical assistants. They are friendly and very warm. I appreciate them a great deal.|We have been going here since they were Lynx. We were happy when Galoshopav was there. But even he gave too high of a prescription for a family member. Wound up in the ER. Caught the amount the time after and noticed the messed up medication. Got it fixed. He left. Then another doctor. He left. Then another doctor. She left. Lynx shut down. Became restore. I think we have Ben through three or four doctor's since. Then, there's no understanding. People are in pain and just want their pain to be managed. We liked them at first. I don't know what is going on now. But I am not happy. Bring an advocate for your appointments.|The Dr was super inappropriate made rude comments made me feel super uncomfortable. I would never recommend anybody to go to him. I will be trying to get a hold of corporate as a patient. This man made me feel below him absolutely disgusted by him. Never again will I go back or have my friends go to him!|Show no concern to pain issues. Only compliance to new rules and drug testing  to keep out the drug users. Helped me not one but showed  zero conc e rn about my well being and health. Nearly killed me with new drug tries which  I tend to be allergic  too. Was absolutely  no help to my needs and concerns|Absolutely terrible experience. Their front office staff refused to help me. Then i asked to speak to management and the front office said they WERE management and the owner gave them permission to refuse me care.  All this because my phone is inactive and i couldn't email them documents. Im flabbergasted. No stars.|Christian (Dr. Gerrido) and Dr K. are an amazing team! They have treated me with empathy, compassion and respect. Here, they combine modern medicine with holistic solutions. They listen, in detail, to my issues and concerns and address them head on and immediately. They even take the time to educate you. Most clinics do not have the time to do that, they rush you through or they don't have the resources available for any other treatment options other than medication. I have several debilitating issues that medication does not always help. After going over these issues with Christian,  he referred me to Dr. K. Between the two of them,  I am treated in a balanced manner that has given me so much relief from relentless pain. I have had non steroidal trigger point injections, acupuncture, chiropractic style treatments, acupressure and even medication adjustment that have less side effects than previous medication. If you are truly looking for help and healing, I recommend you to give them an opportunity to show you all of the things they have shown me. Even their staff treat you with respect and kindness.|I feel fortunate that I was referred to Restore Health. My provider's name is Christian and he is very nice and understanding, but what I appreciate the most is how much he is willing to listen to your concerns.  He genuinely cares and not just about your pain...  He shows compassion regarding the full extent of your health.",2025-01-22|2024-09-26|2024-10-02|2024-12-03|2025-02-03|2025-02-27|2024-07-18|2024-07-29,5|5|2|1|1|1|5|4,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",80.75|76.25|60.75,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ__9v7O8YnlQRoTfP06-kKXc,37

I had to fire him and get another doctor. Been stable ever since I left him and his clinic!|As far as I'm concerned anyone giving Dr. Yu a negative review hasn't given him a chance. When I saw him the first time I was wondering if I should see him a second time. I have to drive a few hours to get to Swedish and I wanted to make sure my drive was worth it. Now, having seen him for about 7 years, I'm so glad he's my dr. My pain is manageable and the drive is well worth it.

Since this review I've had a change of heart. Last time I saw Dr. Yu he was on one topic and I was on another topic. We couldn't connect and his impatience drove me away. I now see a different doctor. Dr. Yu is an excellent doctor but he needs to slow down and listen. His patience is limited.|To be clear, I think Dr. Yu deserves 0 stars.

Exhibits a severe lack of empathy; seems to hold himself in higher rank than patients; rushed & terrible communicator; does not prioritize patient wellness but max number of procedures.

I am a PhD professor who teaches medical anthropology. Dr. Yu is a textbook case of someone who should not be in this line of work. And you don't need to be a PhD professor to know why--you just need to be a patient on the receiving end of his bad temper and poor service.

My husband has suffered chronic pain related to his spine. His surgeon recommend a steroid shot, so he went and got one at another hospital. It didn't work because the person administering the shot delivered it in a spot other than what the surgeon had recommended. My husband then had surgery, to no avail. Enter our relationship with Dr. Yu, who was recommended for pain management.

During the first visit, Dr. Yu did not impress. He rushed and did not listen. He made flippant remarks about patients with chronic pain becoming suicidal. He pushed a spinal stimulation chip that he is a fan of, but had no other plan except for another steroid shot. But the shot didn't work, we said. ""That's because the guy who did it was too scared to put it in the right spot--it's risky. But I'm not afraid, and I will put it in the right spot,"" he claimed.

So we decided to try the shot again. When the insurance denied it, Dr. Yu's office failed to appeal until we called them to remind them. During the next weeks, Dr. Yu left my husband in crippling pain with no medication or pain management plan, even though we let him know that my husband could not function. We asked about medicinal marijuana, pain medication, or ANYTHING else that he could suggest. He responded tersely, offering nothing meaningful. He was also shockingly ignorant of my husband's medical history, telling him to up the dosage of a drug that he was already maxing out--clearly he never read the patient's MyChart. We wrote to him asking, point blank, ""What is your plan for pain management as the pain management doctor??"" He reluctantly wrote a prescription for pain killers at an insultingly low dose that has no effect. The result was a patient in so much pain that he could not function in daily life.

Finally, the shot was approved and we went to get it. We were received by Dr. Yu saying, ""OK! Last procedure of the day!!!"" He rushed through some waivers and blurted out that he was going to deliver the shot in THE SAME WRONG SPOT AS THE FIRST GUY DID. Mistakes happen, so it was just a matter of letting him know that the spot we needed was the spot the neurosurgeon had recommended, not the incorrect spot that had been treated previously. His assistant went to inform him.

Dr. Yu did not deal with the confusion well. Or maybe he did not like feeling corrected. Or maybe the hospital overworks him and he can't handle all the stress. Whatever it was, it was ugly.

He began by backpedaling and saying that the previous doctor hadn't done it wrong after all, rather, his technique may have been ineffective, and the shot is likely to work this time even if it didn't last time, etc. It was a lot to digest, didn't always make sense, especially since he was rushing and in a very bad mood. It wasn't just the information we were digesting but the prospect of having the procedure performed by a doctor who was angry and rushed.

Not even two minutes had gone by when Dr. Yu grabbed his coat and said, ""So that's it, you're not getting the shot."" We said, ""No, it's not that; we're just taking a minute to think about it."" His response? ""I don't have time for this! I have to be in the OR in 20 minutes!!!""

Um, OK. We definitely didn't want a 30 minute procedure performed by a guy in a rush to be somewhere in 20 minutes, so we let him go. I feel VERY concerned about the patient in the OR, who was about to be operated on by a man in a rage.

We will never visit Dr. Yu again. And we will be pursuing the matter with higher authorities in Swedish.|Dr Yu is every bit a professional. He is a bit short on words but Ihe has been my specialist for many years and I appreciate his knowledge and skills. I jokingly tell him at appointments he simply can not ever retire!|As you can see dr yu rated very low. I understand why.  He doesn't listen he bullies you into unnecessary procedures and is quite frankly the rudest doctor I've ever met. Zero compassion to arrogant.  Suprised he is still in practice.|Felt like being in a car dealership for Medtronic implant products. It's pretty clear who's paying for his office.

He abruptly canceled my procedure, leaving the room without explanation. Rather than discussing the situation with me, he simply deemed me ""nervous"" and walked away. Subsequently, I received a bill for a procedure that NEVER HAPPENED, and attempts to clarify were met with unresponsiveness from his staff.

Dr. Attaman's lack of professionalism and accountability is concerning. I strongly discourage seeking his services due to the dismissive attitude and questionable billing practices. Consider opting for a more reliable and trustworthy medical professional to save yourself unnecessary trouble.|I am a firefighter paramedic and our benefits directed me towards Dr Attaman's office. His consultation process is simple and fast; you understand the next steps as soon as you finish the initial consult. Scheduling was very easy and accommodating. The office is relaxing and staff is professional and very friendly. Dr Attaman never pushed any surgical agenda and treated what I felt was permanent soft tissue pain within my neck with excellent results. Zero time off of work. Follow up was timely, thorough, and thoughtful. Recently I recognized I injured my knee; he was the first phone call I made. All the fear that comes with the what-ifs when we have these physical jobs and get injured was negated when I went to see Dr Attaman and I would highly HIGHLY recommend anyone, especially IAFF FFs with our benefits, to reach out and take a step to life without that nagging pain you've just put up with, new and old.|Dr. Attaman and his team helped me recover from a lumbar spine injury to my L4/L5/S1. I no longer need to take any pain medication and my back no longer hurts. I had chronic pain for years following the injury, with intense sciatica, low back pain and odd (and often painful) sensations going all the way to my foot.

I followed the requested supplement protocol and received PRP injections after an initial telehealth consult and in person exam. I would and have recommend this office to people struggling with pain management who are looking for long term relief.

It seems many of the reviews on here are people being upset that they don't want to provide sufficient pre-appointment information or secure their appointment with payment. I'm not sure how those folks think a busy doctor's office is supposed to work, but I found all the information asked for to be appropriate considering the type of care I was seeking. Remember that review sites like this are prone to selection bias. Malcontents have a disproportionately loud voice on them.

It looks like there are two entries for this office. Be sure to look at the other one with 150 reviews listed as just Jason Attaman, not Jason G Attaman for more reviews.|I had one appointment that was done virtually due to ongoing back & rib pain. I was initially referred for gentle rib manipulation but during my appointment was told he is no longer doing this due to a personal injury. He then recommended PRP injections, even though he knew my medical history and other diagnosis. After the appointment I was bombarded with many emails regarding the PRP injection appointments and supplements he wanted me to take. I wanted to first run the procedure by my rheumatologist and my pain management doctor given they are who referred me to him. Given the fact that I've been in pain for over a year I wanted to make sure the appointment wouldn't be booked out months so I decided to call and schedule. They require over $1200 for a deposit on this procedure. After my appointment with my pain management doctor he was SHOCKED to find out 1) how much they charge and 2) that PRP was even recommended given my medical diagnosis.

I attempted to call the clinic manager and request a refund given I will NOT EVER be having the PRP injections done as this is not the correct treatment plan for me. However, Dr.Attaman denied the refund. For a doctor to prescribe a treatment plan without ever physically touching my back and ribs and then not be willing to refund over $1200 to an individual is outright unethical. What do you plan on doing with that money?

After several months of back and forth between my original referring doctor and this clinic Dr. Attaman denied the refund of the entire deposit after initially calling me to tell me they would give me 50%.  I will NEVER return to this clinic for treatment and hope no one in pain who is just seeking help is treated this way again.|Dr. Attaman was a good listener, efficient, friendly, and he was able to diagnose my pudendal nerve pain. He carefully listened to my particular concerns, and did his best to guide me through the nerve block shots without undue pain.

Other MDs had been of no help with this particular condition, but he was able to alleviate some of the suffering. Also, he has offered a treatment plan to move forward that is affordable, and I have full confidence in his knowledge of this rare condition. If he did not offer this expertise, I would have continued suffering without a diagnosis. I now feel hopeful I have a treatment plan. It was well worth traveling from out of state for this visit. I would highly recommend his office for pain management.

The office staff was also efficient, friendly, and did a great job!|Dr. Attaman has done an excellent job taking care on my dad and my brother. He is so patient and kind. He strives to take the best care possible of his patients. He gives 100% and there's no one else I would trust more! I highly recommend going to see Dr. Attaman for your pain needs.|I have been seeing Dr. Attaman since early May. He has literally been a life saver to me in treating my conditions. He and his entire staff are warm, caring, knowledgeable and truly want what is best for you. I am so grateful to have found Doctor Attaman.|I paid for an invoice 8 months ago, and continue to get notices sent to me requesting payment.

They don't accept outside referrals. They couldn't be bothered to inform my providers office with this information after receiving a referral from him. I have been waiting for 3 months. In pain. When I called them to see about an intake appointment and was informed of their policy...
I was spoken to as if i should have known. No concern, caring, or offer of apology.|I wish I hadn't gone here. I belive  Dr yu should not be a dr.  He is rude and has no concern for  the people who  have  no choice. On my august  22. Appointment he was 20 minutes late.   The Injection was performed without enough sedation.   When I informed the doctor of the pain that I was feeling I was Told twice no talking and to be quiet.   He seemed to Have no compassion regarding My pain.  I was under the impression that I would be given a local anesthetic before the procedure started to my knowledge, this was not the case.  This was the most horrific thirty minutes of my life.  I don't even think I waited for the mandatory observation.  I immediately walked back to the intake room put on my shirt and left.  I really did not wish to see this doctor again.  However on the third day sends this procedure the pain was really kicking it up.   So I made another appointment with him and it was a complete disaster.   I was chewed out for a message that I put on my chart regarding his behavior toward me.   This doctor then proceeds to gaslate me and humiliate me in every shape and form.   He told me that I didn't have what I had been diagnosed with back in march.  He told me I had something completely different.  He explained then that there was a couple of other injections that could be performed. And when I told him that I couldn't do any more injection unless I was completely sedated. He rolled his eye.  So finally, after twenty minutes of his gaslighting humiliation, I had decided I'd had enough and this appointment was over.  He then proceeds to hand a sheet of paper with quote pain clinics listed.  So this morning August twenty ninth I Called several of several of them.  One the number had been disconnectwo none of them had a voice answering machine.   And three of them would be a five  hour trip from my location, one way. So please if you need any type of injections please please go somewhere else. Update  January  2024   after this  disaster  I decided I'd  would give chiropractor  a try.  This treatment  has  been a blessing.  The chiropractor  told me that when I had my first treatment  my back and shoulders  were  a mess.  Now I have more movement and  less  pain.  Dr yu  was wrong.  My muscles were  so tight.   Dr yu really  should  really suggest    a chiropractor. It's been  nearly  a year  since  this horrific  and painful experience  Ihave tried to put this in the pass. I beg any one let  injections  be the last resort.|I was referred to Swedish Functional Restoration.  Prior to my first appointment, I received a call to schedule an appointment and told the person I was speaking with that I was currently seeing a physical therapist that I really liked and wanted to continue with the physical therapist. The therapist was not with Swedish.  I was told that I could not do this because they wanted all my care at one place.  I was seen by Dr. Wilson Chang and told that this program would include pain management, physical therapy and occupational therapy.  It was two months between the first and second appointments that I had with Dr. Wilson Chang. I never saw anyone for pain, I had two appointments with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a physical therapist.  I met with Dr. Chang on my second appointment and told him that I felt not listened to by the occupational therapist and said that the physical therapist did not have a goal of strengthening my lower back at the same time as working on healing my torn tendons which my previous therapist had and it helped.  Dr. Wilson cut me off and told me the next step was a cortisone shot.  He told me I had ten days to get back to him.  I did not get back to him at all.  The past shots have never helped me.

Swedish Functional Restoration with their policy that my healthcare had to all be done at the same place, Dr. Wilson Chang misrepresenting to me what was going to be offered to me and how it was going to work and my physical therapy goals being changed from what I had with my prior physical therapist, without telling me, let me know that Providence Swedish is not interested in including the patient in their healthcare and is more interested in controlling the progress of your healthcare.|The Seattle pain clinic pain reduction program is how the recommended For those invested in learning about their pain as well as means of reducing it. The Program Is very comprehensive.
Including physical therapy, occupational therapy, pain psychology, and stress management, relaxation methods. Staff members are highly educated, compassionate and very easy to work with. Doctor Chang is excellent as well; making for a comprehensive team.|Well where do I start? I went and seen a doctor there because my primary care doctor told me to and when I got there I seen Dr. Zhang worst decision of my life he told me it's  all in my head and that I need to do yoga and go on walks and runs  as if that's going to help, any gaslighted everything I said about my pain and told me it was on my head and I needed to talk about it because of him I was cut off my pain prescription that I've been on since 2016  because he recommended stuff that we've already done medication's. We've already tried and basically said because he couldn't see my charts that he didn't think I was being seen by a doctor back in 2016 ( old doctor left providence). This place is the worst I've ever seen and I turned him into the board of doctors and into the state because I want him investigated the system I think he is a womanizer and I feel like he is a joke and should have his license removed|Dr. Chang and his team are amazing. I am new to Washington and finding medical care to the extent that I needed was becoming an impossible task. I was finally referred to Swedish hospital (5 hours away from my home) and I am so glad that I was. My initial exam with Dr. Chang was so thorough and everyone in his office was so compassionate. Dr. Chang has followed up on my treatment several times and even spoken with other doctors on my medical team to make sure they all on the same page (when does that ever happen?).  I can't recommend them enough. Thank you Swedish Pain services for everything you are doing for me.|I see Dr. Steven Stanos here at this Swedish clinic. He is very respectful and a wonderful listener. He is very aware of my past and present health records. He researches his information before giving me instructions on what he would like me to do for my chronic pain issues. I would definetely recommend him to  anyone looking for a pain services provider doctor. He also treats me as an equal when dealing with me at my monthly appointments.

I can't even get access to my records including MRI. If you're looking for Dr. Martin, he is with Virginia Mason down in Bonney Lake.|Fantastic medical team! The office staff, medical professionals, and the surgery team were top notch. Dr. Smith handled my broken arm from the ER consultation through the surgery and post operative care. Great care and great results!|Dr. Smith was informative, personable, and a great listener.  She outlined a detailed care plan, with options as my symptoms might progress.  I will definitely recommend her to friends, and continue her as my care provider!|My experience is only relevant to my experience with Dr Susie Kwon. I would avoid her at all cost. I was referred to her by my PCP for chest pain. I went through 6 weeks of PT to get an MRI and she diagnosed me with something Scheuermanns Syndrome which so far has been refuted by 2 other Drs I have seen. She suggested I get trigger point injections which I did not take lightly and took my time to research the risks and ultimately decided I would be ok with trying it as a purely diagnostic tool to determine if trigger point injections in my back made the pain in my chest go away which she stated would be an appropriate diagnostic tool. I asked her at the time of I would need someone to drive me and she stated it was a simple procedure that could be done in the exam room and that she didn't need imaging and would use the bones as guide. When I arrived for my appointment, she came into the room and immediately started accusing me of making requests against her recommendations which made me feel quite confused and no longer prepared for my appointment. I asked her to treat me like an idiot and assume I know nothing because I'm just a patient and not a Dr. She insisted that she didn't need to treat me like that and that I apparently knew it all already. I regurgitated what she stated at our last appointment and she insisted she did not suggest trigger point injections per her notes and had instead suggested I go to a surgery center and get an epidural. I don't know how I would have came up with one treatment over a nother because the words are quite different. In my opinion, she had to refer to her notes because she speed visits her patients so quick that she is unable to keep up with her patients base. She always gave me the impression that she was trying to be in and out as quick as possible. We went back and forth for a bit and she reiterated that she could not and would not perform an epidural in the office which again left me confused because I did not ask for that and it was the first time I was ever hearing of it. To me where she crossed the line was stating that she couldn't do the procedure without paralyzel8ng me and asked me twice in a threatening manner if I wanted her to paralyze me right there in the exam room. It was at this point that I told her I was no longer comfortable being a patient of hers and told her she was an awful Dr that needed to work on her bedside manner. I fully intended to never go back there again. Today I received a certified letter stating they were terminating my care as if this was somehow my fault. To date this is the most bizarre medical experience I have encountered and I honestly wish I could say I was making this up. Please be careful if you find yourself under her care, trust your gut if it doesn't feel right.|I love Dr Donna Smith. She is very warmand puts  you at ease. She gives her full attention to you and your injury. You feel immediately safe, she is here to help you.

At each consultation I presented with very severe neck pain resulting from injuries. Specifically, in 2009 a local Chiropractor manipulated my cervical spine despite my expressed concerns about a history of episodic cervical pain, and in 2015 I sufferred a herniated disc at C4-C5 from an industrial accident caused by a careless co-worker. After each incident I chose conservative treatment though surgery had been recommended. In each instance, Epidural Steroid Injections performed by Dr. David and his team eliminated my use of very strong opioid pain medications within days, and provided for a pain-free existence thereafter -- and it is now 2024! Because of my experiences with Dr. David, I took my mother to see him for hip and lower back pain. I am confident that he will help her like he helped me -- I trust this man with my life and with those I love and care about. Dr. David is the best of the best and our community is very fortunate to have him available for our care.|I've been seeing Dr David for 7 years & he & his team or incredible. Before consulting with him I was always in severe cervical pain. At times my pain was so severe & disabling that I'd end up in the ER. Thru procedures & exercise, Dr David has been able to minimize my pain & maintain a tolerable level. I highly recommend Dr David! He has certainly improved my quality of life.|2023-01-04 I'm here to tell you Dr. David, his fellow Dr. Nixon, the amazing team of nurses, anesthesiologists and other technical folk in his clinic and surgery center are, in my opinion, absolutely phenomenal. I had two days when I had first 3 and then 4 of a total of 7 vertebrae repaired by kyphoplasty. The same day as the first group was completed, I went for a walk with my wife for almost 3 miles. The day of the second set of repairs I walked for close to 2 miles. As of this writing, practically there is essentially no pain whatsoever, and this is not quite 3 weeks out. I had never heard of this surgery and my family's history with back surgery in another state was not good, so I had some trepidation about going in for the corrections. I was given a prescription for some pain medications, but all I needed was acetaminophen (Tylenol). My discomfort was minimal and I expect at the end of my 6 weeks, I will have no problems. He also referred me to Dr. Shuhart for followup with the previously undiagnosed and untreated osteoporosis. Dr. Shuhart is also personable and knowledgeable in his own right. From personal experience, I can say you will be amazed how quickly your pain is over with these folks' intervention. Thanks, people!|Sent home from surgery with half the pain medication as my husband normally takes.  We live out of town and they did not mail the pain script in advance to account for our small town pharmacy only gets the mail 2 days a week. 3 weeks post surgery and my husband is in debilitating pain.  When I called I was told ""it was taken care of"" by the receptionist and never got to speak with a nurse.  Very sad.  I will not be recommending this procedure like I thought.  The trial surgery went better than this.  My heart is very broken.  Sad to see my spouse so disappointed and suffering. Call today and phone just rings until it hangs up. No answering service.|Dr. David, great presence and communication abilities.  Bedside manner is good.  However, my biggest issue with Dr. David has been his inaction and complete lack of compassion.  I ended up in his physiatry practice because of severe back and knee pain after my ulcerative colitis came back with a vengeance after 13 years in remission.  I've gotten one epidural in 3 and a half months with him that provided 2 and a half weeks of mediocre relief.  Nothing else.  I would say that this is not successful, nor acceptable treatment.  If it was another disease or problem being treated, I doubt it would be handled with this level of unempathetic apathy.|Dr. David is very poor at communicating what your problem is, the path to solving the problem and  how he intends to help you. His attitude in the surgery table is flippant and uncaring. Mine was not  a success but his disrespectful attitude is what I will remember most.|My sister has suffered for years, going from doctor to doctor. She met Dr. David and her problems are gone.

Not only was I shaken up physically but also mentally as well. Dr. Walia and his staff have been an integral part in my healing process, making every appointment easy, fast, and restorative. They set me up with a treatment plan that was thorough but also flexible with my work schedule. Any time I needed to change times or make date changes, the staff at the front were more than accommodating. I was shocked by how thorough they were with taking baseline performance metrics and updating those throughout my treatment so I can see and feel real changes throughout the way. If you are ever experiencing pain, I highly highly recommend Dr. Walia and team. They will take care of you and get you back to feeling normal again, which I didn't think was possible. Thanks Dr. Walia!!!|Dr. Walia and team were great. Not only did they get me back to tip-top shape after my accident but they also taught me how to take better care of my back. They definitely live up to their accolades.|Been coming to Dr. Walia's office for 2 years now, can say that they offer wonderful care to their patients! Initially I was seeing Dr. Fairbrook and now have switched to a couple other providers. It is a consistent office, with understanding staff members that will help you with scheduling. Highly recommend!|Dr. Walia offers great care! I was in a lot of pain specifically in my knees, shoulders, and neck. Within a few visits, I was able to start getting through my days with minimal to no pin. He was really helpful and understanding creating a care plan and we've been on track since!|Its been a great chiropractic journey with Dr. Walia over a period of just 2 - 3 months. With a noticeable improvement in my back health and overall posture I have also observed a positive change from a mental health perspective.
Look no further if you appreciate a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere where you go for adjustments!|Dr. Walia and Dr. Fairbrook are both amazing!  I have never responded well to chiropractic treatment in the past but they use a super gentle approach and it works magic every time!  They are great at fitting people in on a shorter notice if needed.  Highly recommend!|I limped into Dr. Walia's office 3 weeks ago, and immediately after a 10 minute session I was able to walk almost completely pain-free. Over the course of the last week, he's been carefully monitoring my progress as I ramp up my workouts again, and I couldn't be happier with his work. Would highly recommend Dr. Walia to anyone who's experiencing chronic back pain or even just for a regular checkup on back health!|I have had several bad experiences with chiropractors in the past. They just grab, twist and crack, and it feels better at first, but inevitably they do something to make things worse. I decided to give it one last shot with Dr. Walia. That was over ten years ago. I'll never go to anyone else. He actually looks for and solves problems with focused treatment. No twisting and cracking. I was in a lot of pain a few weeks ago, and saw unbelievable improvement in just one visit.

They are wonderful and I feel like a new person after only 2 months of treatments! I can't recommend them enough!|I know doctor Keezer as a patient for about 20 years and followed him when he opened his practice in Everett. I'm very happy with his treatments, particularly after a car accident. Would highly recommend him to any new patients.|I wasn't even going to write one of these because the practice wasn't even worth it. The ""Dr"" didn't know how to work the X-ray, ""couldn't remember what to set it at"" I heard him say after 5 min of me sitting with small tanning glasses on my nose to ""protect"" my eyes as he had the machine 2 inches from my face. He kept readjusting and moving around the room all the while I'm still sitting patiently trying to figure out why he wasn't prepared for an appointment. Well, after the 5 ish min I said I got to get up and I got to go. He tried blocking the door and I said nope I'm going out. He was very hesitant about me leaving the room that was upstairs in someone's house. Don't let the pictures on the website fool you,someone converted their home into a ""chiropractors office"" with an X-ray machine upstairs in narrow hallways.
I made my way outside and decided never to return. Well the reason I'm writing this review is due to my bill that I just received in the mail. They billed my insurance $185 and want to charge me now for $50. For what you ask, filling out paperwork. I called and asked why I was being charged and the lady said I will definitely take that off your balance. She then went in to how the process works, which I've already told her I knew I don't need an explanation. The ""Dr"" was ignorant, and had no idea what he was doing. Apparently I was yelling at her even though my whole family was right there listening to me and I only got frustrated with her when she told me she's NOT going to take it off the balance because of how I'm ""yelling"" at her. She said she would NOW have to send it to the ""Dr"" to see if we can waive it due to how I'm speaking. I explained that she just said she was going to take it off, and now she's not because of how she assumed I was talking to her? She said yes. I told her to take it off or I'm going to get a lawyer, she said go ahead. Already reported to the BBB.|Dr. Keezer is incredibly helpful with my incredibly pitiful body (chronic pain) and has made it possible for me to continue my job even on my worst days!
They are amazing.
Kristine is a wonderful Office Manager as well. Always attentive and a pleasure to speak with.|Dr Keezer is wonderful. He was the first one on the scene when my son got hit by a car in front of his business and he stayed with him until he was loaded into the ambulance. He and his office assistant, Kathy, then reached out to me to make sure my son was ok and he offered to do a free exam on him. He's been his chiropractor for 8 months now and I just set up service for myself. He's a great chiropractor. I definitely recommend him.|Dr. Keezer is incredible. I was in a pretty severe car accident in July and have been seeing him since. He's very professional, thorough and kind. Every time I come in I feel like I'm getting the best treatment possible. The entire staff here is great. I plan on continuing to come here for adjustments and massage even after I am fully recovered from my accident.|I started going to Back Pain Relief Center to see Dr. Keezer back in 2018 after years of playing sports and constantly being in pain. Within the first few weeks of undergoing chiropractic care, I began to feel extremely well. My migraines were gone, my neck began to feel better and I finally got my sleep back.

I just moved here from Tampa where I saw a wonderful pain management team.
Someone warned me about this place and I should have listened. Although everyone was friendly, especially the front desk and the nurse, the Dr didn't even mention all my back problems. Just addressed the knee issue. I've been on pain medication for a while for spinal stenosis, 2 bulging discs, a spinal cord stimulator, and sciatica. I can't even sit in a chair properly due to back pain!  The Dr told me they only give pain meds to cancer patients. So then why not call it that then? Call it the cancer center. Not pain management! I was told to go swimming for rehab. Are you kidding?? He didn't even address the reason I have such bad pain in my legs at night either. And I can't even get the injection for my knee until the end of the month! Upon leaving he hands me a paper about how NOT to just stop taking your pain medication and how you should taper off.  But yet doesn't tell me how to do that or give me a script for a lower dosage. I'm not surprised AT ALL why there is such an opiate crisis here!! And why people seek out 'other' options. This is a joke! There has to be a better way of treating people here!|Only wanted to talk about my lower back touched one spot told me it was my muscles ignoring the crate that day it is not just my muscles. Gives me a note for physical therapy and tells me to come back in 3 months waste of time and money|I've debated on reviewing this place for a long time now. I guess I keep hoping things will get better. However, this office has shown me that better is not an option. First off everyone should be made aware that you will not see a doctor at each visit. You will see the doctor for your first appointment and for any injections or procedures. Other than that, you see a nurse practitioner. Now i genuinely believe that these NP's have had the new opiate prescribing guidelines drilled into their head so much that they don't know how to deal with patients who do not take them.

So, what do they do? They rely on patient ignorance while withholding and refusing and all treatments.
I have had them tell me (attitude indluded)
""Your at your maximum dose"" (without me even asking for an increase) or my personal favorite,
""there isn't anything else we can give you!""
This last one is usually followed by the doctor coming in and contradicting every one of the nurses claims.

Further proof of this was presented to me two weeks ago. A few months ago I started seeing a new NP who was awesome! She actually took great care of me. She listened to me and remembered everything I told her. She was willing to go down every avenue to find the root cause of my problem. She never once made false promises .
I just found out she no longer employed at their facility...

During my seeing her, she told me we could go up on my lidocaine patches if need be. At the time i did not need it. I've since endured a few surgeries and realized i could really use an extra lidocaine patch. I contacted my new PA and what does she say?
""I'm sorry, one patch is the maximum dose"".

So i told her what the doctor told me in the hospital. ""Actually 3 is the maximum dose"".

So i get a message back (attitude included) ""I've sent a new prescription for 3 patches to your pharmacy""

That was not my intention but it was just further proof that they count on patient ignorance so they do not have to provide treatment.
Why they do this to those of us who do not use opiates is beyond me but given the fact that the waiting room always seems to be full of elderly patients who look so pained, I'm sure this treatment is harming more people than just me.

Edit: since writing this email my doctor has been switched 2 more times. The first time was as all the others had been. The second time the NP was awesome and again, wanted to get to the root cause so he could properly treat me. That was for about six months which is oddly similar to the last NP who wanted to do more than deny treatment. Now I've been told he's gone too and once again i've been switched to someone else.|I have wasted 3 months of my life at this clinic. I have been experiencing neck and upper back pain for the last 9 months. At the 6 month mark, I had my first visit. I was told the doctor, chiropractor, and movement therapist would work together to best help me recover. That was not true at all. The movement therapist gave me exercises to do and 2 weeks later the chiropractor told me to stop doing them. After waiting almost a month, I had trigger point injections in my left trap & left upper back region. I did not feel any relief. Two weeks later I had my follow up with the doctors PA and I asked for more injections. She refused that request & told me to go to talk therapy to help cope with the pain or go to another clinic. She said she would talk to the doctor about my treatment plan moving forward. 2 weeks passed and I heard nothing back. I sent a message on MyChart and did not receive any response until a week and a half later. He told me the same thing his PA had said. After 6 rounds of acupuncture, the chiropractor recommended injections in my neck. I told him the doctor refused to do them and the chiropractor said he didn't have contact with the doctor and his hands were tied. Once again I reached out to the doctor to ask for this treatment. His reply was to have another follow up in 2 weeks to discuss the possibility of more injections. I felt like they were just prolonging the process to make me come in for more visits. At this point I was fed up and decided to try another clinic. After my first visit at the new clinic the doctor said I needed multiple sessions of injections in my neck, both traps, and upper back, along with physical therapy. Do not make the same mistake and I did and believe this Pain Clinic has your best interest!!|I have seen Dr. Carpenter a total of 4 times and have yet to receive any pain relief of any kind.  The administrative staff and nurses are absolutely wonderful and incredibly helpful. After my first appointment, she tried to transfer me to another doctor, and the only reason she agreed to see me again is because I wrote a strongly worded message about being shuffled around to another doctor.  As with other doctors I have dealt with at WVU, the notes put in my file are only partially true.  The only action Dr. Carpenter would take is to give me a diagnostic nerve block in my back, even though I've had 4 of them so far.  I have major, untreated anxiety and mental illness which was not taken into consideration at all.  Nerve blocks are one of the most painful things I've ever gone through, they actually make my back pain worse, to the point where I can't walk for a day or two after.  The first block I was scheduled for, was cancelled when I got there due to reasons I was not informed about ahead of time, after I drove an hour each way.  After only getting 2 hours of sleep, fasting, and having to drive an hour each way, my anxiety was sky high for the second procedure.  At the beginning of the procedure, I informed staff that I was having a bad time and was completely disregarded.  She then got quite upset when I had a neurodivergent meltdown due to pain, fear, and anxiety and callwd her a cunt due to her hateful behavior.|Do not visit this clinic. My husband was refered here by another clinic that was wonderful because they were unable to do injections and this office could and it was closer to us as we live in PA but he got hurt in WV. He came here the first time and was told to wait 6 weeks and do physical therapy if he could. And then we came back to get his full release to work since the pain was managable and he couldn't afford anymore time off and after calling first to make sure they could do it. We drove the hr+ here only for the doctor to say she wouldn't sign the release he needed to go back to the first clinic for that. So he had 2 visits here and they did absolutely nothing.  But recommend more appointments. They're just looking to charge you for appoinments but not actually trying to help. They seriosuly couldn't tell us over the phone he needed to go back to the first clinic. But instead had us drive over and hour to get here and pay for an appointment  to be seen for 2 minutes where they did nothing but tell him to go back to the first place because she won't lift his restrictions which is what he asked if they could do over the phone before we drove here. Why did we have to pay for an appointment for that? They don't want to help anyone and they just want money from as many appointments as they can book!|I went in for a epidural in my lower back. But, evidently is was above Kelsey Bauer's skill level.  After three very painful attempts, she said, ""if you want I can try again."" I told her no, she should be able to do her job on the first attempt. After I declined to let her continue to inflict pain on me, they gave me no advice on what I should do next. Instead, they rushed me out like they were trying to hide the evidence of their incompetence's. All they've done so far is inflict more pain then they have relieved. On top of that Kelsey Bauer lied on the mychart results and said she only attempted the injection two times.  She must of forgot I was there also and that I can count.  She tried a minimum of three times, more likely four.  Either way don't let them do anything to you!!

****Update!!!! on my follow up appointment!

Well it went just like I thought it would! They were more worried about protecting their reputation then helping me with my pain. They called me unprofessional for pointing out that one of their doctors couldn't do what they were supposed to do. Then they started throwing around all the ""gas light"" phrases about me. They said I cursed at the doctor during my procedure. I did say $h*t, but it was not not directed at anyone.  I said it because she was inflicting a great deal of pain on me. Again, they had a lot of excuses, and how I was wrong, but no apology, they blamed me for their failure. Draw your own conclusions.|Our healthcare system is BROKEN and the providers that judge and talk condescending to the patients is inappropriate. I left the clinic crying in pain.

Had back surgery in december from cleveland clinic. Had horrible pain for months. Had signed referrals from cleveland clinics best brain surgeon and spine surgeon for pain management here so i didnt have to drive to cleveland for every appointment. Came here twice and was only offered steroid epidurals which have never worked at all. Complete waste of my time and money. Will only be using drs from cleveland from now on|I have only had the best treatment anybody could asked for.  The entire staff is fabulous, very friendly, very caring & truly care about there patients.  Dr Lee is a god send.  She is the best dr I have ever come across.  She cares & takes fabulous care of her patients..  My daughter is special needs & Dr Lee treats her with respect & helps her with all her needs.  I love , love, love this place.  I would recommend this place to all.|In my opinion Dr. Le is the most qualified and outstanding pain management physician in the tri-state area. Dr. Le listens to your issues and comes up with a treatment plan to manage your pain and get you back to living a happy life. One thing I love about her is that she does not want to hand out addictive pain meds and push you out the door. She uses procedures to treat your concerns and then will use the safest medication to supplement the procedures if needed. This is a legitimate pain management facility unlike some of the others I have been to in the past. I recommend Dr. Le to everyone in need of pain relief and will continue to do so.|Doc and her staff are all amazing! Her PA, Allison, is also fabulous! I have been treated very well from everyone! The nurses who take care of everything are great too! Always on top of things. I rarely wait for anything! I trust them all!|I have been seeing Dr Le for years she is compassionate and her staff in West Virginia is amazing. She is the only Dr that I trust and is always willing to take the time to listen to me. Would never see another pain management doctor. Dr Le and her staff are 5 stars.|Dr. Lee is NOT a pain management doctor, sent my father here who has multiple well documented physical problems that cause him a tremendous deal of pain on a daily basis. She was unprepared, unprofessional and very rude in regard to his conditions. My father's previous pain management doctor has closed and I have been working with him to find another one to properly manage his pain. Doctor Lee seems to believe that pain medication is NOT a part of running a pain management office. You will more than likely NOT get any help from this woman. My father was told he was to young to be on medication all though he is over 60 years of age.  She also did not appear to look at any of his records before walking into the room to speak with him. She also over charged for the visit in regards to his copay.|I have been coming here for a few months now, from Dr. Balgos office. My records clearly state all my conditions and she has yet to even look at them. She just keeps weaning me more and more off of my medications. Guess quality of life doesn't matter much to her. It's less than a 5 min visit that's very rushed. There is Zero time taken. And I'm guessing since I care from Balgo who my husband was a patient of, me previous the veterans affairs hospital which I wanted to get away from I was already labeled before walking in the damn door. It's really really sad that these doctors could not careless. So much for the Oath they have taken.. my husband refused the pain pump so she took him off his medication all together. Well with his job he can't have that or the time off. So guess screw him too! When people start killing themselves she will be investigated!|Have been seeing. Dr Le for approximately 6 years.

I put up with her last year, she yelled at me on phone, she has hung up on me and when ask about them getting my medical records, she plainly told.me that's not her dept. I have spoken with other patients there and they to have a bad opinion of her and her mouth. Needless to say I left. I'll go somewhere else. Ashley you have no experience with people. You are rude, you lie.  Period|Absolutely awful. They forgot to schedule my mom's surgery. They forgot to run her insurance. They forgot to schedule her follow up after surgery. They forgot to schedule to get her staples removed. I've had to call do everything myself. The people who work here should be ashamed.|The staff is excellent !! They make you feel comfortable and relaxed!! Dr. Francis Saldanha and  Karla Downey FNP talk to you , treat you as a patient should be treated . Listen to what problems your having.

This is by far the worst treatment I've received at a medical facility. They have a patient portal set up with message but they don't respond.

Do they not care that people are in chronic pain and need help. Despicable!!|Dr. Saldanha is great. His staff is horrible. After cleaning 2' of snow from my car, I get there and they were closed without calling me to let me know.  Now I get a $225 bill two months after my appointment and have had two more appointments, which will be another $225 each. We were not informed that this was treated as outpatient surgery and therefore have a higher copay. I'd gone for simple cortisone shots. Now we owe $675 in 2 months on a fixed income and the smart alec administrator says they'll send it to collections if we make small payments.|He has taken care of my pain management for almost three years his staff is amazing and everyone is so caring.

I lost my appointment, my friend that took off work to drive me is out, & I'm still in pain all because this hateful receptionist wants to be responded to as God.

Staff, you are awesome. Great job, thank you.|I recently had an appointment with a pain specialist, Mr. Tracey Sherman, PA-C, and I regret to say that it was a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience. As someone who has been struggling with chronic pain, I understand the importance of effective communication and empathy in healthcare, but unfortunately, Mr. Sherman fell short in this regard.

From the moment I entered the clinic, it was evident that Mr. Sherman was more interested in rushing through the appointment than in genuinely listening to my concerns. His demeanor seemed detached and distracted, and it was clear that my pain and discomfort were not his priority.

Throughout the appointment, I attempted to explain the nuances of my pain, its impact on my daily life, and the treatments I had previously tried. However, Mr. Sherman continuously interrupted me, cutting me off mid-sentence and redirecting the conversation to what seemed like a predetermined treatment plan. This lack of active listening made me feel dismissed and undervalued as a patient.

What was most distressing about this experience was that Mr. Sherman's inability to listen resulted in a treatment plan that did not address my specific needs. He seemed more interested in pushing his preferred approach rather than tailoring a solution that considered my unique circumstances.

Chronic pain is a complex and deeply personal experience, and a successful pain specialist must be willing to engage in a meaningful dialogue with their patients to understand the full scope of their condition. Mr. Sherman's lack of attentiveness left me feeling unheard and left me without the relief I had hoped to find.

I left the appointment disheartened, frustrated, and concerned about my ongoing pain management. A strong doctor-patient relationship built on open communication is vital when dealing with chronic pain, and it is disheartening when a medical professional fails to meet this expectation. I sincerely hope that Mr. Sherman can work on his listening skills and consider the unique needs of his patients in the future to provide more effective and empathetic care.|Wonderful, compassionate, caring facility.

She loved him but had trouble with the travel (3hrs) to see him so changed to Morgantown in 2018. Well that was a big mistake. She has a spinal stimulator, pain pump and very complicated history from sarcoma, nerve damage and a hemipelvectomy. Fortunately she went back yesterday to Dr. Deer and was referred to a Neurosurgeon in Durham. I cannot thank him enough for his kind treatment of my parents and his glimmer of hope to find something to help her pain once and for all. AND not only did he offer to speak personally to  the neurosurgeon about her case but they already contacted the NC office and NC called to schedule a consult. Blows my mind with gratitude. I could cry. When someone you love is suffering and you feel powerless to find a solution and a doctor listens to their story, has compassion and tries to help find a solution it's a beautiful thing!! Thank you many times over Dr. Deer and his whole office team.|Saw Dr. Deer years ago (either Spring 2002 or 2003) when I was in excruciating pain and no one could determine the cause or how to help. I am know for being VERY precise and detail oriented. I had even taken a written copy of when my pain began, type of pain, severity of pain, as well as the limitations that resulted from it (I was already using a cane to walk). I asked if he wanted to keep the copy of my history because I had more copies at home, however, he declined my offer. He did, however, give me an injection which helped me finish the school year but when I went back 6 weeks later he told me there was nothing else he could do to help me. Even when I told him the injection had made the pain at least bearable he refused to give me another one, nor did he refer me to any other specialist. Before I left I requested a copy of my records. When I read the entire report TWICE I called his office and told the receptionist it was urgent that I speak with Dr. Deer. He did return my call later that day and I informed him that I was confused and upset because his report was completely incorrect. I went over point by point what I had told him during initial appointment and that I wanted his report redone to state the actual information I had given him. He bluntly told me that he records every intake interview (and I did recall he had activated a recording device) and that his report reflected what I had told him. I again told him the report was NOT correct and I wanted it redone to state what I had actually told him and informed him that I still had the written statement I had brought with me for the initial appointment and had offered to leave with him. At that time Dr. Deer stated that his report was an official document and could not be changed, nor did he give me a reason why it could not be changed. However, he did say that I was welcome to bring in my written version and it would be stapled to the back of his report. I found Dr. Deer to have a cavalier attitude concerning this discrepancy, as well as no concern about my continued pain as he did not offer to refer me to any other pain management doctor or any other type of specialist, basically leaving me to deal with the pain on my own. I was referred to Dr. Deer by my PCP at the time, however, I am unable to verify or denounce his skill as a pain management specialist because all he did was give my one injection then refused to continue treating me or give me a referral to any other specialist when I returned in six weeks for my follow up appointment. I will add that since Dr. Deer is still a practicing pain management specialist twenty two years after my unfortunate experience with him he must be helping some patients who are suffering from pain.|I've been a patient for more than a decade and I have had nothing but wonderful experiences.

We waited over 2 hours to be seen then we hear him ask the nurse ""what am i supposed to do"" as she was giving report on my daughter. He then enters the room and rudely asks us ""why am I here"".

Even if he couldn't help her he could have at least been kind. As I tell my patients, never pay someone to be rude to you.

Dr Tune is easy to talk to. Very knowledgeable, and cares about his patients.|Dr Tune, PA Brandy and the staff are excellent here.
They take the time to hear all your concerns and questions, then explain and answer them completely. Working together to build a plan to help with your pain.
Dr Tune is very thorough in testing, xrays, CT or MRI to fully and completely diagnose your problem. Finding the cause and taking the actions needed to fix it. He is Not someone who throws pain medication at you and doesn't look for the cause of your discomfort. He genuinely cares and wants to help his patients be able to live as much of a normal life as possible. I am someone who does Not want more medication, I want to find the issue and fix it. And Dr Tune does just that. Everyone at the office is kind and professional.
The only thing negative I can say has nothing to do with Dr Tune but with WVU Medicine Not giving him access to the anesthesiologist and radiologist he needs to get procedures done in a timely manner. Waiting 3-4 months to get procedures done because of staffing issues due to the hospital is not acceptable when you are living with severe pain.|Never in my life have I felt disrespected or  horrible about myself  due to a doctor until today,   Dr. Tune is  ignorant and in my opinion the whole office is rude honestly if I could I would give him 0 stars|I am putting a very low review , because I have a pinched nerve in my lower left back ( which he knows from the MRI )  He gave me 1 shot which lasted approximately 1 month .He is rude and  condescending Dr. -It will take a month or longer to get into see him , and don't ask for pain medicine he will not give to you . He will let you be in sever pain and does not care period . He thinks everyone is ""feen"". If he would look at a patients chart "" as mine "" he would see  that I personally have not even been to the ER since 2014. I also do not drink and ou take otc medicine.   He would rather you take a ton of Ibuprofen to kill your liver . Dr. Tune simply DOES NOT care about his patients . I feel he cares more about the insurance money , rather then the patient them self. I have used a heating pad, a Tens unit, a acupuncture mat, a massage gun a roller ,and a pool noodle folded and still in pain . My opinion for anyone who is in pain ,stay away from Dr.Tune and find a Dr.  Who really cares about the patient and not himself.|My husband and I both go to Dr Tune. We have found him to be an excellent doctor and are very pleased with him. He's very knowledgeable, friendly and courteous. His office staff is excellent as well.|Staff is rude.When I was ready 2 check out the lady was on phone looked at nurse & said very rude that she would have 2 take care of it. The nurse very bad bed side manners dr doesn't listen 2 ur complaints doesn't have good bedside manners. I don't recommend them at all.|I first saw Dr. Tune back in 2013 or 2014, not sure which.  At the time, I'd been experiencing mid to moderate back pain for several years.  I stressed in my appointment that my pain was NOT in my spine, but rather in the lower back muscles away from my spine.

Dr. Tune commenced (and rightfully so, in my opinion) a round of diagnostic facet block injections for me.  It was important to rule in or out arthritic causes of my pain.  But the injections didn't stop my pain; instead, having needles forced in to my muscles was in itself horribly painful (I remember vividly lying on that table with a needle in my back muscles and wailing and sobbing with pain).  There's a reason for these tests, and that's to see if your pain is coming from your spine.  If it is, then good for you, because Dr. Tune et alhave a surgical answer for that.

BUT, if your pain does NOT have a clear, operable source, prepare to be written off, shunned, and discarded.  I've yet to hear from a chronic pain patient who was helped by Dr. Tune.  While his badge might say ""Pain Relief"", the truth is that he c@n only provide pain relief IF your cause of pain is an easily identifiable entrapment or the like.

Dr. Tune WILL NOT treat you for chronic pain that has no known cause and isn't treatable by shots or the like.  And (at least from my experience), he will NOT prescribe pain medication.  So, you should see Dr. Tune IF:  your pain is not chronic; you have free time to undergo multiple diagnostic shots; and if you think that diagnostic facet block injections will help you find the source of your pain (I recommend these, without doubt, and recommend Dr. Tune for these...they're important and frankly, required for any long-term pain patient.)

My biggest complaint of Dr. Tune (and, in my world, is s huge and non-negotiable complaint) is his choice to not prescribe ANY opioid painkillers.  At least, that's what I was told.  Even a layman can tell you that if you have a patient eith chronic pain, and (AND THIS IS HUGE) that patient seemingly suffers du to their pain, IF you are a properly certified doctor, you offer pain relief for that person. What you don't do is hide behind laws that specifically do NOT exclude you as a prescriber, and you pony up and fill the scripts you're given.

Okay, I'm tired,  of fightIng, of pronouncing my case. I hope you gain from it.|Long wait time in waiting room(55 minutes). Long wait time after taken back to private room(30 minutes and he was sitting around the corner working on paperwork and didn't not apologize for the wait)

When he was finished, he shut the door without any instruction. I didn't need to get dressed or do anything so I was confused. Finally I opened the door and he peeked around the corner and told me to go schedule.
Will see how he carries out his typical protocol and review again later.
Personally, glad I don't have to get anything major done such as surgery at this point.

My lower back pain began around May after working a 12 hour shift as an aid. At first, I thought I had just pulled a muscle, but that my wasn't the case. Since then, I had a constant burning and stabbing in my back. I couldn't walk, couldn't stand, couldn't sit for long periods of time. I even struggled to put on SOCKS. I am young, and I need my back for a lot of things. After going to another chiropractor that did NOTHING for my back, I went here. I was terrified because I had never been somewhere that would actually crack my back, but I was willing to try anything to get rid of this pain. Dr. Dorey was fantastic. He explained everything to me, and he told me that I would be controlling my plan of care. He didn't expect me to need a lot of sessions to get better. I have done two sessions so far. After the first one, I felt like a new person. I was walking normally again, I could pick things up off the ground. I was doing everything that I had been doing before without pain. Today was my second session (exactly a week after my first), and the only pain that I have is a little aching in the morning that goes away as I get my day started. This place is incredible, and everyone there is very professional and kind. I highly recommend.|Dr. Dorey is the best! Excellently equipped and CLEAN facility - they always get me in in a timely fashion. X-ray capabilities, and now offering medical massage!|I've been going to see Dr. Dorey for several years now, and I will not go anywhere else! I ride horses and have had lower back problems since I was 16, and for several years I worried I would have to give up what I loved. Every time I would ride or do anything even remotely strenuous, my back would punish me for days afterwards. And if I continued to push myself, it could be months of intense pain and limited activity before I could resume my normal activities. Since I started going to Spineworks, I've felt like I can live my life again. I am back to riding my horses, cleaning stalls, playing with my dogs, doing housework, and not being worried about whether or not I'll be able to function for the next 6 months. Dr. Dorey always gets me in pretty quickly when I'm having a flare up, and I always leave feeling significant improvement. I'm also able to be seen as little or as often as I want, and he never makes me feel pressured about my decisions; he will give me his advice and then let me decide. This is something I know a lot of places aren't good at, and I really appreciate his approach to this. Sometimes I only need to see him once or twice a year, and sometimes I see him weekly or twice a week for a period of time; this mostly depends on my activity level and what trouble I'm getting myself into lol. I briefly worked for Advantage Health and Wellness in Morgantown as well, and even while working there, I still went to Dr. Dorey for my care. He has such a different approach than other places I've seen, and I will never go anywhere else as long as he's still in business. I truly believe he cares for his patients, and yes he runs a business and needs to make a profit, but he isn't out to drain your pocketbook. Dr. Dorey also has impeccable bedside manner, and even my friend who has had bad experiences with multiple doctors/specialists in the past feels very comfortable going to see him. So if you're reading this, I'll tell you, and I'll continue to tell everyone I talk to in person, go see Dr. Dorey if you need chiropractic care! :)|HANDS DOWN THE BEST!!! All the reviews I read before going were spot on and it's the service the verbal walk thru with everything he did and everything he didn't recommend if you don't go you're missing out 28 yrs of pain and today I am 210% pain free|From the friendly greeting by Kat when you walk in, to the warm welcome by Dr. Dorey, Spineworks instantly makes you feel welcome and comfortable.

The offices are clean and well maintained, and it is clear the equipment is well kept and up to date.

Dr. Dorey takes the time to explain the 'why' behind the injury and explains the treatment in such a way which educates you, without ever making you feel dim-witted.

The skill and precision with which he operates has you feeling better more quickly than you would anticipate.
His technique is quick and effective, yet you never feel rushed, and it is EVIDENT that he cares about getting the problem(s) resolved as quickly as possible.

I have never in my life experienced a specialist who is so kind and personable (and I've seen my fair share). I most sincerely could not recommend ANY other office with such conviction. If you're looking for a quality Chiropractor, you need look no further. I would rate 10 stars if I could!|You won't find a friendlier doctor around Morgantown. Dr. Dorey asks you very specific questions to localize the problem you're having|I hesitate to write a review, because some may say it's too good to be a true review. Nope. He's that good. From Kat, (Cat?) Up front, to the few other crew he has to help, I have nothing but great things to say. Friendly and kind, and at the same time, very professional. Clean and quiet atmosphere, with a very low stress vibe.

Dr. Dorey is nothing short of a magician.  I spent months at another place that couldn't care less about my health, just about billing. Dr Dorey has changed my ability to walk and work in less than 3 weeks, when others failed for 4 months.|Went in for lower back pain. Dr. Dorey is SUPER nice, personable and makes you feel comfortable from the beginning throughout the entire appointment. He is there to help and wants to make his patients comfortable and feel better by the end of every appointment. He explains everything in detail an what he is going to do every time to make you feel better. Go see him ASAP for back pain.

My message request October 7th was unanswered. Today, October 30th, my brother will be getting the treatment he needs from another facility who got the prior authorization in 3 weeks.

He keeps you calm, he is outgoing and funny. Most importantly he gives the best epidurals hands down. I have received them in my neck and back and always left the procedure feeling relief.  He has changed my life and I am so grateful.|Dr. Dino is the best doctor around. He takes great of me and really cares about his patients. I have been coming to him for many years.|I came in very nervous(I hate needles) but the nurses and Dr Dino were so nice and comforting. They explained everything they were going to do and did what they said. After sedation everything was fine and I was able to relax and have my procedure done.

I think that is great as I'm usually nervous. I would definitely recommend coming here for all your back problems!|They always make me feel comfortable and the vibe is always friendly. Everyone is laid back but still professional. I just love Dr Dino! ***edited - yes, I meant to type comfortable!|I recently had a procedure done on my lower back with Dr. Dino and I am thrilled with the experience. From start to finish, the care provided was exceptional. Dr. Dino demonstrated remarkable expertise and made sure I felt comfortable and well-informed throughout the process.

The support staff--Michelle, Dionne, Janet, Kelly, Becky, and Romie--were all outstanding. They were professional, compassionate, and attentive, ensuring that every aspect of my visit went smoothly. Their collective dedication made what could have been a stressful experience remarkably positive. I highly recommend Dr. Dino and his incredible team for their outstanding care and professionalism.|This place and Dr. Dino and his staff were so amazing. He sat with me before hand and talked in depth about everything and made me feel real comfortable. I was BERY nervous and high anxiety for the epidural steroid injection so much so I wanted to be completely sedated. Coming in I learned it wasn't really that more like twilight but I would be breathing on my own. I didn't even remember anything other they taking my glasses off and I woke up in my recovery room. For anyone experiencing high anxiety, please don't. They were all amazing at every step of the way. Literally everyone. Briana Leyba|I have been a patient of this practice for about 8 months. I had a spinal fusion last week leaving me with a significant amount of pain. On Friday, the NP prescribed me a pain medication that was not in stock at the pharmacy she sent it to. I called around and found this medication was in stock at a different pharmacy about 20-25 min away. I called the office back but it was a little after 430p and no one was available. This practice does not have a provider on call after hours so I had to wait until Monday to speak to someone. I called on Monday morning and left a message on the nurse line for the NP to send the prescription to the pharmacy where it was in stock. Rarely does anyone answer on the nurse line so you need to leave a message most times. The NP sent the prescription to the pharmacy but I found out it was not covered by my insurance and will cost me $487.00. I called the office back, left a message and got a call back from the nurse. Monday afternoon the nurse told me she would have to do a ""prior authorization"" to try to get this prescription covered by my insurance. Tuesday nothing was done. Wednesday was Christmas. Today, being Thursday,  I called the nurse line at 0815 and left a message. I got a call back from the nurse around 1p telling me the NP left at 12p so she will have her sign the prior authorization tomorrow. Why wasn't this done on Monday? Or Tuesday? Or this morning? It's been almost a week and nothing has been done regarding my pain. I am so unhappy with this situation. The provider should be addressing my pain in the meantime while waiting for this ""prior authorization"" but she has not. I've been in a significant amount of pain since this surgery and after being discharged from the hospital last week and what I was taking prior to surgery has not been effective. I don't know what to do. The pain in my lower back and upper legs when moving can be excruciating. At this point, I'm tempted to use my credit card and pay for the medication out of pocket.",2025-02-04|2025-02-27|2025-01-30|2025-02-07|2025-02-08|2024-09-05|2025-02-03|2024-12-26,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|1 p.m.",57|55.6|53.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do you need a referral in order to see someone in this facility?

Was referred by my pain management Dr at a large Hospital Group. I'd changed jobs and had a lapse in insurance, so had to go to self pay.  Made an appointment for medication management a month in advance, told them when I booked the appointment that it would be self pay and described my situation in detail. When I arrived at my appointment, they told me they only do ""procedural treatment"" (injections etc...)

I've been through injections, chiropractic and 2 back surgeries in the past 2 years (One being a fusion. For reference... I'm 40 years old and can't perform  daily activities on a regular basis without severe pain) I appreciate them explaining this before I paid $240 out of pocket. The front desk staff was very professional... But they could have told me this a month ago when I made the appointment and provided all of my history. Now I'm back at square one trying to find legitimate pain management.|Love the staff! They are always happy, comforting and give off good energy.
Dr.Dino, he's straightforward, a bit intimidating because he's a tall man- but he couldn't be any nicer. I trust him with my injections. He's also  quick with the procedures & talks to you through the process. Plus, his taste in music is

And yet they're sending me a bill for twenty dollars on a sunday several times today even after i've asked them to stop. Their staff is been nonstop harassing me for a year now. The same way they harassed me when I was a patient there.
Funny thing is the last time I was there over a year ago for an injection, I waited 3 hours past my scheduled time and then when I got testy and started bitching, Dr. Dino came in and told me if I didn't like it, I could find another place to do my injections and so I did, but not before his staff told me. To take off my mask. During covid season and how to staff, people lined up on each side of my bed as they wheeled me in for an injection that I would be sedated for. You can imagine the fear that went through my mind.As they were get glaring down at me, angrily from both sides of my bed. As I was starting to come to in my room, I could hear a nurse or somebody staff, wise saying she won't wake up.
As I came to I got myself dressed and walked out, the building still sedated by myself.
When I went in for a follow up appointment, they didn't bother to notify me and tell me that they're no longer going to see me as a patient. They waited till I got there to tell me that.
They also sent me a letter after that, stating that they'll no longer see me as a patient. So since I have not been there in a year due to their request, how is it? I incured a twenty dollar bill for a recent appointment. A year later, and they're still harassing me. I guess my only other option is to either hire an attorney for harassment.Are contacted better business bureau, or both. Because enough is enough.
I did a screenshot of the bill. They sent me in my email as proof.|I recently been assigned to the Layton ave clinic and see shana.before that I was going to the waukesha clinic.i was a little apprehensive at first but Shana made me feel welcome and she put me at ease.i met ms Shana 3 times and I cud tell she is dedicated to helping me.the staff at the check and check out are very helpful..I'm very grateful I have team of Professionals that will help me
Sincerely Tim k.|have my visit today
list of information, W/C assb. doors,  open , elevators or stairs  has a pharmacy in building|All around horrible experience!

First Issue: They have a centralized answering service that answers, but then they transfer you and you end up in a voice mail box 80% of the time. After a few calls over a few days I was able to get through to schedule an appointment.

Second Issue: A few days before the appointment they call me and tell me my appointment is with a nurse practitioner. They never indicated that to me on the phone when I scheduled. I asked to speak with someone so I could discuss what the appointment would be like since I was seeing a nurse, not a doctor. Apparently their doctors don't see anyone for the initial visit; it's their ""office policy"" that patients meet with a nurse first. I specifically called this office because their DOCTORS had decent ratings; I can't check ratings on their nursing staff and this was not what I expected. But I spoke with the nurse's assistant (who was very nice) and I decided to keep the appointment anyway because all other offices seem to be booked 3-9 months out!

Third Issue: A few weeks later I show up for my appointment EARLY (Layton office in Milwaukee) to fill out paperwork. I approach the office and the door is locked. I wait. Someone finally comes to let me and they don't even say hello. The crowd at the desk looks at me like I'm an annoyance. Then one of them tells they probably can't see me because I needed to be there a HALF AN HOUR before my appointment to fill out the paperwork. What?! They told me 15 minutes early on the phone!! Additionally, if you have a HALF AN HOUR of paperwork, there is a serious administrative issue! But if you honestly think you need 30 minutes of paperwork, then you need to mail it to patients prior to the appointment. She goes to double check with someone in the back and returns to tell me they won't see me and I'll have to reschedule. NO THANKS.

What a hot mess. Take your business elsewhere. Unfortunately now I have to start from square one and reach out to other offices who told there would be a 3-9 month wait for appointments. I wish I had know this place was a joke and I would have saved myself 4 weeks. Now I have to start over. Will be calling my insurance company to complain as well.|This clinic is absolutely amazing. They have gone beyond my expectations to assist with my medical issues. I'm so blessed to have them on the top of my care, truthfully I don't know where I would be at if I didn't have them.

I finally got to see Dr. Sohn. I thought my misery might finally be resolved. I had my MRI, and attended my consultation with an assistant today. I had been on Medicare but recently got married, (literally 3 days ago). I haven't even had time to legally get my info changed. As I was making an appointment to finally get some relief, Kristen came out and Bud into our conversation and said, ""did I hear that you just got married?"", then proceeded to tell me that I could not schedule my injections until I took on my new husbands insurance. All I wanted to do was schedule the procedure. She made a lot of assumptions. When I first came in, I could immediately sense I was being judged by her on what insurance I had. No one needs to feel belittled or less than, she had no clue about my personal situation. The appointment was far enough out where any changes to insurance could have been taken care of or if we even decided to pay for it out of pocket ourselves.  She made me feel looked down upon and there was no care whatsoever about my health or what I had been suffering and how it has affected my quality of life in many aspects. It's very sad that people like her can affect how people perceive the clinic and the doctors that work there. I will no longer be a patient there, and not recommend this place for care for anyone.I did receive a call from an office management and they made light of her attitude. People that work in healthcare should be empathetic and put their patients care first.|I was seen here right after APM went bankrupt and never told any of us.  I seen Dr Sohn and was planning on getting a spinal cord stimulator.  I was so full of hope!!!  Hope that I could be out of this miserable pain I'm in 24/7!!!!

I went through all of the tests and visits to be approved for the SCS.  I was approved and over the moon excited!!!!  I finally had hop for a better life.   I wasn't sure about the clinic because of the bankruptcy so I went to my PCP and got Suboxone for pain and it's made a substantial difference!  I'm not in severe pain anymore and don't have to deal with injections that never worked and numerous procedures that never did a thing!

What happened???  I was not in miserable pain!  So when my appointment came to get the SCS I cancelled at the last minute.  I went for another visit at WSP and was excited to tell them how great I felt,!!!  That the sun finally came out and I could function and have QOL!  I thought they'd be really happy for me!!

I left there sobbing in tears!!! No not tears of joy.  Years of sadness and hurt because the NP yelled at me and bersted me for going to the clinic!!  Stated why didn't u let us help you????

I never went back again because of this awful treatment!|Dr. Sohn is extremely professional and caring. He explains your condition and treatment plan thoroughly, and always provides options.
He stays involved with his patients issues, and agrees to work with your surgeons, to keep pain at a minimum.
Carmen, the receptionist, is very warm and friendly. She always greets you with a warm smile and a kind word
The nursing staff is equally friendly and caring. They take care to insure you're comfortable before, during and after your procedure!|Dr. Sohn was really great at letting me know what to expect.  His nursing staff was amazing.  Not only friendly but got the iv in on the first try, which doesn't happen often.  His receptionists are on top of his schedule, answer your phone calls and get you in when you need to see him or his nursing staff.  Let alone they are also friendly and wonderful to work with.|Carmen and Kristal do an amazing job. They are always friendly and efficient. I really dislike going to the doctor but these young ladies make it pleasantly bearable.

Dr Sohn does a great job too. He doesn't rush and listens. Explains your condition and the best treatment plan.

I really appreciate them for making my pain bearable.

Thank you!

Jo L Chester|From the first day I called for it appointment everyone was so nice. I felt they went above and beyond looking into what my insurance would cover even though they were out of network for me.
Dr. Sohn made me feel like I'm not crazy about the chronic pain I have had for many years. Right away I trusted that he could help me. I can't wait to get the treatment under way.|Dr. Sohn. Is very professional & will explain things so patients understand & Carmen @ the front desk is great & will go out of her way to help but Prior authorization  is terrible @ least for someone who is out of Network! Then as for the physic evaluation that is needed for spine stimulator is whole different story @ least getting it covered out of network & having all prior authorization in place before the evaluation! That part was very frustrating otherwise 5 stars all the way! Great staff
Thank you for all your help|I want to thank Dr Sohn for being professional as well as his staff.

They talk about you and down to you. After months of mistreatment by the receptionist, I finally inquired as to why she had such an issue and I was then dismissed from their clinic as they sided with their staff and not their patients. I had been coming to their clinic for 9 years, drive over an hour to get there and to be treated as such and dismissed like I don't even matter by a provider is sad and unprofessional. The receptionist attempted to fight me because her attitude was uncalled for and was redirected by another staff member. I hope they do better in the future.|My provider (Mary K.) always asks how I'm doing all-around, in addition to prescribing medication. She really listens to me. The clinical RN coordinator, Kathryn, is quick to assist with working with my insurance company when pre-authorizations are needed. The front staff who check people in and schedule appointments are great, as well. I always know what to expect when I go there, which is nice.
I'm updating this as of Dec/2022; still a very helpful place to come to.|Today was my first appointment. This is the first place I've gone to for pain help and I felt like someone cared. They listen to you, and never rush. They cover all the basics if you receive medications from them.
They test and do pill counts. They seem very intelligent and worry about the comfort of the patient, not just worry about their license. I've been in extreme pain for a while now and I actually finally feel hopeful for my future, knowing I have someone that has my back.
If you've been to other pain management doctor's you probably know how they treat people who need opiates to manage pain, (You almost feel like a criminal for asking for help) but not here. I've never had someone genuinely care about how chronic pain effected my life.
I highly recommend them. They also have physical therapy at their office and I'm excited to start there soon.|Update: I had been with the clinic for years. I had seen all the staff and felt I could be open and honest with just about anyone in the clinic. But one day out of the blue I got a phone call stating I was being dismissed because after going through the past YEAR of my records, I had been constantly testing at ZERO meds in my system and that I was being discharge just like that. Going off high doses of pain meds cold turkey can even land a person with certain other conditions in the hospital and can last up to two weeks or more. I was given 7 days of meds. The worst of it usually starts at day 7.

My husband dropped off a current test from my primary taken not even two hours after i left from my last appt at the clinic and that test reflected that I had all the appropriate meds in my system and none I wasn't supposed to have. Just like the review before mine, I was dismissed with no meds to wean down and I was told THROUGH MY HUSBAND that they also said I was not following up with other providers as I was told.

I never gave them permission to talk to him. They had permission to release a receipt and later my medical records. Those are supposed to come in a sealed envelope. So I guess when I run out of meds, I'm supposed to just be sick.

They did give me a number of meds that helped not much and meds I was allergic to along with meds I am already prescribed and meds I can't take due to other interactions: it's sad that I thought I was being responsible and had NOT broken my pain agreement. They could have just told me I had a month to find another provider.

But I got a phone call as I was pulling into work and was just told. Only one business day before my next appointment. So I guess stay on their good side and you are good to go, but they just decide things and things that were just not ethical all around.

If I had been testing negative for ONE YEAR, I should have been made aware, then given a warning that I would be discharged. Plus they have a drug screen my doctor did and it was completely opposite. I couldn't just have taken my meds in that hour and a half then tested positive for all my meds I was supposed to be on and this is just too bad.

I won't be able to work now until I'm done being sick from withdrawal because you can't just stop meds of this kind. What they prescribe to sort of help doesn't even come close to even helping a little. So no work.

Plus I was given meds I can't take due to allergies and I had to hear from my husband something completely false and they were never given permission to tell him anything. He was just allowed to pick up papers twice.
That does not give an assumed permission.

So good luck, I wish you well and thank you for putting me through this. UNETHICAL and very opposite of their description of care. This wasn't compassionate or ongoing because if they saw a problem one year ago, why dismiss patients on no notice? I think they need to change that. And note that only my review and the one below are from dates with the current owners and staff. The rest are with totally different providers and office managers.|The staff as a whole treats me like family I lost my dad, mom and cousin and they really showed concern and empathy. When I walk in here I feel like I'm amongst caring people they know when I'm sad or happy I love the energy they give me. The best part of coming here they don't treat me like a number they treat me like I matter I've been told to keep my head up, keep striving for greatness because I talk to the youth and countless other things. It's not just going to pain management but also seeing a psychologist. We need more people and places like this I'm grateful for them.|They are very strict on guidelines and look for alternative options other than opioids . My practitioner has gotten to know me very well and asks all the right questions related to my health/ pain.

Melisa Kametler|ATTENTION VETERANS/SPOUSES that may be considering using community care referrals here - I would highly advise against sending anyone who is precious to you, to this place. I am my husbands caregiver in every capacity of the term. My husband was disrespected, called a pill seeker, and was not listened to by his pain management doctor.

Dr. John Joesph's bedside manner is awful. He appears to not thoroughly read the charts and makes assumptions on if you have PTSD/Anxiety disorders. He does not listen to the patient. If you find yourself reading his doctor profile and think to yourself that he would be a good fit, he is far from compassionate. Look elsewhere.

And forget about patient confidentiality in the office. Courtney at the front desk is inappropriate in complaining about patients. Don't worry, the rest of the office and patients waiting can hear her airing complaints too. She is very rude and sarcastic and feels as if she can do whatever she pleases with no consequences for her unprofessional behavior. SHAMEFUL!

After 6 months of no improvements with his pain management care, we decided to reach out to his primary care team at the VA to get a new referral to someone who was more professional, who listens to the patient and is caring.

Upon notification of the referral, Courtney and her high horse demeanor, decided that my husband would not get his next month's prescription to allow him time to get a new provider established. She stated that it was a breach of pain management contract to ask for another provider at this location or any other pain provider. Because you are not allowed to disagree with the provider or the course of treatment. You are also not allowed to advocate for yourself or think you deserve better care and treatment.

She then proceeded to harass me about why I call on my husbands behalf. Any spouse of a disabled veteran can attest to being heavily involved in their partners care management. We the spouses are often their biggest support system and advocate. We are there to ensure our veterans are being taken care of with dignity and respect.

This morning again, Courtney called my husband a pill seeker and a doctor shopper to me over the phone. If you have any self respect, this isn't the place for you or your loved ones.

I have never been one to post reviews unless they are positive. However, I could not live with myself knowing that other Honorable Veterans with chronic pain could be referred here and so disrespected. If I could be allowed to post without any stars, you bet that's what they deserve a ZERO.

Our hopes in reaching out to you is that you can use your own platforms to shed light in this dark corner of poor community care providers for Veterans.|My experience at Integrated Pain Manegment has been exactly what I was exactly what I was seeking.  Help for my pain. I have nothing but praise for Dr Joseph.  When he first interviewed me he was very thorough. Listed my pain in levels of worst first. He really listened to me.

The staff and the Nurse Practitioner I met with, were particularly understanding and gave me adequate time to explain my situation.
I found them to be very helpful and willing to help with my questions.
I'll be going back for a follow up in 2 weeks.
I'm really looking forward to working with them.|I've been coming to PSP for many years now. I started when they were Advanced Pain management and will always continue. The nurses are so nice. My PA Kim and Kelsey listen and are very in tune to what I need. Appointment's are easy to get. I know a lot of people might be thinking ugh, not a PA. Don't worry on this. You'll see a doctor too. He's nice.|I would like to thank everyone at Pro Spine & Pain Clinic. From the appointment makers to Dr. Aasen and his crew, and everyone in between. They are personal, very caring, professional, and compassionate. The procedures they do are awesome. I would recommend anybody to go to this clinic!!!|I went to a new pain clinic today, and I met with my new doctor, face-to-face. He examined me, spoke with me and prescribed treatment that should have been undertaken before my first SCS. He addressed my months-long elevated pain and need for more than begging for a Tylenol 3, like I'm some heroin addict looking for recreation.  And I don't know what lab the clinic Pro Spine uses, but they need to clean up their act. I tested positive for morphine, which has been on my allergy list for 30 years.  That should have been a huge red flag as to the test validity.

To top their performance, as a reaction to my elevated pain, they prescribed Tramadol/Ultram, another medication that has been on my allergy list for 30 years.

After pointing out this bad prescription, they ""fired"" me as a patient, citing too much contact. If you can't call your pain doctor four times in a week (because they're not calling you back), there are bigger issues at play.

I was in the ER twice in a week, but Pro Spine sat on their hands. They finally went totally crazy and gave me a steroid pack after the second ER visit. They wanted me to travel two hours (one way) to relinquish the wimpy T3s and prove pill count so I could get the prescription on my allergy list.  And now I'm also facing another surgery to replace the SCS they recommended.  Bad support for the SCS, but also nearly impossible to charge.  I'm on a fast-track to bankruptcy thanks to ""providers"" like Pro Spine because I need to get back to work, not guinea-pig at their leisure while I can't even meet with a doctor.

Quite possibly the most incompetent ""specialists,"" given that my pain has increased and gone unaddressed under their care.

Finally, if a certain doctor has had issues with opioid prescriptions in the past (yes) then he may need to change his shingle.  But a pain practice that can't relieve pain; and a pain practice that blocks patients from their own doctors is hugely problematic.

Thank you for firing me as a patient so I could move forward. I'm not so appreciative of the six months of torture.|Everyone at APT are amazing and very helpful. I have been in pain for couple years and doctors wouldn't actually listen. With the referral I received to go to APT I wasn't very hopeful as I've been ignored and brushed off for so many years. Once I started the staff LISTENED and spoke to me like I was a human being.I seen Dr Orji and he was awesome he listened and gave tips not only for my back but also for weight loss and his advice has worked amazing. Then I seen Chris he actually shown how he cares for his patients. Now we are on the same page and on the right track to them helping me on managing my pain.  I would recommend these Drs to anyone who is in pain.They are absolutely amazing and you can see the pride they take in caring for their patients.|My experience with Pain Physicians of Wisconsin has been wonderful! Kim Litwack has been nothing but kind, caring, and empathetic as to my chronic pain condition and how it's affecting my life. She REALLY listens to me and talks to me even about what's going on in my personal life with my family. I usually end up crying at pretty much every visit, and she always gives me a long hug before I leave. She's been a great pain provider for me by listening to me and how I'm being affected, and also taking my suggestions about pain control into consideration. I would recommend her to anyone dealing with significant pain that needs help in managing it!! Edit: Things DID start out going really well with her. However, unfortunately, things ended up going really really aweful. I ended up with serotonin syndrome, because she didn't have the complete records of my medications, such as the dosages that I was on. So I was on a very high dosage of an antidepressant, along with taking pain medication 4 times a day. (This is all because the previous place went bankrupt, and now Advanced Pain Management had the rest of my medical records, which failed to transfer over to Kim's office.) I have an EXTREMELY painful medical condition called Adhesive Arachnoiditis. With the Serotonin Syndrome, my blood pressure was very high, I was tachycardic, I was constantly having muscle spasms, I couldn't get my words out straight, I was extremely irritable, and it was like my chronic pain on steroids! This lasted for MANY months on end. I'd call them and call them and report my symptoms to them, but they either wouldn't take me seriously, or would tell me to go to the ER. But the ER would never do anything for me. I had already tried that before. It took ME figuring out over time what was going on between the two medications. I even asked her at my last appointment: ""Is it ok to take this med and this med together?"" She goes: ""Oh yes, it's perfectly fine!"" Well, I don't think she ever looked up the interactions, because when I did, it said: ""Major: Using these together can increase the risk of a rare but serious condition called Serotonin Syndrome."" I was at the max dose of my antidepressant. So it's no wonder that happened to me while also being on the pain med at the same time. So, since I was in such horrendous pain, what did they decide to do? Increase my dose of pain medication. When that's not what needed to happen. Although at that time, I still didn't know what was going on with me. Plus, when she gave me the extended release version of the new pain med, she didn't give me instructions for stopping the old one and starting the new one. I eventually had to figure out that I needed to get off of my antidepressant with the help of my Psychiatrist. After I did that, guess what? My pain medication worked SO much better for me, and I was no longer having the Serotonin Syndrome effects. In the end, I left Kim, and now I'm just with my PCP. I'm using LDN to manage my pain, along with other therapies. I truly hope that they have things put together a lot better than they did when I was going there. Because that was a HUGE patient safety risk, and I told Kim that on my last visit with her!|I can only say Great Things about Dr. Orji and his staff during my recent visits for epidural injections.   They did everything possible to make my treatment as painless as possible.   The entire Staff was very professional and sympathetic to my wants and needs.  I would strongly recommend them for treatment.|The staff at Advanced Pain Treatment, especially Dr. Fattouh, have truly given me my life back! He is an amazing physician; his care and procedures have been the first and only thing that has given me enough pain control to function in the world again. I have now gone back to work and am also able to be the mother that I wanted to be. I cannot say enough wonderful things in a short review!

Pro Spine was my 4th pain doctor that I tried because the initial 3 doctors were ineffective and I fired them. While in #9 pain, the beginning with Pro Spine seemed too slow, but these folks delivered. In all my pain elimination efforts, my 11th spine surgery is scheduled in a few weeks which will be for a permanent installation of a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS)... hopefully is the last. Hats off to the skills of Dr Stauss (and praise to God) for the progress made that has me the best functioning since the accident. It's a tough truth to realize I'll not be the same as before the accident, but, that is life. At least I can better interact with my grandkids now and occasionally volunteer to help others in doing home maintenance work which I enjoy.

I brought it ti there attention and they were ruid and not very helpful at all. Either was the woman head of billing. I know most of you are on fixed incomes so every little bit we need. Took 2 months or so and still did not get any results. Finally I approached HR Kevin he was amazing listened and agreed that I deserve my refund. Still no refund. Finally Debra and Kevin took matters in there own hands spoke to there ppl. Worked together and I got a call from Debra saying my refund would be mailed. Now she is customer service wen you walk in . Greets us with smiles and cheer does our paperwork and sets up appts for us. I personally look forward to seeing her wen I get there she is amazing at her job. Now like I said that is her job Debra and Kevin worked together and talked ti the right ppl and next thing I know I was being sent my refund. Now why didn't the head of billing and billing didn't respond like Debra and Kevin dud. I was told it was out of my hands. Well that is funny cuz Debra and Kevin went   out of there way to make it right. I am very grateful for them. There efforts were amazing and made me feel heard. They deserve to be recognized in that Clinic for there amazing and very empathic efforts to get my refund and make things right. I am very grateful for them and very much appreciated what they did for me. So thank you from the bottom of my heart for getting my refund and making me feel important and heard. I can't say enough that deserve to be recognized.  There isn't ppl like them in companies anymore . So once again Debra and Kevin thank you and you make me wanna keep coming back and knowing if I had concerns you both you be there for me and make me feel heard.

I saw chiropractors, PTs, and massage therapists religiously during these 9 months and even purchased a new mattress. Unfortunately, with no signs of any tears and no acute injury, my pain and limited ROM was a mystery to all. That was until my massage therapist found a nerve entrapment technique on Instagram. As a last ditch effort, she suggested I give Pivotal Point a shot. I was skeptical, but after watching a few patients issues and treatments videos I figured it may be the answer to my mysterious shoulder pain. After meeting with Dr Ben and his team, we identified the likely cause of my pain and limited functionality. After a few treatments, my pain was significantly reduced and my range of motion continued to improve. Now, at the end of my case, I have regained full range of motion and functionality without pain. I am have since been able to hit lifts in the gym that I was hitting 100% healthy, like nothing ever happened.  Had I not found Dr Ben, I likely would have had an unnecessary surgery that would have left me unable to ever attain my previous level of fitness. I am so thankful for the power of social media and providers that will explore all options before resorting to surgical intervention. THANK YOU PIVOTAL POINT!|For over 20 years, I endured relentless chronic pain. Countless treatments offered me nothing more than fleeting relief. As a mother of two, the anguish went beyond physical. It broke my heart to miss out on precious moments with my children. I longed to be the mother they deserved, but my mental health was crumbling under the constant pain. My options were narrowing down to invasive exploratory surgery or lifelong shots--neither of which promised a hopeful future.

Then, through a serendipitous click on a YouTube video, I found Dr. Ben. Desperation led me to take a chance on him, thinking, ""It can't get any worse than this."" Little did I know, this decision would become a monumental turning point in my life.

Dr. Ben and his compassionate staff have given me something I hadn't experienced in over two decades--true relief. For the first time, I have been virtually pain-free for more than two months. I have reclaimed my mobility, strength, and mental well-being. I am finally able to be the mother my children deserve. We play, we go for walks, and I no longer have to say, ""Mommy can't, she doesn't feel good.""

Dr. Ben is nothing short of a miracle worker. His dedication, empathy, and personal story are incredibly inspiring. He doesn't just treat the symptoms; he genuinely cares about his patients' overall well-being. I am profoundly grateful for taking a chance on Dr. Ben and his amazing team.

Today, my life is filled with possibilities. I feel empowered, resilient, and ready to conquer anything life throws my way. If you are suffering from chronic pain and feel like you've exhausted all options, don't give up hope. Dr. Ben's clinic may very well be the light at the end of the tunnel, just as it was for me. He has not only restored my health but also my ability to live life to the fullest. God Bless you, Dr. Ben and all you do to help people in the most difficult times in their lives, you have a heart of gold!|WOWWW.. just wow. All I can say is Dr. Ben and his knowledge of practice are truly incredible. Within just a few sessions I already felt an insane amount of relief in my lower back. Before I found Pivotal Point -- I had been out of the gym for 4 months with pain crippling enough to immobilize me and now just 10 sessions later I'm back to lifting heavy in the gym again with even better range of motion. I can't recommend him and his team enough! The best investment I made for my health, hands down! Thanks for giving me my life back!|When your life consists of just merely surviving each day because you've been in chronic pain for years, you'll try anything. That's what I did. Dozens of people in lab coats led me to have major spine surgery, and when that failed, 12 nerve ablations. They got paid, I got significantly worse. At 34 years old, even walking to my own mailbox would send me into a flare. With a toddler and a growing small business, I had all the motivation to get better. I tried a dozen or more treatments in the two years following these medical procedures. Laser, PT, Chiropractic, Dry Needling, Injections, Acupuncture, Braces, Medications, the list goes on. With each failed treatment I felt more hopeless and depressed wondering if my three year old will ever see his mom active and vibrant, as I once was. I found Dr Ben in a late night desperate googling session. I figured this had to be the only thing I hadn't tried, and had very little expectations, as no one I had ever seen had ever mentioned adhesion. Dr Ben and his staff immediately did things different. They took so much time during that first appointment measuring all the angles of my range of motion and really digging into my case. They wanted all of my previous imaging, which made me feel like this might be the real deal. Apprehensively, I dove right in because I had nothing left to lose. I am a really complex case and probably one of their more hopeless patients, but they have given me so much hope. After a few months, I can confidently say that I am already 30% better than I was - which to me, feels like a miracle in itself. These guys are the real deal. If I could go back in time, I would have come here first and have no doubt they could have helped me avoid this low point in my life, but I am so thankful to have found them now! I have all the confidence in the world that I will keep improving in their care. I would give them 10 stars if I could. If you're in pain, please give Dr Ben a call. He knows what he's doing, he's honest & realistic, and he cares about the people he serves!|I used to have really bad inner shoulder blade pain until I met Dr. Ben. I limited myself for so long. Suffered for so long. I was told by a chiropractor & massage therapist nothing could be done, I would need surgery, it's too far under my shoulder blade. I couldn't do more than an hour of homework w/out wanting to cut my whole arm off. I couldn't clean my shower or vacuum. I pushed through, of course. Things need to get done. Dr. Ben fixed me! This man can fix just about anything with minimal pain. A truly amazing man w/a good heart & wonderful bedside manners. He's very respectful, professional, always available, listens, & cares.

Dr. Ben's assistant, Jay, that young man is the highlight of my day! He's so sweet & spunky. He always makes me laugh. His positive energy radiates throughout the office making it a welcoming & safe space.

1,000,000/10  RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!|Dr. Ben and his team have done wonders for my mobility and ongoing back issues.  For reference I am a woman in my 30s have had 2 babies, been in multiple car accidents and in December of 2022 was diagnosed with Transverse Myletis.  I came to Dr. Ben with both ongoing pain in my lower back (for years) and numbness/mobility issues from my recent TM neurological stuff.  Through his therapy over the course of months I began to regain feeling in multiple places I had lost it and my back pain has disappeared completely most days.  Additionally, my range of motion and mobility is back at about 90 percent.  Where we thought we might be able to get a 20 to 30 percent improvement in my mobility and quality of life we ended up in the 75 to 80 percent improved realm and are still working.  I loved Dr. Ben and his teams transparency and honestly from the beginning.  He was always completely honest on whether or not he could help and set realistic expectations for real quantifiable change.  Unlike many doctors that ego trip and sell things as if they can completely fix everything you can count on Dr. Ben to be real and speak to you with honesty and clarity.  I highly recommend his services to anyone with ongoing mobility or pain issues.  He will be real with you and if you trust the process you will see an incredible improvement in your pain, mobility and quality of life.  Its unlike any other medical process I have encountered.  Call him and get your life back!|I had knee pain for 5 or more years. It prevented me from many tasks that normally would be easy to accomplish. I started visiting Dr. Ben and I was amazed that the level of pain largely diminished and nearly a year later is 90% gone. Thank you Dr. Ben|This place is Awesome! Definitely a place to check out if you've been struggling with long-term chronic pain. Dr. Ben will make you feel heard and will be honest with you when it comes to your rehabilitation process. He isn't the type to waste your time or money, he will sit down with you and make a personalized treatment plan with honest and realistic expectations. Again I would highly recommend.

Their manners, customer service, wait time, its all chaotic. My clients appointments be at 10 am, for example, the called physician doesn't see the client until 12:30 or beyond.  The whole day is wasted, and I feel for my clients. They only see the patients for 10 minutes. The whole time interrogating them on if their pain is really affecting them or not.

My son goes to this school, and I absolutely love how patient the staff are with the students and they take their time with the students like my son who is a special needs students.

If there is a problem they don't just say this is something YOU need to work on, instead the staff say this is something WE all need to work on as a team.  The after school program is excellent as well.|I went to this clinic trusting that in my condition they really cared. Every time I went in there was a problem with my meds. I was discharged due to a issue I believe they just came up with to discharge me cause I always disagreed with the doctor Michael. I was functioning much better on my meds. My stability was much better when walking. I was able to function and get out more often with much less pain. You can see the pain I am in when I walk, yet I was discharged for what I believe to be a made up reason. People come into this office walking like they are in much better condition, and much younger yet they don't get discharged. Not a fair place. I even had a friend help me pay to come here for months for my meds when they barely had business.|I was a patient with this doctor before she moved from Wheaton on highway 100 and bluemond. Its was a more pleasant professional experience then. Now since she has moved on 62 and Center Im treated with no respect the staff takes weeks to answer the phone or return messages. They are rude and everytime im tested for meds there is always a issue. I complained to the doctor about how im treated and how the staff is unprofessional and I got repimanded as if i work for the doctor.

I have a feeling they were not abiding by the rules and did not like the consequences...

Dr Priyani is the best medical thing to happen to me in a really long time. He really cares about his patients and the staff is amazing! Can't imagine life without them. THANKS SPINE PAIN DIAGNOSTICS|Everyone at Spine Pain Diagnostics has been pleasant to work with from the start.Dr Piryani is very straight forward, and he listens. They seem to really care about your problems. I just had an epidural procedure in July and the experience was so much better than I had feared/built it up to be. Very simple, professional, and done with great care. I don't want just anyone messing with my spinal cord! I highly recommend these folks if you need help. My issue is spondylolisthyesis. So far the improvement has been noticeable.|I had an overall great experience with the spine pain diagnostics associates. The staff was courteous and attentive, Dr. Piryani explained everything in detail that would go on and made me comfortable. The procedure I had performed exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend Dr. Piryani and the spine pain diagnostics associates, and all of the staff.|My husband had been going to Aurora pain management for 5 months and they did not manage his pain. We came to Dr. Piryani, he gave him a thorough examination, reviewed his MRI and x-rays and scheduled him for a cortisone epidural within 2 weeks, and prescribed him the appropriate medication. Dr. Piryani called him twice after the epidural to check his progress. His staff is also very attentive.|Dr. Piryani is an amazing pain doctor. He is very compassionate and listens to your questions and concerns. He and his excellent staff are so kind and supportive! I was in pain for over a year ( could barely walk without being in tremendous pain) and Dr. Piryani literally gave me my life back!  My quality of life has improved greatly.  It's great not to have pain take over your life! The pain I had even stopped me from taking vacations. It's a huge relief  to me and my family that I have found a doctor that helped relieve my pain! Sincerely, Ann Becker|I have experienced back pain for a number of years now and my most recent treatment performed by Dr. Piryani is by far the most successful.  I was able to resume normal activities in just one day.  I used to have to rely on an ice bag to help numb the pain but no more.  I sleep better and have the best mobility in a long time.  I highly recommend this clinic.|I have been with this office for a while now. I deal with Dr. Piryani and he is a most helpful doctor, I trust him completely. His staff are also very helpful. All of the staff and doctors are very personable and know their jobs inside and out. Whenever I have had injections, I can easily trust them to keep me safe. I recommend this office and doctors over anyone I have dealt with.|3 TIMES A WINNER!!!  Back in 2020, I was referred to Dr. Piryani for intercostal rib pain, which was severe! He did some nerve block shots and to this day, which is over a year ago, I still do not have any residual pain. Then in May of 2021, I had hip and groin pain. Again, he administered some cortisone injections and the pain was gone. Recently, I was having mid-back muscle issues, in which my muscles were severely tight that I couldn't move real well. Once again, he administered steroid injections and again I am pain free! Dr. Piryani will go above and beyond to help his patients and so will his staff. They all are kind, knowledgeable and professional! I wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone to Dr. Piryani! He will always be my choice for pain management! Thank you Dr. Piryani for helping me not once, not twice, but three times!!!",2023-10-31|2019-08-22|2021-04-24|2021-10-25|2017-06-15|2019-02-28|2017-08-18|2021-08-07,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJwdZhwlzhBIgR2xKtRRTGRBs,31

Bryan|Very pleasant place to go for pain management. Staff is very nice and care about how you feel. The doctors and physician assistants are knowledgeable and also care about the patient themselves. Insurance approval does usually take a couple weeks to go through! That is not the fault of the clinic. I am very happy to be coming here because they try to fix the problems and not just mask the pain with meds.|I saw the nurse Practitioner last week and before that visit I thought that my depression about my pain was getting better but now I feel like there is no hope that I will ever get any better. I was told that I had been given a procedure for the wrong area and not where my pain was located. I was told that there wasn't much else they could do for me and that I was bad for taking pain medication for my years of unending severe round the clock pain. I feel that I have nothing left to live for except pain.|They wouldn't listen, and became defensive when I asked questions. I was spoken down to, and dismissed. My son who's 5 asked why the doctors were so mean. All I want is to be a better mom and not just observe my son. I haven't been below an 8 on the pain scale in months, yet with extreme fatigue they want to put me on a muscle relaxer during the day with awful side effects. ( drowsiness being the least of the worries now) they also said I just need to cope with my worsening pain, since (without trying anything) all options are apparently exhausted. With increasing neuropathy on my right side they won't even have an MRI done of my back, they just assume it's okay.|First off,  I was treated as though I was a heroin addict or something in my first visit.  It took 6 weeks for them to schedule a follow up vist to see the results of my urine sample.  Prior to the follow up visit I was told that I had been approved to take pain meds.  Then, when i get there and see the dr..who was actually sympathetic (she was from CO) I was denied pain medication since I had taken CBD oil and it had traces of THC.  I am trying to stay away from pain medication but have 3 herniated disc in my back and one in my neck.  Sometimes it just helps me to sleep.  If I were to go back in for a follow up to take another urine sample it would take up to 2 weeks to get it back.  I get that the gov has a lot to do with this but they don't manage how you treat people.  If you want to be treated with dignity and empathy and are going through serious pain don't go to this place.  I would give zero stars if possible.  If you are already a patient here , remember that you have the freedom to change providers.|This is the worst medical facility ever! First, they told me AS I WAS GOING IN FOR A PAIN INJECTION, that I'd have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket! Then when I asked for an insurance review, they took months, gave me a huge run around, and then gave me incorrect information. I switched doctors, and now it's taking me weeks, and more hoops, to get their reports over to him! Not only that, they are rude, abrupt and impatient, liabilities when dealing with people in acute pain. No humanity, no efficiency, no care. Stay Away!|Dr Endrezzi  warning dont see her. Most uncaring, cold, rude doctor Ive ever been to. Told I had to be off pain medication in 2 months, after 20 plus yrs of use for extremely painful conditions. Then radio ablation done took 6 months for for 2 test blocks then actual procedure. Then when needed more hip injections,  told I needed an office visit first. Why??? Already had had those done before. They just want money for extra visit. Terrible practice!!!!!!|Dr. Kirchin is skilled and personable, but the communication skills of the office and staff leave much to be desired.  They don't tell the patient what to expect beforehand, they are abrupt on the phone (a hang up by a staff member), they made an appointment with an APRN for me and I found out about the appointment via MyChart.  One would expect the would call and ask what would be a good day & time and tell me why I was meeting with a new person.....Nope!

George was extremely rude throughout the entire visit, although he tried hard to hide the fact that he either had a reason to dislike me after immediately meeting me the first few minutes or just doesn't like his job very much I'm not sure but he was very rude very short very curt with me and I seen the doctor for maybe a total of two minutes where he spoke very fastly. I'm 100% not exaggerating that he was in my room for a total of 3 minutes. This is all happening before my surgery mind you so I have a ton of questions. I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. The doctor told me that he had to go call my surgeon to touch base and he would be right back at that time I was taken to go do labs. I thought I was gonna go back to see the doctor after that because I had tons of questions and then the nurse George, set me in the waiting room and says I'll let you know if the doctor needs anything else from you. I expressed to the nurse that I still needed stuff from him. I have questions. I need to talk to him and he rudely interrupted me and spoke to me like a child ""that is why I'm going to ask him if he still needs you"" was his exact words not OK I'll make sure he knows that you still have questions for him , I was also promised a call back because again they did not give me any follow up instructions or any instructions at all. I had questions about the day before the operation on what medications I'm supposed to take and not take now I have no idea of any of that because he wouldn't call me back and it's Friday. I stupidly went home and fell asleep before it was early enough to call him back so that on my part is my fault but I am very unhappy with the treatment I received , I'm a person, I'm scared and they did nothing to help ease that. Now I see my surgeon Monday and I have no idea if he got any of  the answers to questions he wanted either. I don't know if I'm supposed to take my normal medication's the day of surgery, nothing. This is a surgery that can't be put off much longer before my bones are healing the wrong way. I don't feel like I was treated like a person today. I literally feel like they just shoved me out as quick as they can and I understand it can get busy but each Doctor should spend as much time with a patient as the patient needs within reason. He sent some random lady out and told me to leave by the way not even the rude nurse George so I could look at George and say well I still have questions. I'm gonna wait. I have no idea who the woman was or and when I explained to her while I still needed to talk to him. She said well he's going to call you again. I never received a call. I would not recommend this to anyone if you can avoid it. This was my first encounter and they made me feel so bad about myself And left me still scared I was hoping for answers today because I've been terrified about the aftermath of this surgery as I will have rods and screws put in This doctor couldn't even give me five minutes of his day to let me know what he was going to do.|",2024-09-27|2024-09-25,1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ-SDuIyBDBYgRuiPEfWHQMso,2

I was told about an App and a book.
This was literally the worst thing you could have given someone in the state I was in.
My body is not hyper aware, I do not have fibromyalgia, this is not in my head, it's not a mystery illness that no one can see, the pain was caused by an accident.
Finally I found a doctor who confirmed the pain is coming from the torn muscle. Not anything else.

I have been seeing him for lower back pain.  Clair, his NP, saw me first and reviewed my symptoms and x-rays.  She brought Dr. Purewal in and they both agreed that steroid shots for my back would help.  They were very professional and took the time  to listen to me about my concerns.  We were able to get those shots scheduled in a timely fashion.    I was back to feeling better in no time.  Thank you to Dr. Purewal and his staff for helping me.|I had an appointment with Dr Purewal on 1.23.23. I was told that masks were optional for patients. However, it was mandatory for staff. After meeting with the medical assistant and the NP, a man walked in. He introduced himself as Dr Purewal. Should I believe him??? A man walked in with scrubs on, no lab coat, and no name tag.The scrubs looked like he slept in them. Not very professional. I was most impressed with the fact that he walked in carrying a mask, which he never did put on his face. He asked me where the pain was. I told him head to toe. He said, in your back. The NP began to explain my back problems. The NP and the Dr were talking as if my spine wasn't bone on bone, as described by my spine Dr. Then, Purewal began to discuss steroid injections. I told him that my throat closes from steroids. I had told him about an episode that I had experienced in the hospital. I had received a steroid injection through my iv and shortly after, I couldn't breathe. My throat was closed and I was choking. The nurse had called my Dr and was instructed to put my bed at a 90 degree angle. I sat that way for hours. There was nothing that could be done. I had to wait for the steroids to work their way through my system. Purewal said that was impossible. I had said that all medicines are preservative free??? He said, don't tell me how to do my job. I said that I'm asking. He said that all steroids that are injected into the body are safe and there are no possibilities of side effects. He also said,I must have been nervous when I received the steroids. Which explains my breathing issue. There are plenty of side effects with steroids. Purewal didn't like the fact that I said no to steroid injections. Then, he had said that I was in the wrong place. I said, I guess that I am in the wrong place and grabbed my purse and jacket and walked out.

Per internet search:  ""Hypersensitivity reactions to steroids are divided into two categories. Immediate reactions, such as Anaphylaxis, which occur within an hour of drug administration and Delayed Reactions, such as Contact Dermatitis, which occur after an hour of drug administration.""

Just because I have a reaction to a medication that Purewal never heard of, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. He wasn't there with me when I had trouble breathing. I know what happened. For all I know, the reaction that I had was a one in a million chance. No physician of any specialty should disregard what a patient reports has happened to them, regarding a medication. I will never return to Purewal for any medical reason. Hopefully, whoever is reading this review, will think long and hard before choosing Purewal.|Dr.Purewal was unprofessional and not concerned with patient care at all.  The nurses could not find a vein to insert medication and had to hit my fiance's wrist which shows how uneducated his staff is (over a week later his wrist is all bruised up).  We scheduled a simple injection for back pain caused by two botched back surgeries in the past from doctors at St. Luke's Hospital.  We have gone through chiropractors, acupuncture, physical therapy, medications, cortisone injections, etc...Purewal stated after the procedure when we asked what the next step would be and after speaking with him it was so hard to understand his ENGLISH that he cut us off and said he does not make a lot of money and spending 20-30 mins was all he had time for so we should schedule a follow up appointment.  There was NO WAY we were coming back so we had to tell the 2 giggling girls on their phones to please cancel any appointment that was scheduled and they laughed and said ""bye"".  This is not a joke and this dr. and his staff were not at all interested in comprehensive PAIN & SPINE treatment.  Save your $ and time.  Two days later we went to see our PCP and he laughed at Dr.Purewal and told us to NEVER return to him again.  He had an attitude from the moment I read his lips to understand  him and was so negative it was depressing.  I warn anyone going to the clinic off of S. 20th Street between Oklahoma and Morgan.  The only reason for the 1 star was the initial intake reception area had nice ladies working the desk.  All the rest of the staff FAILED.|Every appointment is very informative he's understanding, he also takes the time to listen..

Over the past year, I have struggled with pain in my hip/sciatic area and it has completely taken over my life. I am an active and athletic person! I saw two different chiropractors, a sports medicine doctor, and even did physical therapy. None of it gave me relief that lasted.

I found Dr. Scott through a friend on social media and I knew I had to give it a try. I am SO happy I did because I can finally say I am on the right path and have been CLOSE TO PAIN FREE. I am almost to my ""taper"" point in my sessions and I couldn't be happier. I can now do my workouts daily with no pain and I haven't been able to say that in over a year.

Thank you to Dr. Scott and his team! They are amazing and make you feel so comfortable when you come into the office. It is worth it. TAKE THE CHANCE if you have tried everything, like me!! (:|I found Select Pain Care while on Instagram. Having played college, pro and high level amateur soccer my body has been beat up pretty good. I had shoulder pain in both shoulders for some time and found some relief from PT but not as much as I would have liked. Since coming to Select Pain Care both shoulders are feeling great! It's been a great experience. Thanks|Select Pain is an outstanding clinic.   I'm an active person (hockey, cycling, running, gym, etc.) I started developing lingering knee pain that persistently worsened.  It got to the point where I thought I wouldn't be able to do all the activities the enjoyed.  I thought I was just getting old and that's what happens.  So, I went in and had the consultation with Dr. Scott.  I'm not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical, but was at the point I was willing to try anything.  I started noticing the improvement immediately.  He was honest and said it would take multiple seasons to fully fix the issue and symptoms could return because of my active lifestyle. It took time, but I continued to see improvement and today I'm moving better than I was prior to when the pain started.  I'm going to continue to do my part and stick with exercises Dr. Scott showed me.  I'm writing this to say thanks to Dr. Scott and his staff for their expertise and effort. Great work!|Scott and Team are truly amazing at what they do! He is able to pinpoint the nerves that need attention based on where I'm having pain & I've seen so much improvement. Very happy I was recommended here - didn't think it was possible to not have pain, but they are showing me it is possible!|Strongest recommendation for Dr. Scott and Select Pain Care - this place truly is the answer to all your pain issues and it's shocking that this type of health solution is not more widely known or available.  Dare I say, magical?! I had a lingering running injury that extended from my glute through entire leg that rest, stretching, massage, balls, rollers, therra gun, you name did not fix.  Within ONE MONTH, JUST ONE MONTH, I was pain free.  Not only am I pain free, but Dr. Scott educates you on your injury to help with prevention.  This place and the people treat you with respect, care and dignity - do yourself a favor and truly get cured without endless doctor fees and prescriptions.|Would give 10 stars if I could!  Dr. Scott and his team worked around my schedule to make appointments easy and convenient for me.
Dr. Scott diagnosed and provided the first treatment for my pain in my right arm right away.  Appointments always started on time and were informative, I appreciated the fact that he explained what was happening, and why he was doing the things he was doing.
Select Pain Care is an excellent place to get treatment for pain.

I have been a patient three times now.  When I came in previously for knee and left arm pain, Dr. Scott recommended exercises to prevent future injuries/adhesion, and sure enough years later no new issues in those spots!

Thank you Dr. Scott and team!|Dr. Scott and his whole staff are truly lifesavers. I have dealt with lower back/sacrum/hip pain for over 5 year resulting from a work out injury and have honestly tried everything from PT, Dry Needling, Chiro, massage and so on to only have temporary relief. After one month the pinching that I have struggled with for years went away (I was shook...) and I am forever grateful. I have also worked with Dr Chris and both docs are truly the
real deal and actually listen to you. I was also amazed at how the initial consultation was a hour and everything was so thorough. Ketsy, Calliva and Haley are also so sweet and wonderful. Highly recommend the Select Team to everyone I know looking to get pain relief!|Before seeing Dr. Scott I was laying on the floor each night with nerve pain and getting zero sleep. I tried Accupuncture, physical therapy, dry needling and more with no help. Dr. Scott helped me sleep again leading up to a back surgery.

I now can sleep through the night and they are helping me recover from my ALIF surgery.

No one else Ian doing what they are in the Milwaukee area and I'm glad I found them.

After being a patient with Lawal for 4 years- I am tired of feeling unheard. After being advised to hold off scheduling the injection, and advised to go into the ER- I did just that.

I never refused the given date, but instead wanted both an in-clinic visit scheduled along with the existing ESI INJ. Appt. Called today to find out I wasn't even on the books for a back shot.

Also my mother did not ask for a TOC from caitlin, caitlin said she put a TOC and referral from my mother to igwe. just can't understand why the whole focus is on caitlins previous care of my mother and the things my mother didnt do years ago during a time of grieving the loss of her husband ( my dad) and to just focus on the present?|The reception team are all racist!!

They prescribed high doses of ibuprofen for me, which caused me side effects of my heart. Come to find out that due to my 2 heart conditions, I am not supposed to take NSAIDs. They weren't helping either.

And then the withdrawals from your previous medication that they won't prescribe for you that your using for pain is enough to make you go to the emergency room for.

It even sure there was one there. I was seen twice by the worst nurse Practitioner I've ever met in my 57 yrs in this planet. Her judgemental attitude towards me was very off putting. This person continues lyrics tried to sell me on surgery which is; as I had told her over n over, not an option for me at this time. And then after telling me in the most entitled and condescending way possible they were not going to prescribe any opioid and that there's nothing they will do for me I walked out. The judgmental attitude is my reason why I left. Beware if you need help this place is not the place to go. If ya want your insurance to get billed for redundant BS then sure this is yer place. I highly recommend you find another place for pain management.|Where to begin this nightmare. My last 2 visits ended in tears because I have never been more frustrated and more upset at the lack of empathy and compassion from a healthcare provider in my life. I have had severe debilitating back pain for 5 months. It has clearly interfered with all daily activities and work. I was first prescribed a steroid pack and lyrica (a nerve pain pill) when these didn't work I called the office sobbing in pain. I was told there was absolutely nothing they could do until I came in for a follow up- which the earliest appointment was a month away. In order to do ANYTHING to help control the pain while I waited 30 days I took large amounts of OTC pain med (Tylenol, Advil, aleve etc) it was my only option. When I had my follow up I was honest and told them how much OTC pain meds I was taking, hoping to convey exactly how much pain I was in because I was repeatedly getting the feeling they did not believe me. Amy gave me a stern lecture about it and when I asked what was I supposed to do, that's when she said ""you should have called"" WHICH I DID. But as I tried to tell her that, she cut me off and did not allow me to speak. It took over a month to get my MRI results. Which were available in 6 days through my portal. At my next visit, in severe pain, Amy scolded me and told me to ""sit up straight"" twice when I could barely manage the pain from sitting and that was the only way it felt semi ok.  Who says that to someone in severe pain? She then took me off the pain reliever that was helping- due to high blood pressure- spoiler alert, my blood pressure was high because of extreme pain for 5 months and also anger and frustration dealing with their office (it was normal and documented at my annual visit with my PCP a week prior to this and I have an at-home cuff to monitor), so she put me on a different pain reliever. The new one gave me extreme headaches and when I consulted with a second opinion they were shocked I was placed on the new medication because it had even HIGHER amounts of cardiac side effects than the first medication. In your appointment there is no room or safe space for you to communicate your questions or concerns. If you have a differing opinion or challenging questions you are met with a higher-than-thou attitude and it becomes incredibly awkward. As soon as I mentioned I was getting a second opinion and would do some research, the vibe changed real real fast. Do yourself a favor and seek care elsewhere.|I started seeing Amy Maass to manage my pain care, she had prescribed me Belbuca without telling me about the warning for tooth decay. I had a med check and was going to be bringing the medication with me to be disposed of. I have several health issues and cannot drive. I forgot to bring the medication and was told if I do not get it there in the next 2 hours (when they close) that my account would be permanently flagged, I would not ever get opioids or controlled substances again, and if it wasn't there by Thursday, they would file a police report. My extreme frustration was met with anger from Dr. Maass when I stated ""I don't understand how doctors have all this wiggle room, but patients who have documented health conditions that even cause memory problems, aren't given the same understanding"" she yelled ""don't you group me in with those doctors when I've been trying to help you!"" Not realizing she is just another one of those legal drug dealers that wanted to push opioids that I quit taking because of the side effects. She is another reason patients are slowed down from receiving proper health care.|Every one has their own story as to what brings you looking for a place to go when you are suffering with chronic pain. First and foremost, you are exhausted emotionally and physically from the pain. Secondly, you're probably just exhausted from not being believed your pain is that real it has depleted who you once were and you just want a little bit of ""normalcy"" to feel anything but just pain your in day to day. I have been through all the ups and downs from before Dr Sohn started the clinic through the growing pains as Wisconsin Spine and Pain started up. I know everyone will have different experiences but I can only elude to mine. I have never felt like I have been treated like I didn't matter or at the same time like I was lumped together in a pool of ""just another chronic pain patient looking for medication"".. I have seen many doctors with all I have been through and Dr Sohn is one of the kindest at the same time most attentive of them all. Remember you go into a dr visit listing your symptoms but also listening to what the physician has too say in options too help. Dr Sohn has done that vehemently! But, I continue to be more and more blessed that I get too see and be a patient of Amy Maass his PA who has continuously listened too me and help suggest procedures to help calm down my pain and symptoms! She has been an emotional boost in listening and believing me and more so believing in me to help continue to help myself stay the best course I can to living as full of life that my body allows. And her demeanor and positivity only bolsters my mental health all the more as well. I am honest with them and they are honest with me and it creates a wonderful relationship between any Dr. and patient. The whole staff in Appleton has been kind and considerate. There is a branch in Green Bay but since the one has opened in Appleton I prefer to stay closer to home. Yes, it has been a long road to find a the drs I could trust and believe are truly there to really help me and put me and my health first and foremost- again with kindness and compassion from all the staff.|Amy and staff are very professional and like to have fun while working.|Visiting Wisconsin spine and pain yesterday was like reading the glorified brochure to Disneyland and ending up at the Schitts Creak Motel, I planned my trip with filling out all the forms beforehand on line and was extremely accurate, I had hopes of lowering my daily pain first and foremost and working on measures to help in the future, the moment I mentioned pain medicine the conversation changed to ""we use interventional pain care"" and will not prescribe opioids, so after all the time I wasted getting the referral, filling out all the paperwork and having hopes to live a better quality of life without pain were dashed like a dirty smelly pool at a dirty window operation, I was extremely disappointed but then realized that this will be another operation that will go bankrupt with misrepresentation and double billings in a blink of an eye, I would stay away if given the choice.|The staff is what makes it so wonderful for me|",2025-02-17|2024-09-04|2024-04-07|2024-01-25|2025-02-07|2023-11-10|2024-02-08|2023-11-30,1|1|1|5|5|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ2SjZWZG3A4gR-CNhKdDGeEI,8

I've been a patient for nearly 7 years. I came in in May as the recent treatment didn't work and I had to quit my job as I was not physically capable from the pain. It wasn't until August (no pain management in the meantime) that NP Mary discussed a Facet injection. Her inaccurate notes that omitted the fact the recent procedure was ineffective caused my insurance to deny the injection.

I made a follow up with Scarlett and discussed my concerns about inaccurate notes. He assured me that she's since retired and there was no further cause for concern. He then agreed to order an epidural for my back. During our discussion, I brought up that I like aqua classes at the YMCA but couldn't afford a membership. He asked if I wanted a referral to aqua therapy also. I agreed. I specifically asked if I needed to contact Wisconsin Spine and Pain about the epidural, he said no. They would call me within a week.

5 weeks later, no call. I contact the nurse line, and he didn't even put the discussion about the epidural in our notes!! I told the nurse I needed to speak with Scarlett. There was no call back, but the director, Ruth called me to tell me that Scarlett was discharging me as a patient because of this. She refused to take my complaint and refused to provide her email so I may file my complaint with her. Additionally, she said I stated that I would be filing a complaint against Scarlett's license. I told that was untrue and I had a recording of the conversation to prove it. The letter I received discharging me as a patient listed my need for recording as the reason for the break.

THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

I guess he doesn't want to be held accountable for medical negligence. I'm now definitely going to file a formal complaint to the board after this action. There's much more, but it would be a lot to quite.|Dr. Scarlett and his staff are extremely knowledgeable with up to date procedures to help relieve pain.

He did listen to me on some of what I said but I feel like the rest of it he didn't listen to me very well at all what I wanted I was  very disappointed.

):   ):

He wasn't  that open to talk. Not easy talk too.  He needs to learn to be more open to his patients and  what different every patients  out wants wants. What best for them.  I feel like for the most part that appointment was not worth my time only a few minutes was   time worthy my time. My appointment was at 8:15 and he didn't come back to like 8:45.  He was late coming in I didn't appreciate that at all.  I think I was the first one on the list.

I think he just needs to understand that most of his patients see him because they have been having chronic and severe pains and also after they have exhausted other options. I really appreciate how he made sure I understood  the proposed treatment. It's sensitive ... just be empathetic and scientific at the same time and don't jump into conclusion about the patient's personality when the treatment doesn't work.|Like another reviewer said, very respectful and caring doctor.

I started treatment in June and finished in November.

They went about their business very professionally and answered all my questions about the multiple steps that they were going through. I'd had previous experience doing stem cells for my knee at Mayo Clinic 8 years ago and was very satisfied with the result back then. So I had much insight as to what was needed to do the job properly. This program goes well beyond what Mayo did back then but still retained the basic elements of what was needed. It showed be the advances that have been made in 8 years. I'm extremely satisfied that I selected QC Kenetix for this procedure on my painful hip. This approach makes so much more sense than cortisone shots and eventual surgical replacement.  My knee is still doing fine.|Very knowledgeable and caring staff.

Five Stars!!!!!!!|Dr. Jackson and the Midwest Pain team do a great job and make you feel extremely comfortable.  Dr. Jackson is great at what he does and his insight and vision really help with chronic pain!  Midwest Pain Solutions is the best around, hands down!|Dr Jackson and his team are always great.

The PT and medications helped but I never got back to my pre crash daily functioning. After hearing good reviews from some friends I decided to give Midwest Pain Solutions a try. Dr. Jackson set me up with a great treatment plan and I have increased my functioning and decreased my overall daily pain. You can tell Dr. Jackson and his staff actually care about you as a person, not just another patient. The advanced healing lasers he uses is what sets this clinic apart from the others. It's awesome to have this advanced technology in Green Bay! I would definitely recommend this clinic to friends and family.|Love this place!  Dr Jackson worked out my issues with a frozen shoulder that I had tried many things over a year to fix. After a few months working with him he had it back to normal. I continue to see him for chiropractic maintenance and I feel great. Would highly recommend. In addition to being a great and effective doctor he is also a really nice guy with a great staff.|I have had issues with lower back pain for years and numbness in my toes for the past few years. After trying a number of treatments and nothing helping I decided to talk to Dr. Jackson at Midwest Pain Solutions, I am amazed at how the combination of adjustments and laser therapy has improved my back pain and the numbness in my toes. Dr Jackson and his staff are very caring and friendly  and always have a smile on their faces. I would refer any of my family and friends to Midwest Pain Solutions.|2 months ago after giving up hope that anyone could help me, I called Midwest Pain Solutions.  After 1 hour of talking with Dr Jackson Draeger he knew exactly what was going on and told me ""I can help you with that!""  Best decision I ever made!!!

I cant thank them enough for what they are doing for me!|Highly recommend Dr Jackson, had pain in my feet for years, after just a few visits my feet feel great.

She refused me simple effective relief through nerve blocks for 12 years because I mistakenly trusted her. Subsequent pain clinic doctors upon hearing her treatment of me would shake their heads, gave me nerve blocks, and put me on the road to recovery. But if a patient is female Bratanow can even overprescribe. I saw this myself in the reception room. Secondly, she left me in an exam room for 90 minutes before coming in with another patient. She has a nice smile, but it is a put on. She screwed me out of 12 years of my life. BEWARE!|Always ran out of medication because no one ever was in the office to approve refills. Consistently ran 1-2 hrs late for appointments, often waiting there long enough to have to cancel and reschedule. During a scheduled procedure that was scheduled for my neck, she tried to inject my lower back. She didn't know what I was even there for. After telling a friend of this (she is an x-ray tech who has worked in the room with Dr. Bratanow), she informed me that when the doctor gives injections, she orders general anesthesia so that you don't know she is only injecting you just underneath the skin, not actually hitting where the affected nerves are so you need to have procedures/injections more often.|I cannot say enough good things about this doctor. She was assigned to me while I was in the hospital for my Crohn's disease. She had successfully been able to find some good alternatives to the traditional opioids that typically would cause constipation, which is not good for someone with stomach issues like me. She is very smart, and will be starting to work with her to manage my migraines, as well.

The largest thing that was important was the time she spent with me, explaining each of the medicines, as well as her wonderful bedside manner. She really truly cared for me while there, and did what she could to manage my pain... which is wonderful to feel validated when you don't feel well at all. I would recommend her in a heartbeat!|If you want and have to get off opiates she cares and can make it happen !! I'm soon to be one of them, after 12 yrs for back pain were going to make it happen in around 7 months !!!|No one answers the office phone and they don't call you back.

On 11/5 I had the Milds procedure. Wow. Day 1 I was able to walk up the stairs without pain.
Dr. Philip, Kay and entire staff at both locations are very compassionate and professional. They understand. Thank you|Dr. Phillip, Kay and the rest of the support staff at Midwest Sport & Spine does an excellent job of listening to my concerns and recommending treatment options.  Highly recommended!|I have bursitis in my left hip which would not respond to stretching, OTC pain relievers, or topical treatments.  It became aggravating and disruptive enough that I brought it up to my primary care doctor who in turn referred me to Dr Philip. I was evaluated and scheduled for a cortisone injection which has provided the relief I was seeking.  I am able to sleep on my left side without discomfort and am walking virtually pain free.  The minor aches and pains I still have are not in my hip but are likely attributable to the change in my gait from when my hip was the issue.  I expect them to resolve in time now, or maybe not since I'm 73 and if I don't wake up with something aching I probably died. In any event I was very pleased with every aspect of my experience with Dr Philip and gladly recommend him as a pain management specialist.|Dr.Philip and team will work with you to heal/ relieve pain with skill and safety. They are personable and friendly,  can't ask for more!|Dr. Phillips is amazing! He always takes the time to talk with me about my chronic pain and my overall care plan.

My Dr. retired and I was transferred to Dr. Fault. First visit, he was undoing my long term controlled care from my older Dr. because he didn't approve of the meds I've been on for a decade. He wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. It put my MS into chaos. He tortured me for 5 years. He disregarded my neurologist when she tried to explain to him what his actions were doing to my body. I was seeing his PA monthly, as he wouldn't see me personally. When the PA, told me to make an appt with him about my issues, he would have his receptionist call a couple days before and ask what the nature of my appt would be. Then he would ultimately cancel the appt. He did this several time. Even his PA would apologize. Just a coward of a man.

I finally switched providers and found another pain Dr. I've been with him 2 years now and I'm back on track.

The clinic I go to now has inherited a lot of Dr. Faull patients that he did the same thing too. I won't repeat what those Dr's say about Dr. Faull but they knew exactly what he is about and what he was doing. I'm a very hard case and he didn't want to deal with me. That was obvious. He should've just said that instead of torturing me to leave. He's just a very rude man.

I have nothing good to say about him. He shouldn't be working in this area of medicine period.|Dr Faull is an exceptional doctor. Where other doctors were perfectly willing to just leave me in horrific pain in both knees, barely able to walk and sinking rapidly into despair, Dr Faull proposed a plan. Nerve blocks to see if they help and if they do then do a nerve ablation. Now I will be the first to admit that I am afraid of needles and unknown procedures, always envisioning a painful experience. Now some very busy specialists of his caliber have little to no patience when it comes to such nervous Nellie patient's. Dr. Faull was most compassionate and gracious. He knew I was ready to jump off that table and run. His two lovely assistants who helped with the procedure were equally compassionate. Those young professionals learned that skill set from someone and I'm going to guess it was Dr. faull. What an amazing team. The nerve blocks gave me sweet relief for a couple of weeks from a devastating pain. I now look forward to the ablations and a longer period of pain relief from this pain. Dr. Faull is the Best of the Best. I am ever grateful to him for his expertise.|I've seen Dr. Faull several times and have a good sense of his skills. Nearly all my experiences have been negative. Treating my spinal issues, he injected an epidural, which failed. He next proposed the very same injection, which SSM rejected because he had done it before with poor results.

I most recently saw Dr. Faull for a morphine injection, first calling attention to my MyChart records, which lists morphine as a problem for me. Furthermore he failed to assure me that a new lower dosage of morphine would not cause the same problem as I had experienced the first time.

Finally, he ignored or failed to read my Med list to see that I take ambien at bedtime. Morphine reacts negatively with Ambien - taking both drugs can be a dangerous combination. Dr. Faull must not have checked my med list.

To sum up, in my case, Dr.Faull ignored both my medical history as well as his own treatment records, and he is unfamiliar with the research literature on dangerous drug Interactions.

Dr. Faull can be rude. When I flinched and said Ouch during an injection, he told me the problem was my attitude!

I'm moving on to a new doctor.|Caring, compassionate, knowledgeable, thorough are all qualities of Dr. Thomas Faull that I have experienced first hand. He is always thorough and compassionate with me. I never leave an appointment with him with a single question, or with any of my concerns unanswered. He looks for solutions and doesn't offer BS. He's simply one of the best physicians that I have ever had, bar none. I highly recommend Dr. Faull for finding answers and solutions to pain issues.|I want to thank Dr. Faull for everything he has done for me.  I went to him when I was in so much pain from rear end car accidents.  He worked with me every step of the way to finally become almost pain free.  The last Mild procedure was the ticket followed up by PT.  He listens and explains things so I could understand and never once did he ever make me feel like I was crazy and the pain was in my head!  You gave me back my life I cannot thank you enough.|dr faull was wonderful helping me with neuropathy caused by a neuro-stimulator implant at another healthcare provider. i would highy recommend him.||",2024-05-01|2022-11-03|2019-05-26|2018-10-17|2021-08-18|2022-10-12|2021-05-18|2020-10-14,1|5|1|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJLSukVdSsB4gRjBy2sRKohSA,8

Finally an orthopedic surgeon told me there was nothing structurally wrong with my knee and recommended I try alternative medicine.   That same day, I made an appointment with  Dr. Zhou.  After the third appointment I noticed a great deal of relief.  The inflamation was greatly reduced and I could walk with no pain.  I am currently in Physical Therapy  and can bend my knee 115 degrees.  I have no pain and for the first time in almost a year, I have hope for a normal future!  My only regret is that I didn't go see Dr. Zhou sooner.|Dr Zhou has been my saving grace for years. He has fixed so many things on me that most doctors have either tried to medicate away or had wanted to do surgery on. From what felt like lightning, tingling, and numbness in my arms and hands, to when I lost the ability to lift my arms from shoulder pain, and then a bacteria that messed up my guts from overseas, he has fixed it all. Most recently, it feels like he saved my life and my sanity and gave me another chance to live and function again. I was in a car accident that gave me such a bad concussion that it affected my speech, vision, and hearing, made my tinnitus worse, and I could barely be touched without pain. It caused a deep depression and anxiety, severe nausea, and memory issues, and left me with problems being able to comprehend and utilize information I was reading or hearing. I have been seeing Dr Zhou for a few weeks now and I really wish I could have made it to see him sooner, I can only imagine how much better I could have been feeling but I am so glad I started seeing him when I did, because my reading, speaking and thinking is so much better already, my body doesn't hurt no where near as bad anymore, everything just feels so much better!

Just today I told him I had a sharp pinch in my back when I would bend down or bend backwards. While I was standing he had poked one spot and said okay bend, and it was unbelievable the pain was gone just like that. He really is a gifted and talented man. If you've ever been on the fence about acupuncture or want to give it a shot Dr zhou is your man.|Dr Zhou has helped me and my family tremendously.

They were pushy when it came to treatment and only gave one treatment option. The spinal stimulator may work for some but not all. We were never given any other options or any other treatments.

We told her we would go to my husbands own mental health provider. Now this company wont stop hounding me. I have told them in text and over the phone that we would not be using them.

He refused to listen to my concerns and offer alternatives.

I have never had a stimulator.

It's been 4 months since the first one and 2 1/2 months since the second and I'm fishing, golfing, climbing ladders, and getting a start on all my projects I've been putting off.
Every step of the process was easy from scheduling appointments to the physical therapy after surgery.
I saw Luke Pan for my PT. He is an amazing therapist that knows exactly how to motivate and help you to get the best possible results.
I will recommend the team I had to anyone who is considering knee replacement surgery.|Hip replacement by Dr Liebelt and his team.

I was scheduled for a MRI after seeing him  hee proceeded to call the same day with results and options. Because I had suffered this injury last year, I had already done physical therapy and immobilization so the next logical step was surgery.
My expectations day of surgery were beyond any scope that I ever experienced before!
Dr Kozanek took  the time, before surgery, to explain to me what he was going to do and where the incision was going to be, what to expect, etc.
I have never been more pleased with a doctor and his team!
I will tell everyone I know they need to see him and his team. Thank you so much all of you!!|I was hesitant to go forward with my hip surgery in March 2024, but it was long overdue. From my initial contact with Dr. Liebelt and his staff, it has been a very positive experience. Even when the follow up didn't go as planned, Dr. Liebelt and team rectified it quickly!  I would not hesitate to recommend this team. The medical assistants, nurses, PA's, surgical teams and Dr. Liebelt all made me feel comfortable and continue to follow up. I am excited to be able to all things I couldn't do before!|I had a total left hip replacement three weeks ago by Dr. David Liebelt. For 22 years I walked with a 5/8 inch shoe lift on my left shoe. Dr. Liebelt stretched my leg out so I no longer need a lift on my shoe. For 22 years I walked in pain. Today, Thank's to Dr. Liebelt and his staff I no longer have that horrible pain.
