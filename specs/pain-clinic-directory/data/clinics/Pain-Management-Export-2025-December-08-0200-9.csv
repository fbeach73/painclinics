Very Respectfully,
Mobeen|If you're someone who has suffered from chronic pain and have felt dismissed by previous physicians, look no further than Dr. Kiefer

I saw Dr. Kiefer for a consult before he will perform a procedure. As someone who has had chronic pain for the last 10 years, I've seen A LOT of doctors over the years.

Dr. Kiefer stands out because:
1) HE TRULY LISTENS TO HIS PATIENTS AND CONCERNS! Also, he has great bedside manner overall

2) He is super knowledgeable and clearly continues research/learn about conditions to ensure that he can provide the best treatment to his patients. He clearly goes above and beyond by doing additional research on existing diseases/conditions as well as studying new conditions.

3) he doesn't rush his patients and makes sure to ask all of the pertinent questions to make sure you receive the best care possible

Also, the office staff is super responsive, organized, and helpful. When working with patients who are suffering from chronic pain, it takes extra patience and empathy. They carry themselves with passion and grace.

Excited to have found Dr. Kiefer and I wish I had sooner|Dr. Tesfayohannes is an excellent person.My experience with him has been great.  He is very attentive to my needs and has relieved me from the awful pain I experienced; on many occasions.
He is also a great surgeon as is Dr. Kiefer. The best doctors I have ever had.|Dr. Kiefer is genuinely a life changing doctor. I have a fairly rare disease and it's usually very difficult to find a doctor who understands my body and the way pain, and medications, affect me. But Dr. Kiefer is very knowledgeable about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and has experience working with other patients with the disease, so he didn't have any issue in that regard. Above all else, possibly more importantly than his knowledge and experience, he is incredibly empathetic. He listens to me when I state my concerns, goals, and symptoms-- and we have an ongoing dialogue that makes me feel heard and respected. He has helped me immensely and thanks to him I no longer wake up every day in 8/10 pain.|I had a acute problem with sciatica.  I went to see Dr. Net and Kiefer and they were very professional and caring.

He also told me ""I don't do MyChart and don't give out my phone number,"" when asked the best way to get him to communicate with me between appointments or when needing him to appeal using the peer to peer method with my insurance. He is condescending and uncaring. The nurse even told me to ""run away. This is how he treats his patients."" No one returns phone calls. Ever. I'm filing a formal complaint with the hospital, but needed to put this here too. Nursing staff is phenomenal. Front desk staff is a solid 3/10. And Cohen is reprehensible. Stay away.|It's Mighty Sad to see that what was once a very excellent inpatient Pain Management Treatment Program at Hopkins is no longer so highly regarded.  When  I was there  years ago, the emphasis was on Pain Management and  Severe Pain Reduction. Now  it's  possible that the program has been largely supplanted by , or hijacked by, Psychiatrists and psychiatric residents
which are no substitute for the particular expertise of  Physiatrists, Osteopathic Physicians and Anesthesiologists in.a clinical setting aiming to improve lives of pain sufferers.                   "" Multidisciplinary "" Medical teams sound and often are very impressive and helpful ; that is , if indeed they produce good outcomes. But if , for example  , an
"" addiction "" preoccupation overtakes a focus on Safe Lasting Relief in a program like this , patients will surely continue to Suffer.|Dr. Ooi and Dr. Limerick were both communicative and kind. I have found relief from the medication and nerve block I was given. They have been very empathetic and I'm glad to have doctors who care about my experience.|I've been suffering with chronic pain in my buttocks right hip and thigh for over 5 yrs. I found Dr. Sivanesan and Dr. Ooi who specializes in Arachnoiditis. Since seeing them I have been treated w more aggressive nerve medication, muscle relaxants and now after my trial w a Spinal Cord Stimulator which improved my symptoms a lot, I am going to have the SCS permanently installed. The whole team at this center is and has been very helpful at a desperate time.|Literally moved here from out of state and been trying to get a appointment to see a Dr and after months of back and forth about my records I still haven't heard from anybody just to see a Dr. Been on Pain Management for nearly all my life and this is the worst patient relations I have ever been through they simply do not care..I would definitely choose wisely next time don't bother with this department|I dont even want to give one start but that is the only option. I saw a pain doctor 2x. He was great by the way. Sat in the office for 2 hours ans waited for my appointment because they were running behind. He prescribed me meds and ordered a pain procedure for me. They told me someone would call to schedule. Nobody called and you can't get ahold of anyone from the office because there is no direct number. Left about 10 messages and no response. My medication is still sitting at the pharmacy because it requires a pre authorization. What a joke!|I feel this clinic and Dr. Schechter saved my life.  I fell down 18 stairs and severely broke my arm.   I had two surgeries was in the hospital 11 days.  I couldn't make progress in physical therapy because I was afraid to let anyone touch my arm; in fact I was afraid of many things after that fall.  Dr Schechter was so kind to me and made sure I had the serious pain meds I needed to get through a year of PT.   I can't say enough about this center.|Promotional materials for Johns Hopkins Pain Treatment Program (PTP) cheerily assert that ""story matters!"" This implies that the service user's story, their lived experience, matters to the clinicians and plays a significant role in treatment. However, I discovered the treatment plan is based on the psychiatrist's story about my story, which has virtually no similarity. Dr. Glenn Jordan Treisman's personal experience and psychiatric training reduced my story to one about broken brain chemicals disconnected from a living, breathing human being. Such dehumanization generates the contempt from which cruelty is made and abuse is perpetrated.

The Hopkins pain clinic provided me with an assessment that erased my life story and replaced it with items cherry-picked to support a preconceived conclusion so ill-fitting that my therapist said ""Well, at least they got your name right."" My psychologist noted the document is ""blaming you in a sense for where you are, that you haven't done the right thing."" Ironically, the document simultaneously says I've done so much of the right things for myself that Hopkins can't offer better.

Hopkins presents the clinic as cutting edge but it just pushes the same old stuff. It proposes to treat me through the same modality that deeply harmed me already, much more of it, for a longer period of time and more intensely.

The density of the contempt markers in the report confirms that to trust my care to anyone associated with the production of this document would be to knowingly put me in the very power dynamic that repeatedly caused me deep and lasting harm. The Hopkins pain clinic would be the very kind of closed system and power differential that allows and protects the type of obliteratingly heinous abuse to which I have been subjected repeatedly since birth, predominantly by those in charge of my welfare.

Fortunately, I have studied the neurobiology of trauma and recovery for over 9 years and was able to discern the truth about the Hopkins pain clinic: it's just another pathologizing, degrading, and reductionist psychiatric facility that often causes trauma survivors more harm. I chose to continue my neuroscience-based somatically-oriented dynamic healing framework, which has saved my life against a ""healthcare"" system so ignorant that it causes further trauma and even kills. #TraumaAwareAmerica",2024-05-13|2024-06-09|2024-07-24|2024-07-11|2024-09-16|2023-11-03|2023-11-02|2023-10-15,1|2|5|5|1|1|5|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Are you excepting new patients?

""A pain management specialist is a physician with advanced knowledge and training in diagnosing and treating pain. These doctors do not come from one particular discipline, but rather use their respective backgrounds to contribute a varied approach to the field of pain management. These specialists use their different skills and training in pain management to treat pain stemming from different causes - whether it's neuropathic pain or headache, or the result of injury, a surgical procedure, cancer or another illness. Pain management specialists are primarily trained as anesthesiologists, physiatrists, interventional radiologists, neurologists, osteopaths, or primary care physicians"".|Dr sayeed truly cares about his patients.

Care has gone from good in the beginning - I followed a PA from Rockville to Germantown. She was wonderful. She has since moved on. About a year ago, they merged all of the patients from Rockville into Germantown. They only had one PA to cover 100% of prescriptions. They couldn't see you every 4 weeks because there were too many patients. They either gave you a hard time and called in a bridge or you had to keep calling day after day and pray you could get in before your medication ran out. I expressed my disappointment earlier this month when I was told again my appointment would be 6 weeks out. They seemingly paid me back by intentionally not getting prior authorization for a medication I notified the office was required a month and a half ago. Bottom line: they left me hanging, medication ran out. I didn't receive it until it was a week past due! I tried to work with the office. They couldn't have been nastier. They refused to take down the information my insurance said was required. They wouldn't even take the number I had. I was discharged from the hospital in extreme pain and they made sure that I would suffer when I couldn't get my medication. Horrible place.|My wife is coming from a long distance to seek help from an ailing back and knee that gives her pain every day. Came to the place on time and had to wait for the workers to come to work. Not a good look when a patient with chronic back and knee pain has to wait for the workers to come to work.|I tried to call to alert the provider of the cvs pharmacy's several attempts to reach him to change my prescription without success. I tried several times before getting someone to answer the phone.
The lady receptionist who answered the call was exceptionally rude. She didn't even wanted to listen to what I was saying. Some of us have worked in hospitals before and we see such behaviors as very abhorrent.
Continuous staff training at this facility is absolutely needed.|Krupa shah has exceptional bedside manner. I had a gunshot wound with tons of shrapnel. It always hurts in many ways. Krupa understood it and helped me out the best she can. Krupa is a great practitioner. She is by the book but also very caring towards patients' needs. Thank you Krupa for being a great practitioner with compassion and empathy. Means the world when you're dealing with pain management. Thank you|We patients understand the seriousness in taking narcotic drugs and the political pressures that exist politically. After going over the handlebars of my bike in 2001, I've been in very bad pain (even on 60mg of morphine 2/day). Twice, two years ago, I was unable to locate my medication due to a national shortage. The pain was horrendous and I very seriously considered suicide. Happily, I was finally able to locate some locally. (But no one cares if a patient can't get it, only if he has too much. The amount of pain I have is not easily described to those who don't have it.
When I worked at NIH, I talked to the director of the Pain and Palliative Care Department. I asked him one day how people handled chronic pain in the frontier era (people fall off horses, etc.). He looked me square in the eye, and without saying a word, he extended the thumb and small finger of his right hand, tilted it and flipped it, as though drinking a bottle of booze. Then using the same hand, he turned it into a pistol, held it at the side of his head, his thumb as though cocked, and dropped it as if it were a hammer. He didn't need to say a word. Booze or suicide.|Spine center is a great patient experience. They care and ensure you are taken care of, understand everything that is discussed and let you know what things actually mean. I've been a patient since 2010 and love the Germantown office. Ayanna is the Best manager ever and Krupa is a joy! Dr. Sood is very caring and his procedures provide what relief I can get.|Emma was a great receptionist and the main reason I continued to go there. Now she's gone and some of the others are surly and one told me I couldn't combine a refill appointment with a procedure even though I had done it before because ""they would lose money."" Spine and Pain is part of a large organization and seem to be unable to make their own decisions. Example is that the FDA has said that video appointments for prescription refills are ok even for opioids but the company won't let the office here do that. My health insurance also says it's ok. On another note the PA's have been nice especially Shah.|Spine and Pain center does a wonderful job in dealing with my disk problem.

I was so sad when he left I think I even cried.. lol but meeting Dr,Mosuro made me feel reassured that I would be taken care of. The office staff and himself are amazing. He has been so attentive as well as caring for my condition. He has gone above and beyond. I would recommend NSPC and Dr,Mosuro anyday.|Going to this facility has been a nightmare. My Dr., Dr. Mosuro was unkind, emotionless and barely looked at me. Made me do a $2800 drug test as soon as I got into the door, which was ridiculous. He wouldn't make eye contact, barely listened to me and rushed my appt even though I waited over an hour to be seen. Then after all that, their accounting department submitted my insurance claim wrong and I've had to call them about a dozen times, speaking with disrespectful staff who kept assuring me that they would resubmit the claim, and they didn't. I can't get them to simply do their job! I basically begged, speaker to a supervisor and everything and it still hasn't been done. They're trying to stick me with this $740 bill that my insurance would cover if they could just submit a proper claim. It has been such a stressful situation over a terrible appointment where I got barely any help for my debilitating back pain. This office is terrible, and I highly recommend you take your business elsewhere. They're taking advantage of poor people in desperate need for pain management. I can't speak for the other doctors at the office, but avoid Dr. Mosuro please. And just know that dealing with the accounting department for this office is very stressful. They are incompetent and seem to be purposefully causing stress to their clients and not helping with a very simple matter. I hate to write bad reviews, but this place has caused me so much stress. I want to prevent anyone else from dealing with this situation.

Update: I spoke with the manager of this facility and she was very apologetic, and addressed each of my concerns which I appreciated. The billing issue finally got resolved after I spoke to her. I just hope they make some changes with the billing department and that Dr. Mosuro changes the way he acts towards his patients in the future. Best of luck to this facility and thank you to the manager (can't remember her name unfortunately).|I had my first visit a couple of days ago and I was happy with the experience. The wait isn't long and they like to keep things moving so definitely arrive early to fill out your paperwork. Everyone was nice and friendly. Dr. Nicholson is very knowledgeable and I like that he is going to retrieve all of my medical records and scans before making any decisions. I am scheduled for a block which I expected and the wait for that is very short as well. Appointment times and availability are great which help me out because I need afternoon appointments. Overall so far I have been happy with my experience and would recommend. I'll review again after a few more visits. Thanks for reading!|I was with another pain center who were charging my insurance two times a week for physical therapy while taking $70 a week for co pays.

Because the Doctors, and staff are always kind, respectful, caring, and take time to listen to things of concern. They even laugh with me , show compassion when I am having a downer day!
Sometimes, patients don't want to wear their masks, and they begin to fuss when asked to put on their masks, but, the receptionist is ""very courteous"", she nods hers head with understanding, and allows the patients to vent, and when they have calmed down, they put their masks on, still fussing, but they put it on!

They can no longer keep anyone who is coherent enough and knowledgeable in answering basic questions. Front desk is too busy on the phone to notice you , Once you get to the back by the techs/nurse be ready to be judged and get answers that they don't know or unsure . The doctor is great he knows what he is doing was able to diagnose me and give me a proper treatment plan to avoid surgery and was able to have some injections to help my sciatica pain but his staff is horrible now they don't know anything and are too busy gossiping about others . The only smile and help was Rhonda who has been there for years and Katie who is a great listener , his former PA is no longer there and that was a blow as she knew immediately my needs and care, these new people are so uninterested in the health care , why bother being there to help those in pain if you do not like what you do. Work some where else where you go for a paycheck . the new nurse she is ok but seems to not know what is going on or what procedure is needed next or anything for my transition of care . Only reason to come back is for Dr. Coleman who can fix your back and not have you get surgery he is a life saver 35 years in pain he fixed with needles and didn't shove me off like some other docs with pills and no solution.  otherwise find care elsewhere|This is the worst experience I have ever had and I will not be back. If I could give them 0 I truly would. The lack of customer service, the lack of treatment and the lack of making sure patients don't get the run around is absurd. I recommended people but kindly took the recommendation back. For a person that works in healthcare, this was truly unacceptable.|I will not return because I honestly feel that I was treated unfairly. When a person is really feeling bad and sick, they shouldn't be wrongly judged.|About 2 years ago, I started going there.  At first, I left a positive review, but I changed it, and I want to explain why.  The doctor when I
saw him doing my intake visit really showed concern, after my first visit I was transferred to another staff member.  All of the receptionists were always polite and professional.  The problem that I had was with one of the staff members in the back.   I was prescribed a pain medication that due to the harsh side effects I didn't want to take. The side effect that really concerned me was the possible loss of teeth, even if no dental issues were already present.  Me and that staff member got into a disagreement about me not wanting to take it more than once, which should have been my choice.  She was very disrespectful, and I refused to be treated that way.  The next thing I knew, she accused me of having a dirty drug test, which, when I asked to see my results, I wasn't allowed to.   Yet, on my last day there, she discussed my medical record in front of me with a staff member who was at the front desk as if I wasn't there.  I feel that I was treated unfairly, and I do know that sometimes the test results can be wrong, having a false reading.  They should know that as well.  They actually refused to keep me as a patient due to this.|I've been visiting this exact location for over 10 Yrs and Dr Coleman has always been such an incredible Dr with outstanding bedside manner and if I didn't understand a medical terminology he was always thrilled to explain it so I'd understand. On the months I don't see him I'm happy to say that I see Mrs Justyna Myra and she is such an incredible human being an understanding of all concerns and I'm so impressed by her and how she remembers her patients and the conversations held with her she even recalls several months later and this is the type of relationship I'd like with all of my Drs. Everyone here is so amazing and makes my visit enjoyable|Dr Coleman is the best. Also Justyna Mira is the person I see every month for pain management. She's really good at her job and shows concern for her patients. Rhonda, at the front desk is AWESOME! She recognizes me right away and treats everyone with kindness and respect and compassion. I'm grateful for this entire staff.|This is going to be kind of long, but this needs to be said...

Wait times are atrocious. You're supposed to arrive 15 minutes early or you're considered late and you need to reschedule. Then you're waiting a minimum of an hour past your appt. time to be seen. Can be up to 3 and a half hours. Don't understand how it gets backed up when your only in the actual appt. for up to 1 minute.  Don't know why you're even asked about the state of your health and what you think the treatment regimen is doing for it because you're not listened to. For example, the past year I have voiced my concern that the meds I'm on slightly help, but I feel like maybe a stronger dose or frequency would give me more relief and better quality of life (considering I don't have a good quality of life at all) and their answer is to reduce or completely take away an entire medication. Which then puts me in the hospital for a week due to immense pain from a chronic condition. Then there was a period of time where meds were not being sent to the pharmacy for days after an appt. The most recent appt I had, I had new insurance information. It was never actually put into their system. So the pharmacy kept telling me they were waiting on prior auth. After calling the Dr office multiple times over the course of a week. Someone finally told me that their system showed I had no insurance and I was ""self pay"". I was like no I gave you guys the new info a week ago. After being put on hold 3 times, I was told the front desk does not deal with that. I need to talk to their insurance person. Honestly, what does the front desk even do at this point other than gossip and eat and text on their phones. I will say that the one receptionist, Rhonda, is always very very sweet and nice. She remembers pretty much every patient that walks in. The only positive out of this was the insurance person was very nice and took care of updating my info right away while I was on the phone with her. But even after that, the pharmacy still updated me saying they had yet to get prior auth from the Dr. At that point I was done. I asked the pharmacy if I could just pay for the meds out of pocket. The pharmacy was very helpful and understanding and used good rx to help me gets my meds. I am absolutely going to be looking for another office to start going to. I am so over this office's bs|Went to a previous Dr. and was in pain a little over a year. I went to Dr. Coleman and received 3 injections and it's been two months and NO PAIN! Dr. Coleman is amazing and the nurse that prep you for the procedure is amazing. She made me feel comfortable and was very nice and polite. (She was excellent in giving the IV)

6/152021
Dr. Coleman and his staff are AMAZING!  The first injection I received was 1 1/2 year ago.  NO PAIN. Just received another injection and Dr. Coleman and his staff was just as nice as they were from day one.  They make you feel comfortable and safe.

It was my first time there but the staff I came were warm friendly and caring. And compassionate. I hope they will be able to help me. I will update you as my journey continues.|I had the worst experience in my life I have been with National Spine for several years but now it's a new Doctor at the National Harbor office . I had a knee injection and I couldn't even move my knee or leg I couldn't walk they didn't have a crutch or wheel chair to assist me out the office!!!! I almost had to crawl back to my car. The doctor just set in his office while one of the nurse struggled to get me back to front area.|Staff & Dr's / CRNP are nasty. After months of agonizing pain and not having my pain taken seriously that the Office Manager made fun of me on the phone when I said lack of proper care has caused a dip in my quality of life. I have none, I am in incredible pain everyday and have been since becoming a patient in Jan/Feb 2024. I specifically choose this practice and even asked if they handled pregnant patients was told they did and scheduled with one of their doctors. I underwent IVF in Apr 2024 which I made my Dr well aware at my initial appt. Even he commented on how we should wait til the end of the pregnancy to install a medical device to get my endometriosis pain under control. I was the switched to CRNP Greene who for 4 months blew off my increased pain. Then told me last month the only way he would adjust my regiment was to get a letter from my OB. I did and had to play phone tag between Pain and OB since July 18th. Only to go in for my appt this week and be told that the practice was not going to make any adjustments to my pain regiment. I gave them my new OB's card and was told it was pointless for them to connect at all after telling me 6 weeks prior that was the only way my pain regime would change. Then was finally told that I am their ONLY Pregnant patient and they don't deal with pregnant patients at all. So I could continue to see them for inadequate care that has me using a walker and no safe ability to drive or I could take me somewhere else for care. I also failed my depression screening test in office and the Nurse just had me sign a form saying they asked me the questions. Then the CRNP came in and made not one mention of the depression screening at all which I failed because of part of their inadequate management of my care and pushing off me repeatedly saying the pain is worse. Last I noticed if a patient fails a depression screening then the practice is supposed to provide them with resources for mental health help. Nope just let me walk out despite being in visible pain every appt. Still in agonizing chronic pain which is leading to the depression and they haven't tried to refer me once until admitting this week that I am their only pregnant patient (I am 5 months pregnant) they knew from Feb I was planning on getting pregnant and then I confirmed in May that I was pregnant with twins. Not once did anyone refer me to a doctor that specifically deals with pregnant patients at all. And this last visit they told me find my own damn pain specialist that focuses on that. And don't add in the front desk receptionist trying to add his two cents to mix. Or how the Cigna Nurse Advocate told me that the Pain Office would change my regiment only for that to be a lie when I got there. Most days, I am in so much pain I can't talk and can barely breathe. But yea thanks for giving me the damn run around, not helping me and then making fun of me. All these interactions were with the male staff aside from the nurse last check in.|The entire staff has been courteous , professional, and truly caring and helpful. I would happily recommend them to  my  family and friends.|Not Veteran friendly. I was referred from Veterans Affairs and have been charged for every visit. They wrongly charge my insurance and have sent me to debt collectors three times. I feel used and taken advantage of.|I've had serious back pain since I was a little kid. This is the ONLY place that has found a solution. I cried when after my appointment I have no back pain. I really did not see it coming. I'm extremely grateful to the doctors and support staff that helped me. Everyone is extremely kind and professional. I highly recommend this location and won't trust anyone else with my back going forward. It really feels like a little family. Even the front desk staff remembers your name and asks how you are feeling. You won't regret coming here.|First off I would like to say that Dr. Mangal and his team and the nurses and office staff were awesome! The rest of the experience was horrible. I know as patients it is up to us to do our due diligence when it comes to making sure that everything is properly handled when dealing with medical issues, and I try to stay on top of that but you can only do so much with the information that you are provided. I was not properly informed and as a result of this I now have a huge bill to pay. Dealing with the billing department has been challenging because you can never get direct answers to your questions and if you are lucky to get someone you will be put on hold several times., you can't talk to or email anyone directly regarding claims. It was a hard lesson to learn but I got it and never again.|I must say, that though once in the office everyone is great. National Spine and Pain needs to do something with their call system. The fact that you can't get past the call center to speak to anyone in the office is insane. Not even a hospital ER doctor or a Hospice Nurse can get anyone to assist them with a patient of theirs or get anyone to return any calls. I have had to actually go to the Oxon hill location to get the information that Doctors needed back in July while my family member was in the hospital and they refused to return any of the hospital doctors phone calls. Now here I am facing the same issue, with messages being left to the staff from the Hospice nurse and her affiliates, with no return call and still not being able to obtain the information needed to properly care for my family member while under hospice care. This is insane and absolute cruel to the patients and family members. As if dealing with a family member on hospice isn't enough, now to have to deal with the fact that my family members comfort is being delayed because National Spine and pain won't return any calls or even care enough to provide the information needed!!!",2024-10-15|2024-10-19|2024-08-30|2025-01-14|2024-05-23|2023-10-04|2023-08-24|2023-09-29,5|1|1|5|1|5|1|1,,,"12 p.m.|10 a.m.|11 a.m.",78.8|75.4|74.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|efficient_service,,,,,,,,,,ChIJVa_ahHOwt4kRddVrdCFJ-r4,113

Dr. Jay and those who were with him during the procedure made me feel very comfortable. I'm finally starting to feel some relief now. Thank you all so much for helping me get myself feeling back to normal again. I will definitely continue to see Dr. Jay for this issue when and if it continues to return.

Follow up: Unfortunately the four different injections that I had here never completely worked for me and were a lot of money each time. I finally went two hours up the road to another doctor and his injection worked the very next day and still is working two weeks later.

My surgeon ordered epidural shots in my neck due to extreme pain due to recovering from surgery. I set up the appointment for 8/6/24 and confirmed the injections with total sedation which my pain management doctor also ordered sedation in my chart, so it was in my chart twice. I arrived with my son (have to have a driver) and they said my appointment was cancelled and did not know why and apologized. They said sedation is only on Wednesday's and that the doctor was out the following week and scheduled me 2 weeks out on 8/28/24 and confirmed the injections ordered and  complete sedation. They called me at midday to confirm my injections and full sedation which I confirmed by phone. On my way to the appointment the office called again and asked me to come earlier and again confirmed full sedation with my neck injections. I arrived and checked in and paid for the services. A man came to the lobby and said management did not tell him I was getting full sedation. 20 minutes later they brought me back and put in an IV and then offered light sedation stating the anesthesiologist was no longer at the office. I was not happy but agreed to do the light sedation even though I questioned the dangers of light sedation and not being fully under to not have a medical mistake made with my injections. The manager then came back and said the doctor would NOT do the procedure because I needed full sedation to do the procedure and wanted to re-schedule me for a third time. I do not trust this surgery center and they are grossly incompetent. I missed 3 hours of work for both appointments, costing me and my son's valuable time and money. I told the office to void the transactions (2) and they only voided 1. I called to get the second payment voided and got the run around so now I have to go through my credit card and challenge the charge causing more time and effort on my part. I also experienced being off my pain medications because they had no appointments over the summer two times because providers were on vacation and no appointments were available. They said they would call them in without a visit and then refused to call them in and was off medications for 5 days one time and 7 days the second time. When pharmacies ran out of my prescribed pain medicine it took them 3 days to call in an alternate pain medication. I received good treatment 70% of the time with my pain management doctor and tried to overlook things and be patient. It is alarming to me the complete disregard for my health and healing from surgery to get necessary treatments and having to stop pain medications from a serious neck surgery and could not work or function during these gaps in service for my medication. The surgery center is ""dangerous"" to patient care, and I will be filing a medical complaint for the surgery center doctors for my procedures and lack of procedures due to complete incompetence. It is absolutely baffling to me.|Not only have i been coming here for longer than some of the practitioners, im not receiving management for my pain...after my recent back surgery it turns out that its my hip, I'm bone on bone and 6 weeks out from surgery, and 2 1/2 weeks out from my appt, I'm told we can look into it at my next appt....why are these ppl in pain management if they're not going to control the pain?!?!?!  And don't get me started on that lying arse front desk....this place is going down hill and fast.|Terrible.  Dr forgot to send my meds in, it's been days, I went in for my appt at 830am days ago and they still not calling them in and they said they would.  I'm so upset and I'm in so much pain. Wasted $17 on Uber to be mistreated and still not cared for by their Dr.  What a waste of time, shouldn't have to beg and call multiple times to remind the Dr to do her job. Smh.|I bring my mom here every month....everytime there is an issue with the pharmacy receiving her meds or preauthorization....no one can be reached ...I literally called on the 12/31/24 about an issue with her meds...it took 4 times to call and finally got thru, the lady said she will send the doctor a message....here it is 13 days later the pharmacy still has yet to receive the medication...this time it took me 6 times to get someone on the phone...I explained the situation ..she say okay hold on a sec...1 hour later I hung up......do better|I've been coming here for 8 years and the service with the front staff has deteriorated. Two months ago I show up for my appointment that someone forgot to schedule because I had my form with my injection appointment. I couldn't have the procedure done because insurance needs to give consent. Then today, I find out I don't have an appointment because the provider no longer works there. I feel like the receptionist was stating like it was my fault but I showed my text stating I had an appointment with that individual and time. Then it was stated those texts have nothing to do with the office. I'm not sure whose responsibility it is to notify patients but while I was there, three other patients had an appointment with the same person. How are patients to know a provider is no longer there without notification? I assume the texts I receive are accurate and that's not the case.

This place also cannot keep providers so I think that speaks volumes of the state in which this place has become. There needs to be more support in the front office and providers as well. Management needs to address the issues or perhaps new management is necessary in order to keep patients. I'm considering if I have one more poor experience than I'm gone. I wonder how many others feel the same.|A very very unorganized office.
Appointment was scheduled for 10:30, it is now 1:15 and I still have not been seen.
No one answers the phone.
I wonder how much my time is worth?|The manager at the facility created an unfriendly environment.

To support my statement; I had my first injection yesterday by Dr. P for my excruciating hip pain for months. It's a miracle that I was able to sleep last night feeling only a little bit of discomfort in my left hip. I was able to sleep from 11pm to 11am this morning! Another miracle because I  haven't been able to sleep for months due to the pain.
Dr. P's office staff are highly professional, pleasant and friendly.
I must mention Dr. P's assistant Jay is the world's kindest human being. Yesterday was icy cold in Maryland. After my injection Jay helped me on a wheelchair and transported me from the doctor's office to the elevator and transported me all the way to the parking lot and helped me get into my car. I never met such a kind and considerate person in a doctor's office in my life. To me Jay is my angel. Thank you Dr. P and Jay and everyone in the front office.

We called to schedule a follow up appointment. She called me back to inform me the insurance is inactive. I assured her it is. I work in the medical field and ran this on EPIC that morning and it was active. She insisted she need was going to cancel her appointment until we resolved the issue. I said, well maybe someone needs to call the insurance directly, like we do for our patients to ensure they get efficient care. I even stated I would pay upfront for the cost of this visit. She said I do not work billing, you mothers insurance is inactive I am cancelling her appointment and hung up on me.

Dr. Lee always does such a thorough job on my procedures and also is fun to talk to. Since coming here my pain has only continued to improve.

While the office can get busy at times I would rather drive far to this clinic than go elsewhere where they rush through their patients. I will happily drive further to be seen by attentive and thorough doctors rather than go somewhere close where I am only seen for five minutes.

A lot of free parking and easy to make appointments.|I have been dealing with severe back pain for years and finally found a place that puts my interest's first. Holly always works through my insurance issues. Julie is great for office visits and while it may not always be what I want to hear she does whats right and always has a plan. Dr Q really puts my mind at ease with injections and after my RFAs it is literally night and day pain wise. Highly recommend|I love this place! Very helpful!! Very flexible with appointments!! They slipped me in same day when I had a fall!! Christine and Julie are miracle workers along with doctor Lee!! All thumbs up|Been fighting with insurance companies for years for an mri on my back due to years of chronic back pain getting worse. Finally gets approved.
However I have had nothing but problems with this office. From them waiting until the day before my initial appointment to tell me they didn't receive the referral for my first appointment, to running the wrong insurance not once but twice, to saying they don't have the results of my MRI when I have both the dictated radiologist report and the physical disc with the mri images on it. I just simply no longer trust these people.
Just awful. I suppose there's a reason I take the trip to Boston for specialists and it looks like I'll be going there for my back as well.|I have been going to this office for nerve and disc problems. The procedures I had went very well. Insurance is the biggest problem with adding extra procedures and visits. I really enjoyed the pleasantry of the front office teams on both floors.|Husband seeing after 3 spine surgeries. He's happy so far except they treat every patient as if pill seeker which is not fair. After 3 botched spine surgeries he has permanent pain and nerve damage and they try to take away pain meds right away. We will see if injection actually helps made us wait almost 2 months for that with no compassion for the patient. Not happy with their idea of pain management as it echoes the faltered medical system with patients concerns being dismissed. Me as his wife and advocate as he prefers me to be his voice we have just about lost faith in doctors altogether and at 56 years old have little patience to be treated bad. I am biting my tongue hoping for the best. Always a long wait and not easy access for someone in wheelchair with no automatic doors.
Update...they cut down meds and injections did nothing he is back at square one in pain and unable to move his neck. Waste of time going there thry are just making money off patients. Karma|This doctor's office was recommended due to a poor experience with the reliant medical St Vincent's orthopedic services. The facility is not particularly elaborate and should not be regarded as cutting-edge within the context of medical offices. Honestly, it does not even bear a strong resemblance to a typical doctor's office, nor is there clear signage denoting its status as a medical office from the front of the building. If you can figure out what is the front of the building anyway. Notably, procedures have been relocated to Suite 202 on the second floor. Upon my arrival for a 9:15 a.m. appointment, I encountered a locked door. When I informed the front desk staff, it was revealed that they did not possess the key. This situation was notably disconcerting, especially considering I was scheduled for a spinal injection procedure. The desk person also seemed incredibly new and receiving a billing issue for my insurance I felt asking her would lead to just me getting frustrated as she was not sure what I was supposed to even do to sign in. However, the nurses exhibited kindness and clarity in explaining the proceedings, offering a variety of questions that could be posed. The doctor entered the room and inquired if I had any queries, which I found to be quite helpful. She even indicated the specific region on my lower back where the injection would be administered which I've had issues in the past with doctors being unclear in that regard. Nobody checked if I had a ride as you're not supposed to drive after the procedure that was also a little disconcerting. As I've had similar procedures in the past usually before vitals are taken and which none were prior to the procedure which also was quite disconcerting. I'm left with an overall It is what it is feeling for a doctor's office in Fitchburg which actually might be a little under okay but I didn't completely dislike it so got three stars.|Dr Quereshi saved my life! The pain from my broken back was taking away my desire to live. His ablation treatments took 75% of the pain away! His kindness, compassion, and willingness to explain the treatments were something that I had never experienced before. Please don't hesitate to call and ask for help!

After being entrenched in the Healthcare System for way too long, he gives me hope and no patient could ask for more especially when you are in a lot of pain.  I would ask him ""what if this doesn't work?"" he would tell me we will look at other options....again always giving me the greatest gift of hope.

Also, tje staff  is horrible especially one of the older ladies I was 9 minutes late was told to come back I've never had that happen in my life horrible place if you wanna get better this is not the place ! Also, the doctor Made me feel very uncomfortable|I am new to NSPM and have already had two procedures hoping that I get relief from back pain. I will know in 6-8 weeks. I have the highest regard for Dr. Patel. From the first appt. I left with a feeling that this gentleman was going to do the best he could to help me. He delineated a sequential plan along with a goal of relieving 80% of pain for a good period of time. He is a great listener, gathers all information during and after the initial intake and explains all in detail. I also have been very impressed with the office staff. They are personable, well organized and pleasant. Even if the procedures don't work for me, I highly recommend trying this practice especially with Dr. Patel. I am so happy that I looked for different provider.|Thank you Dr. Patel for my shot . You are warm and caring and made me feel so comfortable! Dr Kohli also had nothing but great things to say about you . Your staff is very efficient and called me this morning to see how I felt . I really appreciate that call . I highly recommend Dr. Patel and will be back for my follow up ! Thank you again|This was my 2nd visit to NSPM (Woburn).   Dr. Patel was professional, kind and really listened to what I had to say.  I received two injections and it was easy due to the minimal pain involved (1 out of 10).  Special shoutout to the tech Sophia.  She really put me at ease pre and post procedure.|I laid on my floor for a few weeks in excruciating pain. I saw Dr. Patel for a consult, and he got me in the next day for a cortisone shot in my back. The pain subsided, and it took several days to feel much better. He gave me back (no pun intended!) my life. I can't recommend him enough!!!!!!|After being hospitalized for a chronic illness, I began to suffer from "" atypical "" lower back pain. While in the hospital, they did very little to find out why. I was released and shortly after I began Pain Therapy at NSPM Center.
I was referred to this Clinic by my then PCP.  Everyone I spoke too spoke very, very highly of Dr. Patel and after my first visit, I now know why. I've been going to them for many years now for my pain treatment and I will never be able to explain how responsive and caring they were. They did tests and found out the reason for my pain and it's been being treated FULLY since I first went there.
I've had a few different Drs. / P.A's treat me there and I have nothing but great things to say about each person.
They are very caring, compassionate as well as friendly.  Do not think for a moment they will give you what you ask for, as it should be. Follow their rules and treatment plan and over time you will recieve the help you need.
Should you require pain treatment, I'd ALWAYS Highly recommend one of their Clinics.  They gave me back my life as well as my sanity!

* This review was based solely on my own personal experiences with NSPM and in no way was I EVER asked  to provide a review *|Dr Patel is warm, caring and committed to helping his patients live a better life with pain. I've only been seeing him and his support staff for 6 months, but I appreciate everyone's kindness, helpfulness and compassion!

Everything was explained to me what was being done. I really have no complaints and just hope these work.|They are absolutely fantasticI've been going there 13 years and they have been very helpful to me Dr Dominguez is fantastic and so isn't all the staff Especially Judy Harrison and Margaret Reid|Terrible service. My appointment was at 10 AM. It is 1132 and I'm still have not been seen by the doctor. Terrible terrible service. Where is the doctor? That's been over an hour and a half half and I still have not been seen. This is ridiculous. This is all to build the insurance here so unless you want to come and spend 3 to 4 hours just to get seen this is terrible service. They need to fix the service department in this building for pain management ridiculous|The staff and nurses are great but the Doctors leave a lot to be desired. No compassion and I've had 4 strokes!!! I can't walk without a walker or wheelchair my back and legs hurt so bad. I'm lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep a night. They had a great doctor but he retired. And be prepared to be there for hours for an appointment. Good luck!!!|If I could rate this with no stars I would. My appt was at 9:30. I'm still sitting in waiting for the doctor to be seen and it's 11:40. There is no reason the appts should take this long. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I will never come back.|Extremely disappointed with the doctor (DR. Eric Dominguez) that saw my mother today for her initial appointment. He had absolutely no bed side manner and was rude and dismissive. He spent all of two minutes with her and did not exam her or review her info. He basically told her they are not taking new patients and he did not want to schedule another appointment. Said she clearly needs something for pain management but he was not going to do anything or prescribe anything and referred her back to her PCP who initially sent her here because they are supposed to specialize in PAIN MANAGEMENT! Did not even talk about interventions or recommendations and just walked out of the room. Would not recommend this physician at all! Extremely unprofessional!|If I could give 0 stars I would. I have been taking my mother here for a couple months now dude to back and hip pain and every time she comes in the wait times get longer and longer. Being in the waiting room for hours for a quick injection appointment that takes 10 minutes is outrageous. Then another patient walks in waits for 15 min and is called to the procedure room ahead of people that have been waiting for hours. This is probably one of the most if not the most poorly run medical office I have ever been to and I am ashamed for taking my mother here. If I had to give one positive. The doctor was polite.|Literally with my heavy heart, I will try to be exact in explaining yesterday's experience, to start my visit to this establishment was beyond disgraceful,  NO words can really suffice the way this so called leader in pain management (DR. DOMINGUEZ) has SHOWED OUT! I am a 53 year old well educated & plenty traveled women, as a MBA graduate, I have had much sucess in my career throughout the year's, until a unexpected turn of scary health events occurred, which at this clinic to my amazement, I was treated like less than a piece of gum on the bottom of a shoe. Right from the start I was discriminated against and this was before I was able to even discuss any of my unfortunate health mishaps & concerns, while not being heard at all, this mean, Uncompassionate excuse for a Doctor failed to evaluate me , I received no examination, nor was I able to get a word in edgewise. He was so repulsive and belittling towards my tragic health misfortune. Disregarded my entire situation from the absolute minute he walked into the room, he looked at me and said what is that box on your waist? I wasn't even able to explain that I am wearing this Life vest for a reason as he rolled his eyes at me like it was nonsense, while I tried to add in simple words that this is a defilabator vest that I am currently wearing due to a unforeseen situation that occurred after I endured a pulmonary embolism after a surgical procedure and now I suffer from CHF with a heart function of only 30 percent. I suffer from Excruciating pain in my lower extremities and much chronic pain in my hip following my hospitalization.  With this being said he was only in my company for a few minutes, while yelling at me as I'm already in a frightening state to begin with he proceeds to tell me to go back to my surgeon and tell him that he is not able to help me, he also added this was a big waste of my time, which BTW was only supposed to be until I can get stronger moving towards CARDIO REHAB & PHYSICAL THERAPY. I was so distort over him when I left my nurse drove me to the nearest walk-in emergency clinic where I could get immediate vital signs as I was looking meek and faint. They treated me with care there after this inhumane treatment at St.Anne's pain clinic. All I can do now is ask the Lord to continue to be with me during this tough journey with no support from this awful place that I was referred too and in hopes that KARMA does its job.

They are understanding, compassionate and determined to help. You are not just another ""number"" here, they truly care about you and what matters to you. From the ladies at the front desk, to the nurses and doctors in back and in the Surgical center.. they're exceptional.

I'm so thankful for Dr. Silk and Hannah! I see them regularly and they have been able to develop a plan to stabilize my pain as much as possible, while we tried to find the root cause. Every appointment I've had, no matter how often, they sit and listen, and they never make me feel rushed. I receive nerve blocks and Botox from them, and they make it as painless as possible. It's great that they can do infusions here too, which has helped me soo many times and saved me from going to the ER!

I've had a complex head pain issue for years where so many neurologists, specialists and hospitals disregarded my symptoms or threw their hands up with no other alternatives. NOT Dr. Silk! He has been the ONLY doctor that listened to me over and over and didn't give up on trying to find the root cause. It's because of his ongoing efforts, the continuous support and willingness to work with any doctor that could help me, that I recently received a diagnosis from the Mayo Clinic that confirmed the symptoms that I had been describing (the same symptoms that others disregarded).|I am 76 and have suffered a life long history of migraines which became chronic and unbearable when I contracted long covid a year ago. I was fortunate to find the Boston Advanced Medicine clinic in Waltham and was able to see Dr. Silk and get immediate relief with his care which is ongoing. Dr. Silk is an expert clinician, highly compassionate and patient, and always makes himself available for consultation and support. I recommend Dr. Silk highly.|This happened about nine years ago and I am still angry about it.  The same doctors that I saw are still there. I came to the Boston Pain Center (now Boston Advanced Medicine) for pain in my leg due to a comminuted tibial plateau fracture. They took scans and couldn't find anything. They gave me back injections, which did nothing but I'm sure insurance paid well.  Then they set me up with their social worker who tried to convince me that the pain was all in my head. I said to myself enough was enough and went to an orthopedic surgeon at New England Baptist.  After taking x-rays, he asked what took me so long to get to him. Apparently according to him, ""You have no knee"".  So knee replacement was performed.  But yeah, it was all in my head. What painful agony and a waste of my time and my insurance company's money at the Boston Pain Center.|I am happy with the care I have received at Boston Advanced Medicine.   The staff is all super friendly and caring.  They understand what you are going through and do all that they can to help.  I look forward to more visits to hopefully ease my pain.  I would recommend it to anyone.|Such a wonderful group of people! Informative, kind and supportive! Dr Britt is an asset to this team.  Knowledgeable and gentle. She walked me through my options after my leg continued to hurt. After treatment my pain was 99% gone!  I'd recommend this company of professionals  to anyone dealing with injury to the joints!|Can't say enough great things about Boston Advanced Medicine and the Migraine treatments available - they changed my life. Scheduling appointments is easy, every staff member is helpful and wonderful. The care  is truly top notch.|I cannot say enough about the exceptional care Hannah Espie AGPCNP-BC and the team at Boston Advanced Medicine provide.  I have been a patient of Hannah's and Boston Advanced Medicine for over seven years.  As someone who has undergone multiple spinal fusion surgeries (fused C3-T2), chronic pain and migraines have been constant challenges in my life.  However, the expert care I receive from Hannah and the team has been a game-changer.
Hannah is highly skilled, knowledgeable, compassionate, thoughtful, and attentive. She takes the time to explain every step, ensuring comfort and precision. She is also a terrific listener.  Her precision in administering the various injections has provided me much-needed relief and significantly improved my quality of life.
I am incredibly grateful for Hannah's expertise and dedication. The team at Boston Advanced Medicine is compassionate, attentive, and highly professional. They truly understand how to work with and treat people in pain. I highly recommend Hannah Espie and the team for outstanding, patient-centered care if you need pain management.

I have transferred my care elsewhere, I recommend you don't waste your time even signing up here.
Editing since they replied stating i called while they were closed. I knew they would be closing from 12/20-01/02 so I called twice on Friday 12/13, once on tuesday 12/17 and 3 times on the 18th, like I told Gabby who called me a liar. They NEVER worked closely with my PCP until the very end when i asked for my records to be sent to a different pain clinic. My PCP took time out of her busy schedule to call them herself because she never received any notes from any of my visits or any of the recommendations they said they would send over for med changes. My situation is not complex, my MRI was very clear, which i only know because you guys violated HIPAA by faxing my MRI report to my job. That summarizes how unprofessional you guys are.|For no reason I was denied care for my spine and severe stenosis/ sciata on both sides and neuropathy on both legs and feet|I have NEVER worked with a more unresponsive medical staff in my entire life. It takes upwards of 2 weeks to receive responses from these people. When I started seeing Dr. Pearl, I was on medication that put my pain levels at a 4/10. Dr. Pearl put me on medication that made me dangerously tired (Lyrica) and eventually advised me to discontinue it. When I asked for something to replace the Lyrica, she suggested that I take Lyrica. That's not a typo - she told me to stop taking Lyrica and then suggested I try taking Lyrica. She switched my pain medication that was working to something that doesn't last as long nor control pain as well as the medication that I was taking when I started in her practice and then kept telling my doctor to reduce the amount of that medication each week. I called her office sobbing and left multiple messages. They never called me back. My doctor tried contacting her as well - no phone calls nor emails were returned. I am now at a 6/10 pain thanks to the ignorance and lack of care at this facility. Avoid them at all costs because they do not have time for you, don't care about your needs, and will make you feel worse than when you started. Shame on Dr. Pearl for calling herself a pain management specialist. You ignore your patients that you've put into worse off positions than when they sought help from you.

I'd give 0 stars if I could.|I was the second patient on the schedule no one came in the doctor was no we're to be found.
I as therapists would highly advise people not to see Dr. Perl
The staff just left me in the room for two hours with no explanation.
The CNA came in did some vibrations to my shoulder with no explanation after she was done I asked what this was for. She then explained after she maid my shoulder hurt 90% more then I walked in to the office.
I finally after not eating nor drinking anything for almost 24 hours being a diabetic and other medical conditions said enough and walked out 4 hours
Basically come to find out after speaking to the secretary I was scheduled for 12 o'clock with anesthesia and there was another person scheduled for 12 o'clock. How is one physician supposed to do to people? I'm not sure or even if it's legal.
I will be reporting to Dr.  and I will also the state and Attorney General's office.|Good morning my experience have been amazing. Your make me feels so comfortable. Is like we knows me for a long time thank you for that and I'm looking forward to continuous work with you guys. Yes we are the best specially Kate, so see you guys in July and I'm spreading my words around to other people's How much do you guys can do for them?|Dr Pearl and her team have been great. Good bedside manner and she explains the procedures to you before and as she does them.  Her aids are also very friendly and did their best to help me relax, which I really needed. I won't know if the treatment has been effective for a few weeks, but I've been pleased with the overall service and you can tell they care about their patients.|I was incapacitated after a fall. Dr. Pearl gave me my life back. Her and her staff are thoughtful and really work with you to create a treatment plan. I am forever grateful. I never thought I would  see a day where I didn't feel pain.

Out of courtesy, which I'm not sure is deserved, I won't call this doctor out by name.  My surgeon ordered a pain management procedure and when I went to BPM for a pre-procedure appt., the doctor at BPM did not agree it was the correct procedure.  This doctor asks me, ""why does your doctor want this?"".  I'm not a doctor, I can't explain the details of why a surgeon ordered a procedure, other than he thought it was the right thing for my pain, so right away I feel put on the defensive and stuck in the middle.  I explained my feelings and requested this BPM doctor consult with my surgeon who ordered the procedure.  At this point, the BPM doctor got defensive, condescending, and rude.  Some things this BPM doctor said:  ""Who is this surgeon, I have never heard of him"" (and why that is relevant, I don't understand), ""I don't talk to doctors outside of Baystate"" (really?), ""What do you expect me to say to this doctor"" (I stated my rationale that the two of them don't agree so they should consult each other - I'm not going to be in the middle).  Finally, this BPM doctor said, ""If you can produce the surgeon on the phone right now, I'll talk to him"".  It takes a month to see any doctor in this country, as if I had magical powers to get a surgeon on my phone at any time.  This request was simply ridiculous.  I said I have the surgeon's office number, I can leave it with you and you can contact him or schedule a time to speak.  My offer was not taken by this BPM doctor.  Throughout this, it's not only what the BPM doctor said, it was his tone and how he said it.  Condescending, rude, incredulous, and unprofessional.   I soon came to the conclusion that this BPM doctor had a very bad manner and I didn't want them involved in my care even if they consulted with the surgeon, so I left the appointment and I won't be going back to BPM.
I think it would benefit other patients if the Baystate Experience Team respond here and let everyone know the policies of Baystate.  (1)  Is it an unreasonable request for one of your patients to ask one of your doctors to consult with another doctor about said patient's pain management?  (2)  Is it a Baystate policy that your doctors are not allowed to consult with other doctors outside of Baystate?  Since your doctor stated he ""doesn't do this"", I'm left to believe it must be the case.  Thank you kindly in advance for your response.|If I could leave less I would. Long- chau- Van belongs in a lab somewhere not working with people. 0 help biggest waste of a copay.|THEY R WONDERFUL, STAFF IS AWSOME!  DR. MANACONTI IS THE BEST, IVE HAD SHOTS INTO MY SPINE SEVERAL TIMES FOR CHRONIC BACK PAIN AND HE NEVER HAS HURT ME.  I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO RECIEVED SHOTS IN SPINE ELSEWHERE AND SAID IT WAS AWFUL PAINFUL.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE OVER ALL OTHERS, I AM A RETIRED NURSE SO I HAVE GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF QUALIFIED  PHYSICIANS, THEY MEET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF MEDICAL  PAIN MANAGEMENT  CLINICS!|They are trash they cancel your appointment literally when you're in the office make you spend money on a ride to get there and cancel but can't reimburse you but want payment if you cancel like that|Dr Mani as well as the medical staff who always assist in my cervical spine steroid injections are very caring, they walj me through every step even when getting my procedure. The office always follows up to make sure I am well. One visit I was in tears due to other unrelated symptoms that seemed to point to either RA, PSA, or Lupus. I wasn't looking for a diagnosis, simply to have a Doctor who actually cared, to listen and at least tell me I wasn't going crazy. I had been failed by many er visits and specialists up to this point. Dr Mani took the time to listen to my history of symptoms (as it worked out one visit I was in a ""flare"") he re assured me that something was definitely going on. Based on a doctor simply giving his time to me, I reached out to Tufts and eventually made my journey to Tufts Rheumatology. I do have cervical spinal stenosis, and have since been diagnosed with Lupus(unrelated). Thank you so much Dr Mani. You are definitely one of the good ones!|My primary doc sent a referral in to the pain center for me.  It took me a month to get a first time intake phone appt. 10 seconds into the call the nurse tells me I'm not a good fit as they are not a prescribing pain clinic nor do they diagnose.  I have no idea what she was talking about. I am in severe pain, scoliosis, spondylosis, herniated discs and possible spondilytis, with severe back spasms. They refused to take me on as a patient for what reason?  2 minutes into the conversation, the phone makes a weird sound and I'm disconnected.  She never calls back..that's it...no doctor for me, no help, severe pain, and self help...no wonder why people self medicate.  I'm not there yet..Just home suffering in my retirement.  SHAME ON YOU!!!|My wife has been going here for almost 23 years. She has RSD and has pain and will the rest of her life. Dr. McKee and the staff have always treated her with respect, compassion and empathy. They have helped her have a life. I am so grateful to them for being there for her all these years. I honestly don't think she would have survived if not for them. Thank you to you all.|This place is bad news. When i had my intake call with a nurse, she had ZERO bedside manner or discernable empathy for me, the patient in pain on the other end of the phone. Told me i'd probably be dealing with my chronic pain for the rest of my life before she even booked me to see the doctor. The day of the actual appointment, the nurse was pleasant but had consent issues about asking before touching me and my clothing. I saw Dr Malick (apologies if i am misspelling his name), he went over my chart (mostly in silence) with a few questions to me, did a physical examination with more questions about my pain, then said that there wasn't anything they could offer me to help my pain. Suggested cbt or tai chi. The rest of the day i was in increased pain from the nature of the examination. Today i'm in so much pain that if anyone touches my back i will SCREAM but there wasn't anything he could do? wasn't even offered cortisone shots.",2025-01-29|2025-02-22|2025-01-14|2024-10-23|2023-05-12|2022-09-20|2022-02-07|2021-07-29,1|1|5|1|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJGaRpbTTn5okRRJiCIMw3exg,30

He has a genuine concern for helping his patients  and does whatever he can to help. He stuck with me so I have stuck with him.  His staff works with him as a team and  have always treated me with respect and have worked around my concerns rather than legalities and logistics.

He is gentle, extremely knowledgeable and I would trust him with my life. I cannot say the same of many Doctors that I have came across during my life. Although he is pain management specialist he is tops in his field. He is not affiliated with Morton Hospital. That alone is a bonus. His Medical Receptionist Courtney is a

sweetheart.|I have been seeing Dr Niaki for many years. He takes care of my severe arthritis, fibromyalgia and migraines through the use of medication and injections.  He is the most intelligent doctor I know. I feel for the other person who said they had problems with the office staff as I also have had problems with them. They rarely answer the phone or return calls, but Dr Niaki is too nice to let them go.|I'd give this office 5 stars if it wasn't for the bad attitude and lack of follow through of the receptionist i believe is named Vanessa. Absolutely horrible. You sit waiting to check in while she plays on her phone talking about remodeling her bathroom. If you address her bad attitude she threatens you with discharge. Today i went to pick up script for relative and called at 3:54 stuck up the street in traffic and nobody answered. I arrived at 3:59 to find the door locked. At 4:01 i was greeted by her ignorance. Then was threatened discharge and had the door slammed in my face. Same person had me on hold 10 min only for me to hang up and have the other receptionist pick up and answer question in less than 30 seconds. The doctor himself has given nothing less than exceptional care to both my relatives. Him and the other receptionist, Ann i believe, are amazing! We need more people like them and not like the other one. She's enough to cause a great doc to lose clients.|transfered to this doctor after belonging to another pain clinic for 3 years. Went in for a consultation. Had to sign a contract even though I had still belonged to my previous clinic. This was July 6th. Now I was told he couldn't even make an appointment until I was released from former pain center. I still had 2 scripts to fill from old clinic and when I asked Sonia the office manager she said I had to fill them because Dr. Niaki couldn't write scripts until I was released from old clinic. I filled one on 7/18/15 and other on 7/28/15. I was formally released from old clinic on 7/30/15 and his office didn't get this release until 8/3/15. So I finally got an appointment for 8/10/15, went in was put on new medication and given an appointment for an injection. I asked Sonia what I should do with the extra meds I had, do I bring them in to be destroyed??? She was very rude snapped at me and said no we don't do that here. Whatever, I went and dropped off the new medication at my pharmacy to get a call the next day saying that they were waiting to hear from Dr. Niaki to confirm I was now being seen by him. I get a call from Sonia saing I was being discharged from Niaki's office, was being flagged at every pharmacy is Massachusetts and called my old pain clinic lying saying I took his script and was trying to fill it at multiple pharmacies!!!! Was not true what so ever. During our phone conversation she said and I quote "" We deal with people like you all the time and we learn something new every time"" I said stop there I have never failed one of my drug tests at any time at my old clinic which I had belonged to for 3 years and have never, ever had any issues with my medications. I went to talk to Dr. Niaki the next day per order of the medical board and apparently he wasn't aware of his office manager's actions. I explained and still was told I could not be treated. I was telling one of the nurses what this Sonia had done to me in waiting room and how I said I had contacted the medical board and they said I wasn't in the wrong. So Dr. Niaki called me back into room, said I'm writing you a prescription for medication until you find a new pain center. I was prescribed a totally different medication then what I was on and pretty much good luck. So I started this medication 2 days ago and having withdrawals because come to find out it doesn't start working for 3 days, having chest pains, anxiety attacks ETC!! So I called his office today 2 different times to report these symptoms and not 1 return phone call. I am supposed to be monitored closely when switching medications and I was left to fend for myself. So I am waiting a call back from the medical board to go ahead with the complaint because what was done was unethical! So to all please beware, take this as a warning because you will have the same experience!!!|I have Chronic pain RSD and a bad back.  Dr. Niaki has been helping me for over 10 years.  Very friendly, great sense of humor and makes you feel at ease.  If you think that something is weird he says doesn't hesitate to tell.  After having work done on my back, I kept on feeling that my leg was wet and everytime I'd look down it was dry.  I thought it was a stupid question but Dr Niaki knew what it was right away.|I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Niaki, I have been in pain for 4 years and in the past 6 months he has helped me deal with my pain by means of injections, I am saddened today that he is gone and was told there is no return date for the Dr and I am to seek another pain clinic.

I hope all is well and wish him the best and I hope he will return|This is the worst experience I've ever had.  Today was my 2nd appt with dr. Niaki , last week was my 1st.  I was expecting to get a back injection and for him to take over my pain med as I told him  I wanted to transfer over to him because of transprtation problems.  When I was in the waiting room an elderly woman came out andcould not feel her whole left leg. They just told her to sit there and we in the waiting room had to suggest a wheelchair for her. The Dr. should not even have let her out into the waiting room, but he didn't even check on her after he found out what was going on!!  The poor woman was in tears and finally just left wheeled out by her husband.  When  I was finally called in after waiting 90 min. he acted like he didn't understand what I was talking about the meds - didn't even mention my injection.  told me to go back out to the waiting room and then had his very rude ""offiCE manager"" tell me to go pick upmy script fromthe other dr .  I  think he just wants to do his injections to make is money , by the looks of things he sees people every week or two.  Looks like he's more concerned about making money than his patients.
I got a really bad feeling from the whole office.  I would never let him touch me with a needle.  Patients beware!!!|Dr.Bijan is so amazing.

Their approach is different than the 2 other places I've used for PT for the same injury in the last 16 years. They don't just focus on the site of the pain, they look at how your chronic pain impacts the rest of your body and what you can do to change that. It's a more holistic approach and they truly listen to your concerns. Rosie at the front desk is wonderful too!|LOVE  THIS PLACE!! The entire staff is extremely friendly and caring. I've had numerous procedures done and both Doctors have always been very gentle, as have the wonderful ladies in surgical center.
Jane, the nurse I see monthly is the absolute BEST!! She and Dr Vaisman have saved my life.|Great experience! Friendly and polite staff. It's only been 24 hrs.

This is not a hospital for the people, it is a hospital for Harvard. If you have any legal woes these people will never consider helping you, and will leave you in a worse state than you came in. Quoting this from another review here, and it is very true: ""They have the power over suffering patients and seem to become angry when they're unable to help, as if it's our fault.""

Beware.|I was referred Dec10 2021 for pain and as of today Jan1,2022 after many calls I am still being told I can not even make an appointment as I have to be ""approved "" and there are no appointments for months. Seems to me if your Doctor Refers you for pain that means you are in need of help now. I have to say this undermines my confidence in this dept ability to treat people in pain or have any compassion. I will not even attempt to secure an appointment there any longer and find an alternative solution for my intense pain. So incredibly disappointed as MGH has a really good rating as a hospital and this treatment has been inhumane.|The last time I was there I saw Dr. Ping Jin! All of the doctors there have always been wonderful however I feel like Dr. Jin was one of the nicest and most through doctors that I have ever been seen by! He gave me hope and suggested alternative therapies that I have been asking for years and always denied! I'm already to most pain medications and have a very rare painful tumor disorder. I can't wait to see him again! He is definitely helping me improve my quality of life!|I was in so much pain that I couldn't stand or sit, much less walk - but apparently the physicians didn't believe me. So I was sent on my way, clinging to side rails in the hallway, and wound up passing out from pain in a restroom. Was there for hours, waking to a ""code"" and thinking ""thank god, it's finally over"".

Those docs don't meet my eyes when I see them now. Didn't file a complaint because I was afraid of revenge.

I have life long Injuries and had many surgeries including a fusion L5-S1. I was labeled a drug seeker even though I myself cut myself down on my pain meds to 1/8th and then they took me off my testosterone even though I'm diagnosed with very low testosterone due to very high stress of pain for many years. I was told to just try taking a swim. I was also seeing an doc for OMT therapy so he told me to just stick with her.

I just wish there were more people so understanding as she. Thank you so much for going above and beyond to help me|Late last December, I thought I tore a muscle in my left leg.  After four visits to the ER (where they are loathe to give out painkillers) and a series of x-rays, the cause was determined to be spinal in nature.  Some days, I had to use a cane to walk (I am 77).  I finally got an appointment to the Pain Center on March 8th.  I arrived at 7:30 for my 8 am appointment, did my paperwork, and
paid my co-pay.  I then waited until 9 am for a rather arrogant Dr. Benjamin Henkle to arrive, who gave me all of 10 minutes of his time (another patient was waiting).  He felt the pain was caused by a pinched nerve, but refused to start a treatment plan without the results of an MR (which is still pending).  My next appointment was to be by phone.  I left still in pain and $40 poorer.  Two weeks later, I am still angry about this.  I will not return to the Center; instead, I have just started alternative treatment by acupuncture.  (More on this later.)|Everyone here is so welcoming and an extreme comfort to me when I'm there.  Every time I'm there they have made me feel safe and comforted me when I was feeling anxious during a procedure.  They have been there for me any time I've needed them.  I'm greatly appreciative of this team.|Please do not take your elderly parents to this clinic. If I could give zero stars I would. First of all the man at the front desk couldn't tell us where to go properly when I called for the name and address, he kept referring to a landmark that I didn't know and sounded like he was half asleep. They are not sensitive to patients that don't have access to computers to do things electronically. Had a paper form to fill out and they kept my 96 year old mother waiting while we got all kinds of insurance information and an adjusters name and phone # before they would see her. She has health insurance that they can bill if for some reason there is an issue. Then when we were all done Dr. Adler said she couldn't see her because she was going to lunch. My mother has been in pain for months and finally got this appt after waiting 2 weeks and they refused to see her. I understand that they need insurance info but my daughter was there with her and they refused to see her while my daughter filled out the paperwork. They never indicated that they wouldn't be able to see her until everything was completed during the half hour process of completing the paperwork.  We could've rescheduled and brought the paperwork in fully completed at the next appt.  I work for a doctors office and we would never refuse to see a pt based on the fact that paperwork was not completed, especially someone who is 96 years old and in pain.  We will definitely be seeking care elsewhere and escalating this treatment up the chain of command.

I really appreciate his expertise.|I've been going to doctor Kumar for  years he has relieved my pain for years. That's why I'm on this right now because I'm seeking his help again. After 2 years of relieving my back pain. He's excellent at what he does. Hopefully he can relieve it for another 2 or 3 years. Wouldn't seek anyone else|Despite the secretary and the doctor both being friendly, this place is a joke. On my initial visit, I wasn't put in a room till 1 1/2 hrs after my scheduled appointment time, then it took another 1/2 gr before the doctor finally came into the room. I was scheduled for a procedure a few weeks later. They called me the day before to let me know my insurance needed a release form that they never had me sign. I went above and beyond and got them my medical history from my previous doctor and hand delivered it, because they said I could possibly still get it approved in time. The next day, I was told a different story, that the insurance company had denied the procedure because they didn't have the proper paperwork and they (the doctor's office) didn't have time to get it done because they have other patients that need paperwork done, too. I then spoke to my insurance company, hoping to get the approval pushed through quickly on my own. They informed me that the actual reason for the denial was that the secretary had submitted the paperwork with the wrong date, and there was no way they could do anything about it because of that. So not only did they totally drop the ball, but they lied to me, letting me think I could possibly fix the situation, causing me to waste a lot of time, and the gas to drive back and forth to their office with paperwork they didn't even need. Total B.S.|I am not sure why there are any negative reviews. Dr Kumar and his staff are excellent. They are always sweet and professional.
I lived in extreme pain until I met Dr. Kumar. I highly recommend him and his staff.|Have been treated by Dr. Kumar  for several years, and would never seek pain management care anywhere else. He and his staff are compassionate, patient, knowledgeable and professional. The assessment process is thorough, and continuity of care a welcome relief when you have a chronic condition.|Absolutely the most unprofessional doctors office and staff that I have ever seen hands down.

Every time I'm there I have waited 2 hours before being seen, they are low staffed at the front desk, always rude and end up throwing patients under the bus. Incredibly rude nurses and every excuse under the sun has been made to make you feel like it's your fault your there.

I have been almost fired from my job with how many times I have had to reschedule on their behalf because they somehow don't know how to function as a team and as a professional doctors office.|Truly, Dr Kumar is the best ! He has helped me so much with my back. I have been going to him since 2015. He is very caring and he never lets you wait in pain for months. I have always been able to get an appointment right away.|Love Dr Kumar! But his support staff is mediocre at best.

You're not just a patient they make you feel more like family. After years of dealing with chronic pain I finally found a Dr that cares. From the staff to the PA's really feel the need to update my comment. Just read a comment from a patient that said they would not recommend advanced pain management. Nothing could be further from the truth she stated that the operating room was filthy riches so false. And that Dr Kumar cares nothing more than money.

He sits down with you and is very patient and professional and personable.  The staff is so awesome I always enjoy seeing them.  I would recommend anyone to go here as he does help with my pain and I appreciate Dr. Kumar and his associates.  Millie Bowman|October 11th was my first and last visit at the Advanced Pain Management clinic in Stoneham. I saw Dr. Kumar and he was extremely insensitive and rude during our visit. A lot happened during our visit but I'd like to go over what bothered me the most. I have Rheumatoid arthritis and Fibromyalgia along with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, OCD and have struggled with eating disorders (anorexia & bulimia) for 10 years now. He was asking about my mental illnesses and when I had mentioned that I have OCD, he asked me why I thought that I have OCD so I replied that I was diagnosed with it and he was asking me who diagnosed it and asked for examples so I gave them. One of those examples was that I have obsessive thoughts about my appearance and self.
He told me that I should cut back on one of my medications (Gabapentin) that's really helping me because my weight is on the ""heavy side"" and the medication is ""making me FAT"". He put a lot of emphasis on that one word. There are ways to tell someone that you would like them to lose weight in a nice way and when someone has an eating disorder, it's a more delicate situation. That information is in my records and he can see it. I told him that most days are quite difficult for me and I asked him if there are any pain medications besides narcotics that could help me. Also, let me add that Gabapentin does not cause weight gain!
He wanted to prescribe me Tramadol and another medication, Provigil that I hadn't heard of. The Provigil medication was for daytime sleepiness and I told him that I don't have that but apparently because I'm a smoker, I do (That's what he told me). I told him I didn't think I needed that nor did I want a prescription for it. I hate medication which I expressed to him and no one should take unnecessary medications. I mentioned that I had gotten several cortisone shots in the past year or so for my hip and he wanted me to make an appointment to get a cortisone shot and I told him that it wasn't bothering me right now so I didn't see the need for it and he told me I should do it anyway.
He wanted me to quit smoking asap and asked what my plan is to quit. I told him that I would need to gradually cut back before quitting and he told me that wouldn't matter and it would do nothing for me. He wanted me to quit then and there basically and told me that I'm doing nothing about it after I told him that I already have been cutting back.
After he tried to phone one of his staff members so they could write my prescription and couldn't get them after 3 times, he told me to wait and then went to the receptionist area and started verbally abusing his staff members. He was asking why no one answered the phone and exaggerated that he called 10 times, asked where one of his staff were and when no one knew, said ""You all are the worst team ever"" among other things. If he were my boss, I would have walked out. I wanted to walk out of that room and I should have. I have PTSD from childhood trauma and was already upset as it was but I was trying to keep it together as he was saying horrible things to his staff. He came back in, and then told me that I ""need to smile more"". I looked at him and said that I have depression. Then I told him about my eating disorders and how what he said about my weight hurt me because I struggle every day with trying not to starve myself, to exercise more, etc and it's hard when you're both in chronic pain and have depression. To that, he replied that I can ""sit, cry about it and feel sorry for myself"" or I can ""go exercise and lose weight"". After I just explained how the pain makes it difficult.
More happened but I feel that these are the most important highlights. NO ONE deserves this kind of treatment from a Doctor. I called back later and cancelled the 2 week appointment for a cortisone shot that I was pressured into making and said I won't be filling the prescription that was given to me and that I won't be returning, either.",2024-05-09|2022-03-02|2022-02-18|2022-01-04|2023-08-11|2019-02-02|2021-02-26|2017-10-12,2|5|5|5|4|5|5|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|board_certified_physicians|medication_management|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|thorough_care|good_doctors|convenient_clinic_location,,,,,,,,,,ChIJk5TyzIxz44kRm_MoRgsvJ2s,37

However, she'd not adequately explained about the injection. I had to ask what level she wanted to inject. She told me 2 different levels,  and one of them was where I had a fusion already, so it was a very unlikely source of pain. I questioned it. The whole reason I was referred to her was for a diagnostic injection, to confirm the level causing the pain before moving to surgery.  Her answer was ""standard protocol.""   You're picking a fused level based on ""protocol""?  I asked her to help me understand that. Instead she took injection off the table and suggest pills instead.  (Gabentin, a heavy-duty nerve pain pill, or flexoril, a strong muscle relaxer - neither of which were indicated based on my intensity of symptoms. I declined.)  Finally, she suggested physical therapy, which I'd already done. This was a big waste of time and money.

and nobody cares. dr gannon was a great doctor but the staff usually doesn't even answer the phone|I have been going to this clinic for many years. They are very consistent with effective treatments. It is difficult to feel heard in today's health care system. It is easy to feel anonymous, like you are just another number so easily dismissed. At Cape Cod Pain,  even though they have a lot of patients it never feels that way. I don't know of any other staff that would would make a point to give a hug, and words of encouragement when you're struggling to make sure you're ok. Everyone in that office is amazing, they listen and do what they can for you. That is what health care should look like, treating the whole person. Pain is a complicated, personal experience. It's about quality of life as well as quality of care, one in the same at Cape Cod Pain Management. Huge thanks to all the staff.|March,2022: seen by Dr.Gannon and the Nurse Practitioner, however phones go to voice-mail, unable to get through. if your lucky you may get a person you explain purpose of your call for the Dr and don't get a return call not to mention hung up on by staff who did answer phone after me trying for 5 days, Urinalysis procedures I absolutely question! I question these reports! I don't do drugs of any kind NEVER in MY LIFE and never tested positive for any drug test for work , any previous ,& current physcian random screenings
or monthly one's per pain management contract and I've always tested negative for over 18 years . I @ first visit give my urine which remained in an unsecured bathroom that others use and, the following month @ my second visit I'm told by Dr.Gannon I tested positive for cocaine (very small trace amt he says) absolutely impossible I told him  because I DO NOT DO DRUG'S  never have and never would & that couldn't have been my urine sample tested because it definitely would have been negative. I said ""my urine if that one tested was even mine, and not someone else's then my urine was tampered with after I left my urine sample"", screening even said I tested positive
for a medication in my Urine that is not prescribed, that also is NOT TRUE my medication list in my chart clearly shows this medication is in fact prescribed to me and has been for a very long time. He says nothing about that though even the lab made an error in data entry because these results are wrong.. MA make the mistake ?  Someone did. I give them a urine sample  during (2nd visit ) this time I insisted I hand my urine sample directly to Medical Assistant because I do not trust it being left in that unsecured bathroom, so @ the following month's follow up visit nothing is said to me what my urine test came back as,  I had to ask I at this point I don't trust them and was told ""oh it's negative"" as if I was bothering her tone of voice as she said it , because the last visit in fact had bothered me so much that while @ 3rd visit this time with NP, I mention how upsetting this has been to me because it is NOT true at all, I Do not do drug's and, I was not given the option to challenge the urine test result from 1st urine test and that I even called the lab who's name and number that was on test result sheet Dr.Gannon gave me During the 2nd visit at office and when I called that number i got through to a live person and the person told me they do covid 19 testing only. I was shocked by what I had just been told. At next appointment expressed politely to NP that I request that the first Urinalysis screen be removed from medical records because i know it is wrong she told me after leaving the exam room and spoke to office staff what I said to her. I know this because I saw, and heard her, the exam room door was left open.she said to me after making my next follow up appointment with Dr.Gannon in a month(btw never took place )for further treatment (injection) to my spine, and to talk to office worker at the front window on my way out before I leave to have it removed because that particular staff worker is the only one who can do it, who wasn't available I was told.  This place has me looked at now as one who does by new Specialists. That don't know me but I am judged based off of this inaccurate screening that is still in my medical record & that is wrong on so many levels. I even mention what happened to me at Cape Cod pain management right up front  and I'm made to look like a liar to new Specialists and it is so wrong and this place staff need to be trained better , office Manager extremely rude,  unprofessional very argumentative, towards patient as well as the one who sits at the front desk window she too has an attitude problem, and ANSWER THE PHONES! THIS IS A DR.OFFICE AND PATIENTS CANNOT GET THROUGH TO OFFICE. MESSAGES GO UNRETURNED.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL FRONT END
OFFICE STAFF. What kind of Doctor's office doesn't answer phone's? This o ridiculous.|Very difficult to get in touch with someone and once you do they never get back to you. I've once been left on held for 15 minutes while they looked for a referral and never came back to the line. Never mind the several times they never called me back when i either left a message or spoke to someone. I've called several times and had my pcp send several referrals, all of which were ignored. Believe the reviews, look elsewhere.|This place is the most unprofessional, horribly run business and I wouldn't send my worst enemy to deal with this ""doctor"". Him and his staff is rude, nobody answers the phone...EVER and nobody ever returns calls. Also there is no emergency line, THEY DON'T CARE. I was pushed onto the NP who is also unprofessional and rude along with her MA, who thinks she runs the place. He gave me wayyy more than the yearly allowance of cortisone shots cause all the money he makes off them. I had to advocate for myself to see a surgeon. By that time I need two back fusions!! I continued on their pain management although it was never being managed. Nobody cared. Loooong story short, DON'T GO! You will be treated poorly and used just for his monetary gain.|What a great Pain Management office. Dr Gannon is wonderful, he listens, and he is compassionate. The staff, and Rebecca, are outstanding. Thank you for your years of care.|This office bills fraudulently. A 5 minute conversation with the doctor which consisted of Dr. Gannon telling us the appt was useless without diagnostic imaging reports- despite the appointment being scheduled by that office fully aware they did not have the records.  When trying to dispute the charges, the office manager Lindsey is no help- even with her acknowledgement that a complete treatment plan was never established. She even tried to say a prescription was generated at the consult. This was incorrect and she was referencing a medication trialed by PCP.  Absolutely do not come to this office. Disorganized, dysfunctiona, and fraudulent.|Had an app to go to dr Gannon cuz my clinic is closing. My pain Dr recommended him.

Every appointment I had with this doctor I waited over an hour to see. This is ridiculous. The receptionist  told me they take patients in all the time. Patients without appointments call in claiming they have  pain to increase thier sales for the day meanwhile making patients with appointments wait. My primary care doctor closed his practise. He prescribed meds that were working great for my pain. Doctor Feliz talked me into getting back injections for my back Back pain. They lasted about a week of relief. I told him I wanted my old scripyts I had been down this road before. I ended up going to another pain clinic . They gave me the scripts my PM doctor had been giving me and I feel great. I thought doctors were supposed tolisten to patients and find out what thier need are. This doctor obviously had his own agenda of pushing injections. I know for a fact these pain doctors make a fortune on these injection methods. Dr Feliz kept pushing the injections. Finally I said enough. I went to a differant pain clinic and they gave me the meds my Primary care doctor was giving me and I feel 100 percennt better and 98% myself.  Everyones afraid of prescribing pain meds.

I was in excruciating pain & could barely move. My previous doctor had me so strung out on Oxycontin (120 mg/day) & Oxycodone (80 mg/day) that I barely answered to or recognized my own name. I ended up in the Emergency Department on a Thursday after not realizing I took WAY TOO MUCH Ambien over a weekend because I was way too strung out on the 2 types of Oxy!!! I immediately DITCHED my old Pain Management Doctor & was referred to Dr. Farid. It was the ABSOLUTE BEST decision I could've made!

I have an EXTREMELY COMPLICATED medical case that causes me to have EXCRUCIATING pain throughout my entire body. When I first saw Dr. Farid, I spent my days in the dark, curled up in the fetal position on the couch, balling my eyes out!!! That was my routine for the first 2 years of getting really sick! I walked into Southbridge Interventional Pain Clinic with controlled optimism for my first visit. Dr. Farid spent lots of time with me that day trying to understand my disease processes in order to determine the best course of treatment going forward. We started out with two specific types of medication, hoping they would help alleviate the majority of my pain. The meds helped, but not nearly enough! The next month at my appointment, we re-evaluated my case & moved on to two new medications. JACKPOT!!! The new meds worked & got my pain down from way off the chart (the smiley face chart used to determine how bad your pain is) to a bearable 91/2 on the chart. After a few months of being on the new medications, we began discussing the next steps. Dr. Farid felt that Radio Frequency Ablation would be of benefit to me. I decided to follow his advice & have the RFA done. Once we determined that injections would alleviate some of my pain, we scheduled my first RFA for the following month. He was right!!! The RFA procedure helped alleviate more of the pain in my back! We scheduled the next 3 quadrants of my back over my next 3 monthly follow-up appointments. I'm still seeing Dr. Farid & having RFA's done on my back as needed in combination with receiving pain meds. The combination of treatments helps keep my pain levels bearable (somewhere down between 81/2-91/2) each & every month.

Dr. Farid, his Medical Assistants, the past Physician's Assistant & everyone in the front office are very kind, compassionate & empathetic!!! They all care very much & go out of their way to help, whether it's fitting you in because something has changed for you & you really need to be seen, getting an answer to a question you may have, helping to reschedule your appointment if the one you have no longer works for you or because you're ill & can't make it into the office when you're scheduled to, or anything else you run into. Dr. Farid is extremely kind, empathetic, caring, compassionate & an expert in his field!!! I got very lucky back in April 2012 when I was referred to him & found an amazing doctor who was determined to find relief for me, but who was also interested in me as a person, what was going on in my personal life, not just my disease processes! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, Dr. Farid & the entire staff of Southbridge Interventional Pain Clinic, you've all played a huge role in giving me back part of my life!!!!!|the shot i get for my leg pain from breaking my tibia bone an a aritey all at once 2 years ago. really helps me alot an they are always so nice an kind there everytime i go an i was nervous about getting the shot but it really really helps me id recommend comming here:)|Most of these reviews over 1 star are definitely staff members. This is one of the worst places to go if you are looking for help. Yes, pain medicine isn't ideal for most cases but plenty of patients actually need it so they can live their daily lives. My FIL had tried all the things this doctor asked him to try, he said he would try medication if shots didn't work. The cortisone helps for a day and the electric shots put my FIL at risk as he is very prone to seizures and heart attacks. This place lied to my very sick father and so I felt it necessary to write a review. Not every patient is looking to get high off medicine but this doctor judges you harshly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!|The place is busy. But many people are in pain, especially via aging, injury, or whatnot.  The Doctor and his staff are very caring. It is good to have this localized treatment of painful areas than taking pain meds which lose their effectiveness or become addicting.|I have been a patient of Dr. Farid for eight years now. He has helped stop the intense pain i have had in my neck and back sine a car accident I was involved in on 12/2/1988. He is very professional and caring. I have gone in hardly able to stand and after an injection administered by him walk out feeling pain free. I must say that after getting to know Dr. Farid He is not one of those doctors that just want to prescribe narcotics. so if you're truly needing pain relief He is the doctor for you, but if you're looking for a drug dealer then look somewhere else.|Those who know of me know that my chronic pain conditions are excruciating to the highest degree, and if I can help just one person by writing this, here goes: Don't waste your time here.

If you have a severe and complicated issue that involves most or all of your body, then this place cannot help you. They will sit you down after a long wait, tell you that they don't prescribe medications, schedule you for shots months out at a time, which don't work and are known to cause quite a lot of harm and do very little good, if any at all, and then prescribe you medicine (contradiction?), and then scoot you out the door as quickly as possible. If you're coming here for pain relief, then I'm sorry to say that only those with uncomplicated and localized issues will have a chance at finding relief here. And at that, don't expect relief within the first 3-6 months of making an appointment - between the shots and different meds, it could take literally years to get the right spot and combo to actually get any relief. The lucky ones find relief within the first few visits.

And no, they do not disclose any of this when you first come in.

If you're like me, and you experience very high pain levels on a daily basis, then god bless you, never give up. Keep fighting, and keep looking. Relief is out there, you just have to find it. The right doctor, the right treatment, the right medicine combo, etc. You'll find it.|True story as other reviews have stated in the past. This place is not ideal at all, as they only offer cortisone shots, you show up and there is more paperwork than the dmv to fill out and then you wait well over an hour, again to find out they only do the shot. But your back is feeling better and so you think... I'll think about this.

Fast forward and I'm now in severe pain again. I call 3 times. Hung up on each time. What sort of place is this? Not a professional one. So they get a one star.|My first appointment, Dr. Farid was an hour and a half late to see me. He spent 5 minutes with me and recommended a procedure involving some novicane shots as a test for nerve ablation. I left for 4 weeks with no help.

Today, I called an hour before my appointment to see if I should come on time or late considering the waiting room was very uncomfortable for someone with a broken back. The nice lady assured me that if I came on time I'd be seen right away.

When I showed up, there were two people in the waiting room, and I checked in. Then I sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes before I got up and reminded the secretary of our phone conversation. She brought me right in, sitting me in a room with the same chairs as the waiting room where I waited another 30 minutes before a nurse practitioner came in.

The NP wanted me to consent to 8 steroid injections, one at a time, under x-ray for a temporary relief test, FAR from the novicane shot the doctor talked about, and she admitted I may get more pain for a few days if it went poorly.

I refused treatment and the NP told me that an hour plus, wait is normal for this practice. Apparently injections for temporary relief pay the doctor very well.",2024-12-19|2024-09-24|2024-03-04|2023-08-26|2022-08-06|2021-09-27|2021-12-03|2020-02-24,5|5|1|5|5|1|1|1,,,"12 p.m.|1 p.m.|11 a.m.",51.666666666666664|45.833333333333336|45,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do I need a referral before coming to you?","I would think it depends on your insurance.",long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJoaMn5jqi5okR64MpMPT2v1g,24

Second visit I waited for over an hour to go over my MRI results. When I got in to see the Nurse Practitioner Maria Aguiar she was curt and rude to the point where I walked out. I filed a complaint with South Coast. Dr. Phillips called me to apologize. I came back in and waited another 45 minutes in the waiting room.

I was scheduled an appointment for early August to which the called and told me they had to reschedule well into September.

The appointment went well, the people at the front desk were kind and welcoming, and the evaluation itself was done in a very professional, educational manner so I could understand everything that was being done and why it was being done. At the end of the evaluation, Dr. Dorn said I would have a letter sent to my PCP as well as to my home including notes about the evaluation and his diagnosis. He said I would have this letter in ""five to seven days"".

Now, normally I would think that I was the one in the wrong. Maybe he said 57 days and not 5-7 because it's now May 9th, 2023 and still no letter. But, after the evaluation, he said my PCP should ""receive the letter by this time next week."" So realistically she should have had it by February 27th in that case.

I've called multiple times over the last few weeks only to be told the notes aren't finished yet. The only explanation I've been given is that Dr. Dorn is ""old school."" I didn't know old school meant he still carved words into stone because that's the only way I can see these notes not being done.

Not only that, but now they act like I'm bothering them whenever I call. I just need these notes I've been waiting 2.5 months for so I can move on with my life and get my ADHD under control so my everyday life isn't a complete struggle anymore.|I have been seeing Tracy Np for a few years now for my back an neck which I have been in pain an uncomfortable for years with she is absolutely amazing she listens an talks to you about any an all concerns!

I get it, things happen and appointments run late, but at least have the common courtesy to let the patient know. So unprofessional and a waste of time. My first experience was okay, but wasn't extremely happy with it either. Definitely better places out there. I definitely won't be back to this place.|This is letter I wrote to one of the PA's about my experience so far. I stand by it. ""Dear _______, today I received a call from scheduling stating the appt for Monday Sept 24th was canceled and to be re-scheduled into October. You know I haven't been able to have a normal life since June, can't walk or stand to any degree. Three of three apps have been canceled on the day of or the preceding work day. There was no followup by the Doc who did the epidural injection. I have also reached out for reviews of the the MRI which clearly show nerve compression.

I've see many at your facility and in the several major hospitals in Boston. He he outshines all of them. Do not let him go anywhere.|I had my first appointment with Dr. Doherty this week. He fit me in a day early due to the expected snow on my appointment day. The facility was clean and tidy. The staff is pleasant, efficient, and knowledgeable. Dr. Doherty had read through my chart and was familiar with my case. He asked questions, gave me the opportunity to answer, and to ask any questions that I had. I didn't feel rushed through the appointment even though the office was busy. I am pleased with my experience.|I was with Granite State Pain for 8 years or so. Dr. Grover and Dr. Tuscano were fabulous! I think it got sold last year?  The new owner has decided to move everything to Southern NH. They just dumped a ton of patients, no warning, no referrals, and no return calls! I met with Dr Doherty in December 2024 and had him do a RFL. The procedure went great and he was great too. He said, "" Call if you need anything."" Well, a few days later I did need something, I was in horrible pain! I called, several times. Left several messages, and they ignored every single one. I went somewhere else for help, thankfully they helped. When I went in January for my appointment I asked the receptionist why I didn't get a call back. She looked in the notes and said that Dr. Doherty was confused by my message. I replied that I had left my number, if he was confused he should have called, and that I had been in horrible pain. Her reply was this; ""Well in our defense Dr. Tuscano and Ashly just up and left, and we do have 1800 patients."" My reply, "" I can see why they left and now you 1799 patients."" I didn't bother seeing the doctor that day, I left. I still haven't gotten a call back. They don't return calls. I was with them for 8 years or so.  They are not the same caring company. I don't recommend them and that makes me sad because they were once very caring, always called back, and always checked on you after a procedure. Now many of us are struggling to get our records from them.|Dr. Doherty is probably the best Dr. i've ever had. No exaggeration.. He listens and always addresses my concerns. The Drs im used to usually give me a pat on the back and say come back and see me and we'll see how that worked. Dr. Doherty does that also, but gives me directions on how to improve my condition . I feel lucky to have a Dr. that hears  what im saying. And not just nodding their heads.
 Thanks Doc !|He's the injection specialist but I felt listened to throughout the entire visit. He gave relevant feedback showing he'd been listening. They handled my doctor leaving w/a smooth transition which I'm grateful for. It was a first visit, I'll be seeing someone else for med management related care. I've had several PA's and physicians over the years. Only a few issues. Dr. Doherty is a good guy.|I have just undergone a serious neck and back surgery, so I had a telehealth appointment with Yelena. We had a great visit. Yelena was very easy to speak with and she really cared about the serious pain I am undergoing. She always takes the time to ask how I am doing and I enjoy the relationship we have built. She's  the 4th provider I have had and she is one of the best provider I have had. I would recommend her to anyone who is having chronic pain issues!! I'm so grateful to be a patient of Yelena's!!|Dr. Doherty provided a very pleasant and professional experience at Granite State Pain Associates in Merrimack, NH.

I promise you no explanation from Any doctor, but when my doctor recommended Dr. LoMonaco, I was scared because of my experience in the past, but when I finally did his recommended procedure.....Guess what? I feel like a brand new person. His office staff was gentle, respectful and made me feel welcome. They have a water bubbler, big tv, small decent waiting area, very clean office and patient rooms. They have a elevator and lots of parking. Plenty of food choices downstairs and a beautiful view of the pond out back, and the staff don't look ghetto and are either professionally dressed or in uniform with credentials so you know they are legit.

Let me start by saying that Dr. Rustam has been my doctor for a while now. Unfortunately I get chronic bad back pain and have had this since I was a teen.  Recently my back pain has returned. I've  been trying to make an appointment at his office and one of his staff members Jackie  has been very rude. Every time I try to make an appointment she keeps saying ""we're going to call you"" ""were going to call you"" ( nobody has called). So today  I went into the office to try to get an appointment since my back is hurting a lot and once again they told I had to see Jackie in order to make the appointment.  (Lol why do I have to see Jackie again smh) So Jackie told me that Dr. Rustam could not see me and she would call me to make the appointment. I got very upset and told her no I need an appointment now. So she told me that the Dr. Said he can't see me until mid March but then told me very rude to find another doctor. My whole life of working in the medical field because I also work in the medical field I've never been disrespectful to a client of mine or seen such an unprofessional staff  if I was you, I would find another doctor. Don't waste your time coming here.|Best!!! I live with pain and discomfort due to a rear end collision that cause me an injury. I am fortunate that I can use alternative pain relief rather than opioids 
Dr Rustum is good at his job and I appreciate that he listens, explains and makes sensible options for the best outcome.|Helped ease my pain, but, gee! when I noticed they were charging worker's comp for the visits appropriately AS WELL AS medicare, I was abruptly discharged. Spoke to medicare about the double-dipping, they took back the money BUT this corrupt billing department repeatedly resubmitted those bills under different diagnosis codes... so many times that medicare just paid them the illegal bonus! ps Doctor vist is extremely brief and I was told by an office nurse that the only reason they do vital signs which, lol, is the most time-consuming part of the visit, is because MVPM discovered that insurance companies pay them more if a blood pressure is taken.|If there was a 0 i would have used that. When you have chronic pain issues and need to find a doctor, you go to a pain management clinic. Not this place. i went to find help and got nothing but a lecture about not trying every surgery possible. Ive already had one back surgery, really cant afford another.

We've had better. The Doctor's nurse was very good. The Doctor did not make us wait. Doctor was polite, interested, listened and explained in detail the reason for pain, the report of the MRI and the action needed. Doctor made a referral and explained why. Relief medicine for pain was offered and ordered. The departure was without incident,
Patient was taken to the car by her own driver.. However, a lady (well dressed employee came to the car and offered to help with the patient and wheelchair.|Only my second visit to this facility but so far they've been very good. Dr. Cerasuolo is kind and explains everything thoroughly. The staff in general are fairly nice and attentive. The only two issues I've had is with the check out and scheduling. Everyone has to stand in the same line line for check out and check in. This makes for a bit of a wait on both sides of it. After my first visit they said they'd call me with my next appointment but that never happened. I waited about 3 weeks and wound up calling them for the appointment myself. Outside of those slight inconveniences I find this facility to be very good.|He tried pushing surgery and implants over n over again even tho I told him I want no injection's nor chips in me. I looked at the long long lists of risks associated with the implants on my own time n they were disturbing side effects in which the Dr didn't mention n said they rarely happen which was a lie because there was alot of stories from people who got it n had NOTHING but severe complications with it. I do not trust any Dr who pushes horrible pills n procedures while saying they are safe n effective when clearly that is not the facts. Our health system is now a death system. Do your own research n never take a drs advice without looking 8nto it yourself|Pain management is now just giving injections!! The drs are in fear or totally uneducated on the need for pain medication for those of us with intractable chronic pain, we are not addicts!! Stand up for your patients.  Instead dr Joe opted to walk out during my appt because he didn't want to discuss this with me!!! Yes a dr walking out on a patient!! So disgusting and shameful!!!  Pain mgmt drs aren't really any help anymore for long time pain sufferers!!  There is the lowest rate of opioids being prescribed ever yet overdose deaths are at the highest, why? Because those in pain mgmt do not abuse pain meds!! So drs need to learn the truth and look at the many studies to prove the truth.|I don't even know where to start because I am still blown away and offended of the treatment I received as a new patient my first time ever here .when I went into the room with my wife and the intake nurse she asked me some questions and asked about meds I take then she gave me paper work to fill out and in that paper work there was two forms  called  SOAP. Well when I began to read the question I imiditly felt offended such personal and private questions that do not pertain or have anything to do with pain management these questions I feel are disrespectful and offensive most questions are someone's privacy it is non of pain management's office business to ask patient private questions like this My God I feel labeled it took me over 18 months to go back into pain management and this doctor Cerasuolo didn't even want to touch he only kept going by the notes of a past Doctor whom I wrote an administrative complaint against 18 months ago the treatment the doctor gave Mr was offensive I had to be persistent just so he would check me then finally he said stand up let me ch3ck you that when I found out that my brain injury has cause issue with my arms .if I didn't keep being persistent for this doctor to check me out .he would have never done it .and I would have never know about issue with my arms .I almost did not know of another medical condition I have if I did not push the issue of my health last two years .what is someone sapose to do when a doctor meets you and his first question to was what do you want me to do for you.then it gets even worst when we talk about opioid and he then states to me that he prescribes pain medication to some patients but because I'm over 50 he would prescribe pain medication to me .I was saprised of his answer then he container to explain his reasons not to prescribe me pain medication. Because I'm over 50 and the risk is high in his personal opinion that I will become an addict and become addicted to opioid. MY GOD I'm am still blown away I still hear his voice in my head since yesterday I have ptsd anxiety disorder memory disorder long term back and spine issue he never asked for medical record only went by a doctors notes whom I have a discrimination complaint against I told the doctor he should have all my medical history not treat me by using notes from other doctors I fear of the treatment when I go back there it took a advocate to help me fight to get in that pain management from day one they have treated me like a lesser person. I am Latino I am sick of this treatment. he even ignored everything I was saying about my pain and health I'm still so shocked over my first visit ever to this pain management hospital. I can write so much more even my family is offended of the SOAP questionnaire|Seems that my new dr. Only cares about my ""high dose "" of pain medication.Then threatened me with lowering my dosages if I happen to have him see me again instead of my regular NP or MD,very unprofessional. I go to a pain clinic for the past 12 years  because I'm in pain.If the lovely dr dosent like treating pain with meds then he should find an alternative that actually works.until then don't threaten people that you have never seen before .|He was very understanding of my extreme anxiety of the lumbar epidural I was having. Help calmed me down and understand everything very clearly. The procedure was nearly painless and only took approximately 20 minutes.|Dr Cerasuolo is an awesome back doctor! He is my favorite!!!

But he could see me and told me I was doing movements that I wasn't doing because I can't. I heard him and saw him . He was a little weird. Maybe intoxicated . Ordered a CT scan and MRI for me. It took almost 3 months for MRI and he never prescribed anything for me . Mri tech asked me why I had not taken my meds before procedure. I didn't have any. I don't know what to ask for. Dr Kaplan should have prescribed something she said. CT scan had to be approved and never happened. Horrible experience. I was hit by a man who ran a red light. I'm in so much pain. Cannot get help.

Staff at the front desk very friendly which made me feel very comfortable. Shelly and Sharon were quite the time the team at the front desk. The RN, Mary was awesome. Spent a lot of time when me which was so comforting. She was not only professional but very friendly. When Dr. Oh came in to see me, I was very impressed. She went over my records and my recent tests. Explained in detail what was going on and when I asked her a question, she was very happy to explain in detail to make sure I had a clear understanding of what the situation was. Even after all my questions, before she left, she asked me if l had any other questions. She was so thorough that when l left, l had a clear understanding of what going on.  I highly recommend this facility and this very competent staff. Not sure it Sonia was in the right office.|Front desk staff is very rude from scheduling apts to just the way they speak to you.

I left and went else where wouldnt recommend|Been trying to get an appointment for over 4 months. I have tried on three occasions but keep getting the runaround. If you call the office, they will be too busy to talk to you and ask if they can call back in 5-10 minutes. Spoiler Alert: they don't call back. If you decide that waiting 2 hours has been long enough before calling back - you will be shocked to find out that they won't even remember your initial phone call. It's kind of funny in its own way. They say laughter is the best medicine, but when you are living in pain and need treatment - laughter doesn't cut it.

If your specialist refers you to this center - please do not listen to him or her. Ask for another center or option. Trust me.|VERY rude front desk staff-dismissive and passive aggressive when scheduling appointments. Communication overall in terms of following back up with patients VERY poor also.|Dr. Oh and her team of nurse practitioners are very unprofessional.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTING YOUR TREATMENT HERE!

After waiting for over a month for treatment, they refused to treat me on the day of my surgery and were rude about it.  I was originally told an Uber car was an acceptable form of transportation after surgery but, on the day of the surgery they refused me, saying it was unacceptable and only a family member can drive me home.  I was not told this beforehand in the initial interview a month earlier, nor was I told in writing.  I don't have family living anywhere near the state of MA so, they pretty much screwed me and the insurance company for the costs of visits and X-Rays.

I filed an official complaint with the HMO and they are now under investigation.  - I'm now forced to find treatment elsewhere, which means going out of my local area, from where they monopolise, and start with a new hospital, a new primary care doctor, and a new orthopedic and pain managment treatment center.|I have been going to this pain clinic for a year or more.

I waited 2 1/2 months for an appointment and initially was seen by a patient assistant who couldn't crack a smile. When Dr. Bernard came in the room he wasn't any better. My visit was all of 6 minutes. I was in and out then followed by such a disjointed (No pun intended) office staff. I need to wait for an order for my mri for
7-14 days??? Because the doctor never entered one??Stop it!! I truly felt like a piece of meat through this entire time. Yes they ofcourse billed my insurance for this office visit which I may attempt to contest due to this poor, quality of patient care.

Who votes for these patient awards that I see on his internet page? Please!! That all must be a marketing strategy. 'Making time for patient', 'Clearly explains', etc. Absolutely did not! Instead, he didn't prepare for my visit and did not review any of my history or images in Epic...instead...
disregarded my primary care doc's letter and mouthed 'injection'.

What I was expecting was a Physiatrist to take his time, come in knowing a brief history or familiarity of my charts, to listen and to clearly explain my body and its behavior through my explanation of discomfort.

I canceled my follow up appointment and intend to go elsewhere.

Please note!! Dr. Bernard and staff....
Do not attempt to reply back with any excuses. Other than replying to me that you are not billing my insurance due to this poor lack of patient care. I already attempted a second chance and spoke to the office mgr. Office is poorly run...the food chain stops here. I'm a patient and deserve the time especially, time allotted as a new patient.

After waiting a few weeks for an appointment, I saw a doctor for all of 5 minutes. She asked me a few questions and decided we needed to do an MRI as the next step. (For this, they charged my insurance over $500.) Rather than setting up my MRI appointment, they gave me a phone number to call and sent me on my way. Over the following 10 days, I called that number well over a dozen times. No one ever answered. Every time but once, I was shunted to a voicemail box that was full, followed by a hang-up. Exactly one time, I got to the voicemail box and left a careful message. A month has passed. I never heard back.

My dad had a total laryngectomy, 6 rounds of radiation and has to do 6 more again it's been 2 weeks since his surgery its bad.  3-6 weeks frim surgery he starts radiation again. They offered him antidepressants and gave him a speech about heroin treated him like addict, note hes sick very sick hole in throat now and is a mess no longer has a voice box. They don't care and are too afraid to help sad really because idk how much time left I will have him. And he's suffered the entire time. Choking on water and jello unable to breathe literally dying and he asked for 10mg of oxycodon he's 62. It's all he knows that works for him. They said that's way to much you would overdose.  I will not rant too long because I get it. It's not really the doctor it's the state threating doctor's with prison and losing power They got mad at him because he's dying sums it up.  I love my Dad more than anyone and I will get him what he needs everytime legally or illegaly I don't care anymore  as long as it's a older friend with a prescription I'll pay double the price to be safe and oddly they care more than pain clinics some great people gave me 1000mg in 15mg tablets they had from a knee replacement surgery surgery he wouldn't take money and knew my dad from union work 40 years. I thank God for him seeing my dad get some sleep and relief was the first time i felt happy in 4years of hell.  If I was rich I'd sue every person who denied him for punitive damages and lastly screw mass govt i hope your family never has to deal with this oh wait they wont you know the right people you get pain medicine must be nice|Completely unprofessional. I have to schedule my appointments every 3 months because I have to get shots for pains and they had the audacity to cancel my appointment WITHOUT calling me. I have been coming here for 2 years. The lady could not even find me in the system. I stood waiting for over 10 minutes just to be told somebody had cancelled my appointment a few days ago. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THERE'S PEOPLE IN SERIOUS PAIN EVERYDAY AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT? I am very frustrated, this is unacceptable and extremely rude that this is the treatment I am receiving. People think because someone is not over the age of 50 that cancelling their appointments without calling the patient is acceptable. IT IS NOT. And now I am forced to wait a WHOLE MONTH for a new appointment. Train your staff or just shut down the department.|Very difficult to reach someone. Leave messages on voicemail system (no one ever answers phone) and send messages direct to provided through patient site, but do not get a response that way either. How does one get in touch with doctor I am a patient of? This is an ongoing issue and in the past I have actually spent time going directly to the office so I can speak to someone. Please have a better system for patients to communicate information requested by physicians office or to make/change appointment. Thank you|The Pain Center was always great and I was well taken care of when the NP Laura was there. Since Laura left, the new person, Dr. Flores,  doing Botox and nerve block injections is a complete disappointment!  She spends more time during the visit doing paperwork than seeing the patient. I travel over an hour to go there and one day, when I had childcare cancel last minute, I called to say I would be a little late. The receptionist said it was fine and they offer a 15 minute grace period. I arrived 17 minutes late and Dr. Flores herself refused to let me wait until  the end of her day to see me for a quick 15 minute procedure.  The practice manager was no help in remedying the situation or showing any compassion for my situation. If you live outside of Boston and travel far to go, I suggest finding another place if you want fair and compassionate care.|This place is horrible. Please consider going elsewhere if you want any compassion whatsoever and appropriate care. The receptionist was extremely rude, borderline aggressive toward me, completely disrespectful, and in no way wanted to attempt to even help. Absolutely zero empathy. As a medical professional myself, the last place you should work is in the healthcare sector if you feel it is appropriate to disrespect patients and speak in a  condescending tone and raise their voice. Completely inappropriate.
I had my migraine medication approved for a year , until 2023 and nothing has changed since I continue this medication as I depend on it every month. So instead of filling a prescription for me that I have been taking for over a year now, they demand you have a follow up appt and can't book you until the new year! Oops sorry we're booked 4 months and can't do anything to help. A speciality medication that has literally saved my life I am going to wait five months to get my prescription??Not to mention this was noted in my last visit: follow-up visit in 6 months,  as needed should symptoms worsen or fail to respond to treatment plan as outlined..notice it states as needed!! I don't need to change anything and nothing as changed in terms of side effects etc. Therefore, my medication should continue to be prescribed to me! Too much red tape at the cost of the patients suffering. Also, it has only been 7 months since I was last seen, a whole month after their timeline. If you want to be miserable and put through pain and suffering, then go see them. I wish I knew how it was possible they even have patients that they are possibly booking so far out . I'm sure if they continue in this way they will lose all their patients. Good luck.|I've never written a google review in my life but feel strongly enough about this place to advise folks not to go here. The first consult appointment I had I was told because I'm transgender and the name I go by doesn't match the name on my insurance card that they would charge me $500 if I didn't jump through all these hoops within the next 48 hours to get that sorted out, even though it is a health care provider's responsibility to know how to address patients of all different backgrounds. When I actually got to go in for treatment I could not get a straight answer about insurance coverage and billing and spent 1.5 hours on the phone being shuffled to different billing departments before ultimately being sent back to the first number I called, that couldn't help me. It's unacceptable to not tell patients how much they are being charged for their care, and to not even have a way for patients to find that information out before being slapped with an expensive bill. This is the worst healthcare experience I've had in my entire life, and that's saying a lot because i'm a trans person of color with chronic pain.",2024-06-23|2024-07-22|2024-03-24|2023-05-05|2023-10-30|2021-07-27|2022-10-26|2021-05-19,1|1|1|1|2|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJkUbl4fd544kRD1T2qMijwVI,37

I've also never had a medical professional who was able to administer an EMG without pain- but he did. I was extremely terrified, but he assured me he wouldn't hurt me AND HE DIDN'T! I've had them previously and had to stop them mid-test because of the excruciating pain.

I have been seeing Dr. Mousad for 4 years now. He is the first doctor, that actually found the root of my whole problem. I have chronic back pain and fibromyalgia and I am full of Arthritis. He treats his patience with such respect, and listens to everything they have to say. This man right here has made me feel my age again. When I started going to him I was in my early 50s, but felt like some mornings I was in my 90s. I have had many different procedures in his office. Everything does  he explains everything to you. He is a caring and compassionate doctor. And everyone in his office are compassionate also! I am so happy I found Dr Damien Mousad! He is not only caring for you for your pain but he also cares for you as an individual person. I was going to him during Covid. And got Covid in 2022 October. It's screwed up my whole G.I. system, where I couldn't retain any weight and continued to lose weight. He saw me monthly and could see that things weren't well with me. I was amazed how he was concerned about my health when I was going to him for pain. You won't find a better doctor out there. He's very knowledgeable and what he does! Thank you Dr Mousad! I might not be pain-free but I am in a much better place.|Dr Moussad has treated me with the utmost care and respect.

Then it was sent in to the correct pharmacy, I picked it up, a few hours later I got a call from the medical assistant accusing me of picking up both prescriptions which I did not do as the one that was called in an hour away was canceled, so the medical assistant procedes to tell me that I am no longer accepted as a patient there.

It was determined that my back had no stenosis, and thus, all of my chronic pain was due to the depression. Ignoring details about other chronic pain conditions that have been diagnosed and verified, she recommended that I have ECT to treat the drug resistant depression and that I should stop the very small amount of opiate I am taking intermittently in order to function well enough to make it to appointments at all. She further told me that 3 years of homelessness to leave a very bad situation was ""just something one must endure"". Even a layman looking at my medical file would know that being homeless in my condition is far more than a ""little hardship"".

I was offered Tylenol, but by that point and time, it wouldn't have been enough to help keep my mind on the road. *please note, I was NOT asking for more medication, but imploring them to stop making me wait so long without word because it was causing me anxiety that I may be stuck there, which only makes the pain more intense* Then, sent me away in tears, and now I am fearful that this very small relief I get will be taken away too if because my PC is under pressure to get me off of them.
Maybe if not for the mental health problems I would have been taken more seriously, and those who do not have this problem can disregard my review in favor of those who didn't have to deal with the prejudice, but for those of you who are dealing with mental health, particularly if you and your team have stopped medications for whatever reason,  you may want to save your copay monies.
*in the unlikely event the office is tracking and responding to these, please, do not contact me. I am trying to forget this experience, and hopefully will after I post this review to warn off others who get treated like this too often as it is  and deserve a chance to avoid it in the future.|The worst  these people are at best incompetent, I can't  say  any thing  else without divulging personal info, all I will say I will not be back.|Sasa is awesome !

Dr. Feliz is a knowledgeable professional anesthesiologist specializing in Pain Management. He sincerely cares about his patients. He loves his work, which shows through his compassion. He does not take any shortcuts in treatment plans and recommendations. I appreciate his upfront truths in letting me know where I stand and what to expect with whatever option I decide to pursue in my care. At least with me, he gives honest facts. There are no surprises. He goes the extra mile to inform and treat his patients.
He treated me before and after a major spine operation. Though his office is a bit far for me to use his physical therapy a few times a week, after going to a few local therapists, I started going to his physical therapy department. Within a short time, I was standing straight, walking better, and over all, in a much better place physically then I'd been in decades!  His unwavering concern for my total health has provided me a quaility of life I hadn't had in many, many years! Dr. Feliz and his staff are great. He is respected amongst his peers, as well. On a separate note, he is an extremely devoted family man, and has a great love of life. He takes nothing for granted. And keeps an open mind. No one needing pain management for muscular skeletal related problems could be in more capable hands than those of the highly respected, Dr. Roberto Feliz!|I think Dr Feliz is a great doctor. However his office staff is absolutely horrible. I made several calls to make my initial appointment as my wife knows the doctor very well. I received no return phone calls so I had to have my wife reach out personally to the doctor to set up the initial appointment. Once I met with the doctor and I was very pleased with him and he told me I needed an ablation and a plasma injection. I told him I would get back to him in a few days which I did and got his office voicemail again. I left a message on Monday no return call. I left a message on Tuesday no return call. I left a message on Wednesday no return call . I would love to go back to this doctor but I can't help but wonder if I have any issues if I'm not going to  be able to get return calls. I have never seen anything like this. It is too bad because the doctor is so good and his office staff is so poor.|Dr. Eddy Feliz is a great Dr. But he is always in a rush and does not spend enough time with you unless you ask him too. The communication is horrendous I can't believe a pain clinic that you get the answer machine all the time and if you do get a receptionist they tell you he'll call you at the end of the day when he's finished but you never get a call and he's on call from self and in five years I called him maybe three or four times and never called back or called back I was later and I ended up in the hospital recently because he didn't call back and he didn't even call back the ER doctor so now I'm at a new pain clinic who tried to call him five times got the answering machine four times and got the reception is once and never heard and I was out of medication and that was not right. It's really sad that he should only have enough patients that he can give enough time to he runs room to room  and rushes you just to prescribe the same medication that you're on. He is a good person at heart but the last couple of years it's been different just be on your guard if you go to him . Still to this day I've never heard back from him I called every day for almost a month which is unacceptable I called him because he was uncalled for the Villa arthritic pain I was having asking if I could be on the steroids again which helped but now I find there's a whole different plan and I have more conditions that I didn't know about there's a difference the new doctor I saw went through all my complicated past medical history and knew everything about me let me talk listen to me and it just proves because he called them five times he didn't call him back it's just not professional. I'm not saying  that Boston pain clinic in Hyde Park is horrible but the communication needs to be so much better and you need to take time with your patients. Dr. Eddy Feliz did help me with my migraines quite a bit there's more to my orthotic pain then he knew . I can't say that she doesn't care cause he does but the emotional stress that I've been through the last couple months of been horrible|Dr. Roberto Feliz  has been my pain management doctor for 3 years now . He has helped me so much. When I was 27 I had a spinal fusion because of a herniated disc I had . I was left in chronic pain my pain was worse after my surgery . For a while year I suffered in pain I spend most of that year in bed because every time I moved my nerve pain would go to a 10 it was Excruciating . No one would help me all the doctors I met told me I was fine. It was extremely depressing to know your in so much pain and know these doctors who get paid to help you won't waste their time . I was desperate , I asked my lawyer what to do I couldn't take it anymore . He told me to call Dr Feliz he would help me . I called made an appointment I got in right away . He has been my life savor and I could never repay him the life he has given me back . I still suffer from pain but it is managed enough that I'm getting my life back.

So if you have searched for help and haven't found it you can stop looking because he's the best .
People travel from all over just to have him as their doctor that's how good he is .|This Dr. Feliz is a joke. Don't worry papi somebody will pay $2grand and offset the loss from seeing worker's comp patients. He's the only one around Boston that accepts the actual true rate from worker's comp. He only gets $150 thru worker's comp but if I went there and used MA. HEALTH he'd be able to charge $850.  Then he didn't like that I wasn't going to wait,as he said, up to two years to get my hips checked after my back fusion. I went and got my hips checked and I needed another surgery. He did not like the fact that I knew my body and went over his recommendation of waiting for 2 years.|Have been seeing him for over six years now,  He is the reason I am able to do the things I can today.  I have refered many people to him an just refered another today.  He is amazing in helping with many ofy problems an health conditions.  .  Really don't know what I would have done without his help six years ago.|I've been a patient of Roberto Feliz, MD for several years.  Dr. Feliz cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to try to make you comfortable with whatever ails you.  I highly recommend Dr. Roberto and his brother, Dr. Eddie Feliz.|I've been going to Dr Felizfor pain management 6yrs now. He is a great Dr. I have permanent sciatic from failed back surgery.

He strapped me down to a table to give me a cortisone shot in my spine and insisted his normal procedure would be more than enough. I felt every inch of that long needle and was screaming throughout while he kept insisting that I was just reacting to the pressure. Afterwards the nurses wouldn't let me leave for quite a while because my blood pressure had gone from normal pre-procedure to dangerously high post procedure. I wonder why? When he checked in with me I again told him my experience and he said it was hard to believe and chalked it up to anxiety. He clearly does not take women's pain seriously. My insurance company also caught his office double-charging for a whole laundry list of different things. Avoid at all costs.|I have had a consistently excellent experience with this office. I see Dr. Henkle and he has treated me with compassion and picked up on issues that other doctors either overlooked or didn't listen to me about. He has really helped me to better manage my back pain and although I'm not pain free, I am living. I was extremely impressed when he did my nerve ablation surgery - it was quick and not that painful! His team of nurses are top notch. I would recommend this clinic to any friends or family member suffering from back pain without hesitation.|I have been going here on and off for years, for lower back issues. Dr. Henkle and his staff have always treated me kindly and take the real time to listen. Dr. Henkle tries to make things as painless, quick and stress free as he can. I have been to a few other offices in the area and have not had similar experiences.|I have NEVER been treated so god awful by a physician! He clearly didn't even read my records as he stated three times how I need a rheumatologist to treat my illnesses. I told him each time I have one and he's the one who referred me. He told me my chronic pain isn't treated with pain management however I've had it in the past and my ra doctor said i should be getting them. He had a huge ego and no bedside manner! My entire visit with him was maybe 5 minutes and he shut me down every time I tried to say something! Sadly he owns the practice because unless the board of medicine which I was referred to shuts him down, he'll continue to treat patients like this. I only hope and pray he never gets struck with an illness that gives chronic pain and he may never be treated like he treats others! I drove over an hour because no one near me is taking on any new patients only to be treated so god awful! It wasn't the fact he refused treatment, I asked him what he'd recommend and he wouldn't answer, so again it wasn't the fact he refused treatment but how he spoke to me! He should be ashamed of his behavior and learn bedside manner. The fact I spoke with a patient advocate and she said she has a file of patients who've reported him spoke volumes! Don't go here! You'll regret it|Dr. Henkle is an excellent doctor. He is professional and highly skilled. He is able to work on complex cases and help patients when they think they are beyond hope. Initially I was reluctant to go to a pain clinic. Newer treatments are available here and Dr. Henkle is confident and willing to search for answers. This is the doctor you will want to be on your team. His  staff is excellent.I highly recommend Dr. Henkle.|Thank you Dr. Henkle for all you have done for me.You are a incredible Dr,I have had many procedures done over the years and I have to say you really care about your patients,You have always made me feel comfortable.I am so glad to be your patient.|Not much I can say other than wish he would of listened what I had to say other than him saying that their is nothing wrong with me I have 5 things going on with my back I felt like I was treated unfairly. On a daily basis even at night I go thru pain and unable to sleep as well and for a doctor to say he dont see anything wrong without knowing the status or diagnosis of my issues automatically he judged and has said oh you need to lose weight and there is nothing wrong just because its minimal does not mean I dont feel the pain thru out my back.|Saw me for 5 minutes had zero records didnt know me at all, was rude to me and disrespectful. Acts like every person they see is a drug addict. If l was dying l wouldn't see him. God forbid you ask a question he says your arguing. Asking questions about my own body isn't arguing its smart!

I have been dealing with pain for 2 years and after a year of playing guessing games with my PCP she finally gave me a referral to a pain management doctor. I waited a lot longer at my first appointment then I did spending time with anyone there. After quickly going through my issues I was told I would be given a muscle relaxer, a referral to PT and an MRI was going to be ordered. My medication was never filled and no orders or referrals were put through and i had to call the office multiple times to find out what was going on. It took a week to get the medication and a week to get a call to be told "" we just submitted your MRI order and your insurance denied it, see you at your follow up""

Follow up for what? Needless to say, I went to that appointment. Passed off to Stowes NP, who asked me if I had an mri, no, did I do PT? ALSO NO because no one sent out a referral / told me where i would even be going. They had the nerve to tell me my MRI was denied because I didn't do the PT. Which a letter from my insurance does not list that as the reason. I explained that the medication isn't working either and I'm still taking massive amounts of aspirin which also doesn't help. I explained I feel there is a nerve issue and was told if thats the case there is nothing they can do besides surgery but they will never know unless I have an MRI so keep taking the pills that dont work and oh, do you need a refill on them? I said if you want me to keep taking them yeah, send in a refill.....I still don't have a refill. They told me they were referring me out for PT and this morning I get a call saying the place they sent my referral to doesnt take my insurance and I HAVE TO CALL AROUND to find a place that does and then call their office back for them to send a referral and I'm booked 6 weeks out for another ""follow up"" appointment with yet ANOTHER doctor ive never seen. To see how the PT has helped for an issue they haven't even diagnosed.

This whole experience has been a joke and rather then play the game of being my own medical team to make sure i get medications and appointments booked I'm just looking for a new doctor at this point.

Dealing with the constant everyday pain I'm in is less frustrating than dealing with this doctor and this office. Save yourself time and go to someone else that will actually help you.

Edit: and after telling me they would send me refills for medication. They never did and when I had the pharmacy try to refill the medication the refill was denied. So basically I'm back to square one and i am looking for another doctor to work with because this office isn't it and i feel bad for those that get referrals here.|Everyone there is great .   Dr Stowe not good. He just didn't listen to me and kept giving me injections that didn't work. They made me feel worse.|I am a Steward employee and have been a patient for quite a while.   I will say this about Dr. Stowe of St. Anne's Pain Management.  There are times when circumstances arise and waiting time maybe a little longer than usual.  If a pain management doctor relieves your pain then he or she has done their job.  In the case of Dr. Stowe that is just what he does.  The staff is courteous and informative.  Now that Dr. Stowe will be having his services strictly at the Swansea Mall Drive facility; I hope the same service will continue.|I had been having back pain for 13 months. I had an appointment with Dr Stowe he explained what was going on with my back and scheduled me for an ESI - #boom pain gone! He was pleasant; his team was wonderful. I would definitely recommend him to anyone in pain.. #teamstowe THANK YOU DR STOWE|I love the way they all talk with you and not at you like most doctors and nurses tend to do. Everyone there is very friendly and really listens to you. It makes you feel important and that they care. Dr. Stowe has a great personality as far as I'm concerned. I always recommend him to family and friends.|The whole experience was excellent! Dr Stowe   and his team of nurses were very caring, careful, and patient with me. Five stars to everyone involved in my care during my procedure. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you!|I have been a patient of Dr. Stowe since 2003. He is a wonderful doctor! Always listens to my concerns and offers options to help ease the pain I am in. Dealing with long term chronic pain is difficult and treating it is difficult as well. I don't expect him to make me 100% pain free however he has absolutely made my life a lot easier to live with less pain. Dina Melo, one of the nurse practitioners there is amazing!!! I would see her for a primary care doctor if I could. To be honest some of the staff can be hard to deal with at times, but that is on rare occasions. Overall I am very satisfied with St. Anne's Pain center, especially Dr. Stowe and would recommend them to anyone who is in pain and needs a pain center.|I have been with St. Ann's Hopital and Steward Health as a patient with Dr. Christopher Stowe in the Pain Management Department.

I'm in debilitating pain every min of my life.  My primary can't handle the medication I need so he's referred me to this pain clinic.  The Dr refused any conventional treatments, medicine or injection because of my age. I'm a mother of 3 who can barely walk without pain never mind just sitting the amount of pain I feel.  I can't eat, I can't drink, I can not do normal daily tasks. I cannot find a doctor who takes me seriously or actually puts the amount of pain I'm in into perspective.  My quality of life is awful! I just want a doctor to hear me, see what I'm actually dealing with and help me.|Dr. Kahn is above PERFECT! I have had several Doctors in MA & Las Vegas and I have to say the Doctors here in MA are so Professional. I had a TERRIBLE experience with 1 Doctor in Holbrook/Rhode Island that was only there for the $$$
NOT DR KAHN! DR KAHN is compassionate, he listens, he is personable, he is here to treat medicine not make money. You can tell from the moment you meet him he is just amazing!
I HIGHLY suggest anyone who suffers from chronic pain, migraines &injuries this is the Dr to see!

It takes upwards of 2 weeks to receive responses from these people. When I started seeing Dr. Pearl, I was on medication that put my pain levels at a 4/10. Dr. Pearl put me on medication that made me dangerously tired (Lyrica) and eventually advised me to discontinue it. When I asked for something to replace the Lyrica, she suggested that I take Lyrica. That's not a typo - she told me to stop taking Lyrica and then suggested I try taking Lyrica. She switched my pain medication that was working to something that doesn't last as long nor control pain as well as the medication that I was taking when I started in her practice and then kept telling my doctor to reduce the amount of that medication each week. I called her office sobbing and left multiple messages. They never called me back. My doctor tried contacting her as well - no phone calls nor emails were returned. I am now at a 6/10 pain thanks to the ignorance and lack of care at this facility. Avoid them at all costs because they do not have time for you, don't care about your needs, and will make you feel worse than when you started. Shame on Dr. Pearl for calling herself a pain management specialist. You ignore your patients that you've put into worse off positions than when they sought help from you.

I've been a patient here since 2011. I go regularly, every 3 months. Hence, the 5 stars.
I may spend 5 minutes in the WR before I'm called to a procedure room. A nurse and a fellow greet you; again, under 5 minutes and the nurse is always there.

The fellow, who has finished med school + their 4 year internship with a specialty in anesthesiology,  is becoming a fellow in this specialized field of pain management. They will usually insert my medicine. The internship at this pain clinic is VERY prestigious and accepts about 8-10 people per year. It's quite an accomplishment for them and they are thrilled that they are there. One of the reasons why this program is so competitive to be accepted into is because of the physicians. They are well known in their field. The fellows WANT to learn from these doctors because of their experience and expertise in pain management medicine.

My MD is usually in the room, sometime during procedure. They don't rush me in & out! Both the fellow and my doctor will take all the time necessary with me. It's never a quick, rushed appointment.

The staff are very friendly; everyone there is. Initially, my doctor intimidated me. In the beginning,
I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay there. After almost 13 years, we have a great relationship. It just takes time to realize. As my husband initially said, it's almost like a marriage. We are stuck with each other. Again, this was almost 13 years ago.

I highly recommend this pain management center, conveniently located in Chestnut Hill.
Just my opinion.|Horrible clinic!! Doc I saw had their own agenda, made their own predetermination of a generic diagnosis, was very dismissive of detailed descriptive pages of notes, that i brought in each time, .Doc themselves spend less than 5 minutes with you but have their guru in training spend about 5-10 minutes first.When  a doc doesn't listen or seem to care, do yourself a favor, find a new one.. I did at another hospital and I am SO happy with my new pain management doctor!!!!! Best decision ever! BTW- It ends up that I do have exactly what I had been suggesting I had to the doc at 850 boylston, pain clinic, but had to suffer in extreme pain for over a yr, because they chose to have tunnel vision and not listen.|This place is a factory. One minute with a fellow, different each week with the same questions, one minute with the  physician who is uncommunicative. These anaesthesiologists know nothing about patient-doctor communication.

For many years my back had been getting worse and worse to the point several.months ago that even walking around my own house and doing the basics of daily life was really difficult, slow and depressing because I was so uncomfortable. I had been in treatment with various chiropractors and spent thousands of dollars which helped only a small amount before it stopped being effective. I have only seen Dr Kalava a few times but his suggestions and treatment program have been incredibly effective (and no.. he did not just try to presribe gabapentin and call it a day) I feel better than I have in literally years. I have always been quite active until my back and nerve pain put a stop to it a few years ago. My mood is so much better with the reduction in pain because not being able to walk, sit, or even lay down without varying amounts of pain really depressing. I don't understand the bad reviews unless they are coming from people who who went to see him simply hoping for drugs and pain meds. His approach is more full and holistic and geared toward actually healing the cause  of your pain rather than just prescribi nh your discomfort away. I realize everyone will not have the fast results I did but i have been in treatment for this for literally YEARS elsewhere without genuine results. Big positive reviews from me . I could not be more pleased and more impressed and I am so pleased to be able to start getting back to my ""real normal"".|If he can't fix you with his surgical procedures, he will let you suffer for years in agony. He comes into the appointment, and does not even look at you. His back is at you the entire time while he types on the computer.

He asked me 3 times in one appointment if I had tried Lyrica... not paying attention to my answer, and clearly not remember HE was the one that prescribed it at one point!! He isn't listening, and he isn't paying attention.

There is only a very small subset of people that are treated properly here. I called in agony, and their nurse pointed me to a DOCTOR ON FACEBOOK. You HAVE to be kidding me??

If your pain is controlled with Gabapentin, this is your savior! If you have any type of complex pain that may require some thought or action... I highly recommend not wasting your time. It will just make make your mental health worse.

I'm finally out of there, so I can be honest about my experience.|Dr Kalava was amazing  during my appointment! He immediately knew how to treat my spine  .  I was treated with kindness and respect and I cannot say enough about his staff! They are wonderful, professional and take care of any questions or issues immediately!   A definite 5 !|I really like Dr. Kalava.  He's a very busy man, doing injections in between office visits.  So sometimes there's a bit of a wait.  But he has always answered all of my questions, tried all the different medications until we found what worked best for me, and he does my injections when I need them.  He's very business-like, so he isn't into joking around.  But that's fine, as I'm only there for pain management.  I don't have anything negative to say about him, and I've been seeing him for about 10 years.  He has an assistant, Allison Friberg, and she is also great.  I find them both very easy to talk to, and I'm never left with unanswered questions.  It's five stars from me for all of the office staff as well.  All in all, I couldn't say anything bad about any of them.  I feel blessed to be a patient there.|Dr Kalava is a very good doctor. He cares about his patients. He listens to you. He will find a way to help with your pain. Very knowledgeable and explains everything really well. Staff is caring.|Withheld medication as I couldn't get a visit for the next 3 months. Receptionist said ""good luck without your pain medicine!"" Look I'm not as addict, my meds are an anti depressant that works for fibro. Horrid staff and doctor once said ""why are you here even?"" To which I replied ""because insurance makes me so I can get refills"" He rolled his eyes and said he'll get me to an assistant instead|Personally have had a VERY VERY poor experience with this doctor and his office. I have been going back and forth with this doctor for over 2 years now receiving minimal to no results. He performed an RFA procedure on my lower back causing extreme nerve pain that lasted for months and months. Have rotated through several medications some with  some pretty bad side effects, and patches that worked but not well. This doctor and his office told me they were going to try this new patch for pain....but it was coming from Michigan. They wanted me to come in for a follow up to be seen after trying these patches......I never received the patches and when I contacted the office when they stopped providing refills of a different medication, they informed me that they don't know what's going on with the patches..... How can you not know??!!!

I've gone through 2 surgical procedures with this doctor. Both times I waited for over 45 minutes past my scheduled surgery time. It was ridiculous enough that the OR nurses were visibly irritated and were vocal about it.

The communication between the staff and the doctor is very poor. I always wait for over an hour for my appointment when being seen. This doctor will come into the room, completely unaware of your case, the procedures he has performed, and will ask you to remind him. He doesn't listen when you try to communicate with him either. The staff also never seems to know what is going on. I've made complaints to the office manager with no result.

The entire experience that I have had with this office has been so frustrating it has promoted me to write this review to warn others to stay away. If you want proper pain management care you will not receive it with this office and doctor. Thankful that my primary put in a referral to a different doctor and office when I requested. Hopefully my experience with a new office and doctor will be far better than my experience and care that I have received through this office.|Called to ask if accepting new patients, yes we are. I get all my information to them, they say you should hear back at end of week or beginning of next week.so by Wednesday of following week I call and leave message, they call next day and say oh Dr kalava isn't going to take your case. I ask why they say no specific reason givin sorry we can't take your case. So I say I will be up to pick up my records,and end the call. The office calls back and says we shredded your records, so now I have to go get copies of all my records again. So I wonder when did they shred my records,they have wasted so much of my time. And I can tell you why he didn't accept my case, it's because I advocate for myself. I would never recommend a Dr that turns away patients when accepting new patients because your advocating for your own well being. Thers no reason to turn me away in 9 years I have never had a bad urine screening, or bad pill count.  A drug addict takes med's to escape reality, were I take them to return to reality. Rant over !

Recently was sent back due to shoulder damage (AC joint) and he said he would prescribe lidocaine patches and a specially made lotion. I am allergic to the adhesive in lidocaine patches but he didn't care. Then heard from the company in NH who makes the lotion and there was 3 components in it I am allergic too that he didn't bother paying attention to.

She is not only highly skilled at what she does but she is an excellent listener and very compassionate. Initially I went to Erika for a tennis elbow condition that persisted over one year. I had tried treating it through all the normal modalities without any effect. It took a few sessions of working on it as would be expected but now I can say I'm just about back to baseline and happy about it!
However, the best part was that I have had chronic left upper leg/ hip pain for 4 years that I did not expect her to be able to do anything about. however, because she is very thorough we ended up exploring this. I had had multiple x-rays, chiropractic work, etc., but nothing had helped. Erika acts somewhat like a Sherlock Holmes, she is just so interested in figuring out what's going on, she is always very thoughtful and curious in her quest to help me. Although my pain is not 100% resolved, the pain is  greatly reduced and I'm not finding myself thinking about my hip constantly. I don't have to constantly think about my movements and if the hip pain is going to wake me at night. I'm very grateful to her for this.
I cannot recommend this practitioner enough.|Erika was the only medical professional who was able to alleviate my husbands neck/shoulder/arm pain that was so extreme he would have been happy to amputate his arm.  He finally agreed to see Erika after ER docs, orthopods, and chiropractors tossed out diagnoses they had no great options for.  3 visits to Erika in the space of a week took care of my husbands pain and he has not had this issue since.  That was 13 years ago.  I recommended her to him based on my own 5 star experience where she successfully treated trigger points after I had gone down the traditional ""you have rotator cuff tendinitis and need months of physical therapy"" as prescribed by my PCP.  I recommend her to all my racquetball playing friends complaining of shoulder and arm pain.|Erika Bourne is an extremely kind, compassionate and skilled practitioner. I cannot say enough about the relief I have achieved from her treatments. I have a very complicated case and she has spent a great amount of time listening to my whole health history and putting together a treatment plan. I have had numerous injuries and accidents that have caused me to have severe, and at times very debilitating pain. After 20 years of trying massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic it all caught up with me in January 2020 and I was unable to get out of bed, walk or leave the house for 2-3 weeks. The pain was that severe. Once I started treatments with Erika I was like a new person. I have been to see her numerous times and it is a process, but I am already feeling significantly less pain, greater range of motion and I am able to exercise again for the first time in 5 years. I am actually having days where I have no pain which is something I have not been able to say for two decades.|I'm glad that she has helped people but she put me in disabling pain years ago her nails were digging into my shoulders and the dry needling went horribly wrong that's caused limited side to side up and down motion in my neck|",2019-01-12|2018-10-17|2020-06-04|2019-07-25|2016-01-11,5|5|5|1|3,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care|pain_management_services|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|good_doctors|friendly_staff|multiple_locations|injection_treatments|advanced_treatment_options,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ9XM48od344kRZBD4YCt5P-I,5

He is one of the best doctors ive ever had. He listens and truly cares about his patients. I would definitely recommend him.|I have always found Dr. Dominguez to be kind especially as I have needed multiple injections.  He takes his time to allow me to recover before proceeding with the multiple ones needed unlike my past experiences with other practitioners who rush through in an uncaring fashion in order to move to the next patient.  He has been thoughtful in his care and in offering of solutions.|Im  not entirely sure why there are negative reviews on Dr. Dominguez. It could be some people are med seeking or they are they types who are never satisfied no matter how hard the Dr. tries to relieve them of any fear, doubt or in a stupefied quandary.
I had my 1st back epidural with Dr. Dominguez this a.m. and saw him a week prior to that for an initial assessment. On both times I had many questions for the Doctor and his staff. I was well informed and left there feeling extremely satisfied and having no problems at all. I have seen many doctors over the years and I wouldn't lie or exaggerate a review on a Doctor.
This Doctor to me was pleasant, cordial, professional, Great bed side manner. Treated me with respect and made me feel like I have had him for years.
He never got short or angry with me like some reviews have said.
I will recommend him to all my family and friends should they ever need the assistance of a Great pain management /  anesthesiologist  Doctor.
I hope this will help if someone is reading these reviews and is wondering "" hmmm..is he good? Can I feel safe and well taken care of? "", etc.
Put your mind to ease. If you have questions ask the Doctor. Be completely open and honest with him and all his staff.
I have been in the Medical / Mental health field for 15+ years and have had and seen my share of Doctors who had that "" complex "" about them. Granted Doctor Dominguez is a Harvard Graduate, so that alone entitles him to respect and patients who can appreciate a man who has the background and experience such as Doctor Dominguez.
Well I hope this helps.
-Great bed side manner.
- More then happy to spend the time explaining and making patient feel comfortable
- Professional and courteous
- A dry wit, but has an affable affect.

Could go on but, I think you get the gist. If you are in need of a great Pain management Doctor, staff and organization, Saint Anne's is right there at the top.

Take care. Hope you feel better and remember, this man and his staff are well above average or good. Like I said. I am picky and very investigative when it comes to my body and who is caring for it.

This Doctor and staff are very, very good.

Dighton, Ma|Most ignorant doctor I have ever met in my life. Ill mannered and down right disrespectul. Made me follow up for three consecutive weeks accused me of using drugs when I am in legit pain from a car accident and have seen many doctors and had MRI tests which show this. He yelled at me and told me I needed psycological help- he said that was the next step. However, that is not the next step and he offered to put me on Morphine instead of the 90 vicodin a month they have me on. I do not want to be on drugs for the rest of my life I am 27 and want my life back. He was not willing to listen to me and for the second week walked out of the room on me crying. I had trigger point injections in my jaw adminstered by him twice. They only helped me alittle bit so he was not willing to treat me or discuss any other options with me and is treating me like my problems are not real. He is not a caring or nice man. It is my opinion that he is only a doctor because he is money hungry, I wish I had read reviews on him before seeing him because I have found that I am not the only patient that he has treated like dirt. I will never see him again nor would I recommend him to my worst enemy. Doctors are suppose to want to HELP people not put them down on false accusations. I will be seeing a real doctor and hope you will too. I previously saw Dr. Guptil who was always professional but does not do the jaw injections so he referred me over for those. Dr. Dominguez had an attitude problem from the start and told me I was not ""his patient"" and if I wanted to see him I needed to switch from Dr. Guptill to him. Please save yourself some time and find any other physician. Do the research he is a waste of time and if I was a man I would have punched him in the face on the last visit for the ignorant and false things he said to me.|My experience has always been great dr Dominguez always takes his time with me I've been going there for over 8 years and the nurse are great|Strung my son along for wart treatments and finally after 2 years of no result sent us to Dartmouth.

The staff was friendly and professional, and Gina and Tracy were especially helpful. They took the time to explain everything clearly and made us feel comfortable throughout the process. Highly recommend this facility for anyone looking for top-notch care and excellent service!

This was our first visit, more visits to go, hoping for the same experience.|Great friendly staff. Easy to schedule appointments. I've had 3 treatments so far and it has really helped reduce pain and swelling in my knee after a meniscus repair surgery.|I recently had laser therapy treatment, and I am beyond impressed with the results! The clinic is clean, professional, and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable. They took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire session.

I've noticed a significant improvement in my condition--less pain, reduced inflammation, and better mobility. The treatment itself was quick and non-invasive, with no downtime afterward.

Highly recommend this place for anyone considering laser therapy! I'll definitely be coming back for follow-up treatments. Love this place and the most importantly the staff make it worth while!!|I have a partially torn Achilles and I have twelve appointments scheduled. The first six helped, but these next six have really helped! I have greater flexibility and the pain has been reduced to just when I'm driving, which is tolerable. I was in constant pain previously, but can walk pain free now. Hopefully I'll get to the point where driving is pain free.|After my meniscus and ACL surgery, OrthoLazer has helped make my post-op recovery so smooth! It lowered my pain level, allowing me to focus on strengthening my leg. All of the staff are so kind, supportive, and encouraging!

I highly recommend to anyone with joint issues!|Amazing recovery from  a right total knee replacement January 7, 2025 at LGH.  I had my first laser appt  3 days post surgery.   Within a few weeks  of treatments swelling and bruising were gone. No difficulty with outpatient PT actually therapist was amazed at how well I was walking 2 1/2 weeks after surgery.  Surgeon cleared me to drive at my postop appointment 3 1/2 weeks after surgery.   This was my 2nd knee replacement the other knee (left) was done 12 years ago in Boston and my recovery was far more difficult and painful.   However this time my recovery progress was swift and painless. It exceeded my expectations.   I credit that to the  laser pain management treatments.  The staff is fantastic and the results are truly amazing.   Thank you for a wonderful experience.
Sandra|I'm glad I went to Ortholazer in Chelmsford. I've had pain in my
hip(arthritis) for some time. After having multiple surgeries for sport injuries, surgery is the last thing you want. Lazer Therapy is a great alternative for pain and inflammation. The treatments were painless and short. Very convenient. Gina and her support staff were very helpful and caring for the treatment that I needed. I will return to this location in the future if I have any other pain issues. Thanks again for your help!

They are really caring, kind, knowledgeable, and professional healthcare professionals. Dr. Lee and the massage therapist here has helped me immensely with my injury and pain issues after a surgery and general pain from bad postures. I cannot recommend both of them enough if you have complex and lingering injuries/pain issues or you would like some good maintenance for physical health.|In terms of direct patient care, I had no complaints. The massage therapist I saw on several occasions was kind, professional, and attentive to my needs.

The environment was a little strange though, with rooms that have 7ft walls (meaning they don't go to the ceiling) and paper sheets over beds. It feels much more like a poorly cobbled together doctors office than a pain clinic or massage parlor.

I went here for 4 visits via the VA Choice program for therapeutic massage and on the third visit was accosted for a tip. When I told the gentleman at the front desk I had no cash but would happily tip on the next visit, he emphatically pushed me to withdraw money from an ATM next door at the liquor store. I refused and the next visit was my last.

I have no intention of returning to this thrown together establishment that lets customer service, environment, and patient care play second fiddle to their costs and overall environment. The feeling (and I stress it is a feeling, not something I have any proof of, other than the yelling of one therapist at the owner) I got is that the therapists and professionals here are grossly underpaid and rely more on tips than anything for their salary.

I cannot recommend this establishment at all. Your money is best spent elsewhere.|Went their today for acupuncture

They did cupping and massage as well

Felt better after treatment

Think it is worthwhile, I plan to go back|It is a rip-off clinic. Because of joint problems I found this physical therapy clinic in Chinatown. After entering, I didn't even know whether the male doctor was Dr. Li or the female doctor was Dr. Li. The male doctor was only responsible for talking. Then the female doctor just started to touch me a few times and that was it. It didn't work. It cost more than a hundred  for a few minutes.

I showed up a week early for an appointment and joke with the staff after a 1 hour drive to see the doctor.  Apparently the doctor can tell dirty jokes and do as he pleases.  But I joke around in a totally empty waiting room.  That he sent me a certified letter saying he will not treat me.  I have went to him through 3 offices and have disregarded out specials recommendations not to see him because they correct his work.  Well I guess someone loyalty means nothing to Louis   I would not see him.  Especially since he can joke and you can't.  I will report this to the AMA.

He is not only one of the most Kind, Caring and Invested physicians I've ever met, his staff is treated that same way by him and it's Obviously passed on through Stellar patient care from the entire team. He always has your best Interest at the forefront. He explains things, answers questions and always takes the extra time to ease any fears or concerns you may have. I feel so fortunate to have had the proveldge to be a patient of his for several years now and he has always steered me in the right direction for my best outcome. I have recommended many family members and friends to him who now are benefitting from the same expertise and success with pain management and procedures that I have had the joy of experiencing to get optimal pain management with all of my pain issues. There is no one I trust more when it comes to my health. He's more than generous when it comes to advice, even if it's something he needs to refer you to another Dr. He will put you in the best hands as though you were his own family member. You just don't see Dr's this dedicated anymore. It's such a mixed up messed up world out there. He just eases your fears and gives you hope, answers and truth and is the first to be open to thinking outside the box if things become complex. I just can't say enough good about this Dr. He truly Cares and you feel that every time you see him.|Love this doctor and facility.

She made me feel like she understood me and cared, but then after about 3 appointments she flipped on me. I had told her I had a very long history with pain management and various treatments.  I explained that I naturally have always had a high resistance to medications of any kind even dental numbing. At one point she said to me, ""stop trying to shove your sob story down people's throats,no one cares about your past"". I responded telling her it was important to understand my past history with surgeries and pain management to be able to treat me going further. She then on a future visit told me after frustrating conversation and many snide comments that she thought I had only been on medication for a short while and told me I was an addict. I told her again my long history and reminded her why it was important to know someone's history as a dr, and that I was NOT an addict (confirmed later by 2 different doctors specializing on addiction. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. She called me a liar and that I was stupid for not knowing about a medication I had never tried. She screamed over and over that she couldn't help me anymore, that she would not help me anymore overand over and over. I asked her what would she do in my situation and she didn't even care. Keep in mind I had a 4 level fusion in my back last summer and a further surgery months later from infection from the previous surgery. So the level of pain I was in was understandable why I needed help. I asked her that if she couldn't help me then refer me to someone who could. She said she wouldn't do it and continued to scream that she couldn't help me. So i walked out crying and swearing I would never see her again. That's when I read all the other reviews on her when you search her name. Take it for what you will. Everyone has a different experience. I only say this to warn that you dont want to get on her bad side (which doesn't take much to be on).|Love the great care from Dr Wittenberg and his staff.

They took my blood pressure four times because I felt the reading was a little high and I appreciated the verification without any difficulty. The doctor spent a good amount of time with me asking lots of questions about my pain and Made suggestions for options of relief that didn't include being medicated. He respected the fact that I didn't like pills and would prefer a more holistic approach. I have a follow up appointment in one month and I look forward to seeing the progress that I make. I'll definitely follow up if anything changes, but I don't see any problems with our communication. For clarification, I went to the Dearborn office.|They were good doctors at first but after a while I began to feel judged and profiled. Whenever I had to reschedule due to me or my children being sick, which has happened quite a lot over the last few months, they would get angry with me. They would push and push for surgery and it seemed if I didn't agree they would discharge me. My home life shouldn't have anything to do with them but I wasn't always able to see them or the surgeon but I made every attempt to communicate with them, they didn't seem to care. I told them I wanted to take care of some personal things and mental health before I agreed to the surgery and once again, they got angry with me. I had to reschedule, again, due to waking up with a high fever and when I called them, mind you it's a new year, they said I've rescheduled too many times and they're letting me go, when I've only reschedule once this new year, after giving me addictive medications and not offering a proper tapering agreement, now I'm having horrible medical issues due to their decision. Also, the front desk staff laughed at me, put me on speaker, and denied information when I told them about their high fever policy and asked about their board members information. I feel their decision was unjust and I would be apprehensive about your decision to receive care from this doctor.|The office staff ladies are wonderful always pleasant and professional. The office is always clean and never a long wait to be seen. The doctors are very knowledgeable and takes the time to listen to you and explains what's going on with you. I'm very grateful to have found such great care at Dr. Hijazi office. Keep up the great work.|The staff is very kind and efficient. Dr. Hijazi is wonderful. I am weird that I like to know exactly what is going on with my procedure and Dr. Hijazi learned this about me right away and since I was awake during my procedure he communicated with me as to what he was doing the whole time. He quickly learned what his patient needed to be comfortable and complied completely! Amazing!|They were very nice at the front desk. The PA was very thorough and asked a lot of questions.
Then the Dr. came in after he had talk to the Pa they are getting the MRI from where I had it done.
He asked me to come back in a week to have an injection in my back next week. Possibly increase my Gabpapentin to help with the leg pain so we will see but I thought he was very nice.|Dr Hijazi is a very good doctor. He is extremely knowledgeable about alleviating pain. He starts with the least invasive treatment and goes from there. He listens to me and we discuss treatment options.
I still have pain, which is why I am still his patient, but we continue to work towards a pain free future. When I have an appointment, I feel that he is focused , thoughtful, listening and always thinking of how to make things better. He notices when I am depressed about my pain and gives me encouragement. His staff is kind and helpful and his N.P. Is also knowledgeable and attentive. I would recommend his practice to anyone in need of pain management.|Had an excellent experience here with the  Physician Assistant. Everything went well. I signed a new contract, agreed to physical therapy and we'll take it from there. Hopefully I'll finally get some much needed relief. Dr. Hizazi came in, tried to lower my medicine and I said no. I'm here because I'm in pain ""with"" the medication. I'd recommend Dr. Hijazi and his team, they listen to you and addressed my issues and concerns. Surgery was mentioned and I went off. For the most part I was taken seriously and I'm not getting injections. Great job team. All around good experience. I'm also a breast  cancer warrior.|Highly recommend.

Dr. Hijazi is an excellent, understanding physician who really addresses your pain needs. He had the forethought to order referrals and tests that I needed and I was called by those facilities the next day to make my appointments. The referrals were sent immediately.

Her name is Sharese & I think her last name is Johnson.
She mainly works for Dr. Masternick.
I've been under his care for almost 7 yrs & out of all the diff medical assistants that I've met during those 7 yrs she is w/o a doubt the best, kindest & most caring & efficient of them all.
She has truly been a gift these past few yrs during my journey at Insight.
Everybody at Insight is top tier & Sharese is pretty close to the top of the top tier.
She makes my appointments flow smoothly & is just always greeting you like u are family or a good friend.
She is DEF seen as an asset to the Insight crew!|Worst I've ever  ern treated by any medical professionals in my lifetime, or heard of.

Don't bother wasting your time with this prancing new shoe man an his joke of a staffers who don't care about you or your pain issues.

Leave you with nothing but finding other real professionals who do what they can to help.|If not for the circus I had to deal with today I would give a 5 star review. However, I had an appointment for Dr. Shenava scheduled for TODAY that was scheduled nearly a month ago. All of my appointments are scheduled for the same day because I live so far away and I have to find someone to drive me. He cancelled my 1:30 appt at NOON, AFTER I was already in the building (and had spoken with the receptionist in person for an early check-in) and wanted me to come back next week. I told them to cancel the appt for next week as I COULD NOT be there and keep today's appt as I was ALREADY there. They refused and told me to come back TOMORROW to see a different doctor (Dr. Rampersaud). I asked to schedule the appointment for the next date that I would be there (in November) and was told they would get back to me today and let me know. I have 3 other doctors in the building who I HIGHLY recommend (Neuro - Dr. Chaudhry, Ortho - Dr. Sarmast and Dr. Schupbach) but after the b.s. today I would definitely NOT recommend Dr. Shenava!! I am hoping to hear back from Dr. Rampersaud's office soon regarding an appointment.|This place has turned into a joke. On 9-18-24 I went in for my monthly visit and had a new dr., dr. Khan. He was so rude, and just because I wouldn't agree to let him put some implant into my shoulder, he really got rude and took me off from my pain meds that I have been on for almost 10 years. I have been going there for quite a few years now and NEVER have I been treated so bad. I think they are trying to expand their place now because they call their self a ""surgical hospital"" now. It always used to be just ""Insight pain management"".  So if you're a patient there, and don't agree to let them perform some weird procedure on you, be aware. They have always been a helpful place when you have chronic pain but now it seems that is no longer the case. He tried to replace my pain meds with some pill that most likely would have interfered with my depression and anxiety that I have had for a long time now, as well as my sleeping issue, according to the paperwork I received with the meds.
You sure can tell by the way you're treated there now days that it's ONLY about the money. If you don't let them use you for a science project so they can bill the crap out of your insurance then they just drive you away.|This is a warning to anyone who is forced or needs to come here. Don't! Find another place and avoid this place at all costs. They are not honest doctors they do not take their Hippocratic Oath seriously at all. They do not care for you as a patient or your needs,  only more ways to line their pockets. Their facility is run down, stains on the floor and every person down to the check out people are rude. I had the absolute displeasure of being a patient of Julie Winiskes and Dr. Dr. Siva K. Sripada, DO. They should be ashamed to call themselves health professionals. They will lie and do whatever it takes to protect themselves for any medical malpractice or unethical practice. It will be their word against yours. I could not begin to explain what my last years have been like with them but a stark warning..do not ever question their practice methods or argue with them for something they have done wrong. I am relieved to not be a patient here anymore! Stay away!!! Far away!|Dr. Khan only wanted to treat his way and doesn't listen to his patients. Kept pushing Botox and nerve injections even after multiple tries that made me worse. Wouldn't transfer to another Dr. Found out they have in house rule if you refuse to see one Doctor at insight you won't be allowed to see another or pick your own. Illegal.|I have been going to pain management here ever since the first week they opened the pain clinic. I have never had any issues until recently.

I was on permanent disability and between Dr. Shah and pain management they got me back to work. My arthritis has gotten much worse and I am requiring more injections. I have very good insurance (teacher insurance-messa) now they are trying to not do sedation but I thrash around too much. So now I can't schedule my appts. I have to be called and it takes twice as long to get my injections. When the injections wear off I go from 6 to 10 pain level and there is no relief. My insurance never refuses my sedation so I believe the person who does pre authorization has too much on their plate because I call my insurance company ever time and the tell me they have not heard from insight yet and the authorize most stuff same day. Something needs to be done with this and I feel they are just trying to save money by switching to oral or nurse sedation so the do not have to pay for a CRNA. Dr. Shah, Board of Directors or someone needs to fix this for the people that wants real help not medication.",2025-02-27|2025-01-17|2025-01-27|2024-10-14|2024-09-25|2024-10-25|2024-10-08|2024-08-28,1|5|1|3|1|1|1|2,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",89.6|85|79.6,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|physical_therapy|rude_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ-QHN6Up_I4gR-Y28HHWo3so,395

Dr Upadhyay and staff provide the care and professionalism I would highly recommend.|Love this doctor! Very compassionate. Makes you feel like your pain is real and truly wants to help. Highly recommended|If there is below zero I would give it to this office. The worst staff ever especially the blonde one, I don't know if she woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day but she was very disrespectful and not professional at all. I had an appointment scheduled for my dad and they refused to see us because we didn't have the insurance card with us but I had the ID number which they can find it on the insurance website but I was told that their manager wanted us to get a picture or to give the physical card. after we left I was able to find a picture of the insurance card so I called them to see if we could go back or reschedule and the blonde said we had to reschedule she offered an appointment and I asked for a different day while she was checking she said we need that insurance picture sent to us before the appointment and I was like what kind of system do have that you can't check patients insurance online and she was like no we can't and said you are all set while I was still talking and she hung up the phone I called back and said I'm still talking and she was like to me I'm canceling your appointment you can go and see another doctor and hung up the phone. I called again and was sent to voicemail and I also asked for the manager to contact me few time and heard nothing back. This was the Rochester hill's location|This was a great experience for me. Ms

Watch out for severe generalizing and misgivings without being remotely even heard as a human being still lucky to still be alive. Never read results to me so no medications should ever have even been interrupted. False play. His words were he's not there for the money as he only collected the insurance money this time. Nice one doc. I also left office with high blood pressure and no refills no concern at all. My blood pressure due to pain not being controlled and mind you he did send hospice my way. Killer much?|For working with people in pain and chronic illness, the front desk ladies are the most impersonal ladies I've met in a doctors office. I arrived at my appointment time but was told I couldn't be seen because I didn't arrive 20 minutes early to fill out paperwork. I apologized and said we had trouble getting on the road as my purse was stolen from the apartments that morning. She already had attitude and asked for my ID, I said I don't have that either but have a photo of it I could email or have my office fax it to her. She said it was fine if my office faxed it as long as she had something on file. She went back and spoke with another woman and they stood at the computer telling me he had no other openings that afternoon and to come back. He had been with a patient so couldn't ask him. It would've taken two seconds for one of my coworkers to fax over my ID and I could've done the paperwork for as long I was waiting there and the doctor wasn't even ready for me yet. I understand patients need to come with all these things and I should've called but if it was okay why cancel and make me come back? Our office sends quite a few patients here and Dr. king came highly recommended for my situation. I'm saddened his office staff doesn't seem to uphold those same standards or take 5 minutes out of their day to act like they care about patient care. I've been waiting a long time to be seen and sat in my car and cried. I didn't even get offered a Kleenex or any sort of acknowledgement on my way out. This isn't an office I would recommend if you're looking for compassion from your health care team.|Dr. King is incredibly knowledgeable and personable. He thoroughly listened and has been a champion and advocate for my unique pain issues caused from Shingles. Yeas, often times there can be a longer wait to see him but I've realized when he's met with me, he never rushes me or makes me feel like my situation isn't his top priority.  He will stay with me until I feel completely comfortable and knowledgeable about our plan of care.  I imagine he does that same level of care with all of his patients so it's worth the wait in the office.  Dr. King has been progressive in his approach to my pain.  I'm also impressed that he's able to perform many procedures in office without the need for a referral to another specialist or another location.|Update:
Dr. King called me and we spoke about the matter. I appreciate that he called and talked over the issues I had with what happened. He was very professional and even offered to recommend me elsewhere if I chose to not come back to his office. I decided I would return to his office. I have an appointment tomorrow.

I am very disappointed in Dr. King's office. On what would have been my third appointment I was running a few minutes and I called to say that. By the time I got through on the phone I was getting ready to pull in, whoever answer told me I was fine. Then someone else yelled I couldn't come. So I said I'm here I'll just come in. So I came in and they said after 10 minutes they cancel. I said it's literally just 10 minutes. I asked to speak to a manager.  I waited at least 10'minutes for someone to come out, she also said they wouldn't see me. I told her this was a follow up on injections and they hadn't helped and also the medication prescribed wasn't helping and that my husband has took the day off. I also told her the last time I was there,,there was a woman talking with another patient and she hadn't finished her paperwork and the nurse and the desk girls were saying she was 4 minutes past her appointment and the still seen her. Then they informed me I was seeing someone named Matt who was a PA and not the doctor. I was told he said no. She asked if I wanted to reschedule and I said no and asked her if she could please let the Doctor know what was going on and my feelings. I waited again and she came back and told me they still said no. I honestly didn't know if I wanted to scream or cry. Being in constant pain is hard enough, and then to wait weeks for appointments and be turned away for being 10 late and having called to tell them. I will not be returning to
Dr.King's.|The lack of communication or not calling back was bad enough, but the final straw is taking my money for a shot that I never received and only give me back a portion of it because ""you talked to the doctor, so it counts as an office visit"" it's not even supposed to be in office visit because it was supposed to be a shot so now I am out a lot of money for a waste of time for no services I have received if you're in a lot of pain, I suggest finding a different pain specialist.|Worst pain management ever. Dr. King wanted to take me off the meds that work and put me on cymbalta. Its an anti anxiety drug that isn't supposed to be taken by people with heart issues and I had a heart attack 6 months ago. It also isn't supposed to be prescribed to diabetics and he obviously didn't read my chart. I was discharged because I refused to take cymbalta then his pa said he knew my dr outside of work and was going to talk to her. That is a violation of the hippa laws he doesn't have permission to speak to anyone about my case not even my primary I set it up that way cause I have had too many problems with pain doctors. I would not recommend him or his offi to anyone worst ever|I can't believe the negative post I have been reading. I have been going to Dr. King for about 8+ years. I was actually his 3rd patient when he started. I have NEVER been mistreated by him or his staff. I have seen several pain doctors over the past 20 years, and he is the ONLY one who taught me how to control my pain. I used to be on several pain meds, but now I take 1 and only as needed. Instead of the meds, he uses different procedures to help the pain. I have CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Sydrome), which is the most painful disease you can have. There is no cure. I get urine tests frequently, and if something shows up, they talk to me with care to see what supplement I may be taking to cause concern. I have referred several people to Dr. King and will continue. Thank you to Dr. King and his staff for always being kind and professional. I'd give you a 10 if I could.|He's personable and friendly. However, if you're in severe pain Do not go here. It will be a suffering contest for you and he will question your toughness when you need compassion. My pain was so neglected I left with permanent arrhythmia problems because he questioned other doctors diagnosis. There's a vast difference between exemplary medical care and being completely incompetent.",2024-10-09|2024-10-08|2024-07-30|2024-05-20|2025-02-24|2024-07-19|2024-02-12|2024-02-14,1|1|5|3|1|1|5|1,,,"9 a.m.|8 a.m.|10 a.m.",74.8|69.4|67.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ9z45kK5lI4gRyPgl-fi3Iz0,53

Fill out the questionnaire but they never read it. I said on it I was depressed on 9 for 3 questionnaires. So they don't read them or they don't care about the patient. But when your 5 minutes late for your appointment when they had a full room of patients like the last 3 times there. They where running 45 minutes to a hr late. So don't get mad and say to them while walking out that you should find a new pain clinic. They where not bad till they moved to saginaw and the nurse practitioner took over and the doctors where doing there there prosegers in the back of the clinic.  Then they send your records to all your doctors that they make you out as a drugey. I can't figure it out that they say all that to your doctors. If I was that bad whey did I get my pills every 3 months, and there drug tests are a joke.|This place is terrible! Don't go here! They take advantage of you because they know that you need your pain meds and charge you for ridiculous things, like borrowing the books in the office. They charged me $150 for having 4 books out for six months. I returned them and they said if I don't pay the $150 I can't be seen! Constant drug screenings that insurance doesn't pay for, and don't be a few minutes late, because they will turn you away! Strongly suggest  that you not use this place!|I had been going here for almost two years seeing Dr E. He's been fine and I agreed with his original plan of care. He wanted me to go off what meds I currently was on and go on methadone. Well the last 6 months I found out I have a autoimmune deficiency disease and several heart problems which is severe. I am frequently ill from numerous pneumonia episodes, sypsis, and anemia and hospitalization. Come to find out my family Dr and heart Dr didn't think methadone was a good med for me to be switched to, so what does this place say...IF they don't want you on the med ""I want you on"" then have that Dr write your scripts. What a A!! Been there yrs and get told in a round about way told...we don't care about your health you either do as we say or leave. This place is all for injections and nerve ablation procedures on your spine which don't work and after they don't work they ignore that fact and then just keep pushing for more procedures. They make money on over Thousand dollar procedures not just a office visit to write or refill you a script. So unless you make them money they'll slowly become hard to work with and force you out. They do not care about your health and NEVER EVER TELL THEM YOU ARE UNHAPPY OR WHAT YOUR OPINION IS or they'll say we don't think things are working out here's a 30day script and find a different pain dr to see you. Funny  I've called several different pain drd and all are atleast a 6-12month period of a wait. I was in hospital w a heart attack while I'm in the ER, the nurse and office manager call me double tag teaming me on speaker ..yelling ""how dare I say im unhappy with their service and the nurse yells why are you in the hospital??? I say CRYING WITH PAIN HAVING A HEART ATTACK and the nurse in the background says oh she's gonna cry now,  they don't stop harassing me on thr phone they continue to be rude and say what I complained about to the office about after my last appointment was borderline offensive...OMG all while im getting a IV for heart meds to save me..How kind they are. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE ITS ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS NOT YOUR CARE CAUSE THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL ONLY $$$. THEY ARE FAKE NICE AT FIRST BUT YOU WILL DO AS THEY SAY OR LEAVE YOU IN MORE PAIN THAN YOU WENT TO THEM FOR!!.RUN! ILL BE JUST FINE WITHOUT THEM.|I have been going here for many years.Dr.Papenfuse has been my main Doctor here.For a long time I didn't have a General family doctor and he went above and beyond to help me..I have had neck fusion lower back fusion and much more he installed a stimulator and many treatments. When I had stomach issues he got me a general dr that found 2 bleeding ulcers. No one was helping me and he did.The staff there have always been so good.Ruby a nurse has went above and beyond also and the scheduling department has also helped with changes .If you have chronic pain these people help.Dr.Eagleson also has been great.|Was a patient here for 13 years. I liked and trusted Dr Lingenfelter and found Papenfuse competent. I loved my long term nurse Margaret and when she retired, Nicole.
I was a few minutes late to my appointment last week because I had my time mixed up, the receptionist refused my appointment and would not give me any advice or referrals even though I was begging. She condescendingly said ""no begging"".
I trusted this place completely when they prescribed opioids and told me I would need to be on them the rest of my life. I didn't ask to be on this addictive medication! Of course I'm going to become dependent on it when prescribed it for so long.
I've never once abused it and could not believe that she wasn't trained to offer some kind of help or advice when they won't see you for being late.
People die from opioid withdrawal!
I am sick, in terrible pain and miserable still, seven days later but I will not be a slave to their pharmaceuticals anymore.
They will not get another dime of my money.

Recently had multiple back surgeries and can't find a pain clinic located in the tri citys that takes my insurance or doesn't have a waiting list that you can't get on

I've been trying to go to this clinic for a few years and have reached out multiple times. When the Bay City office was open I called and was told there's a waiting list. After calling 2 years later they told me the waiting list was extended and to just keep checking back.

Before I had surgery my family doctor sent over a referral and then told me comprehensive pain specialists said they don't take my insurance (Mclaren medicaid). However, when I reached out to CPS through their website and sent a message I was told Mclaren Medicaid is the only type of medicaid they currently accept.

I sent a second email about making an appointment and never got any response back.|My provider Dr Eagleson has been a caring compassionate doctor. I am glad to finally to finally be in a clinic that is helping me find the root of my problems instead of pushing them aside. Finally I can hopefully get some relief.

There are those who pain prevents them to make it on time. I understand at the end of the day, you all have a business to run and so things have to function in a specific order. If you are going to have a ""No-Late"" policy, that's fine. I think it's deeply impersonal and inconsiderate to the patients you SPECIFICALLY tend to, but if that's how you need to run a business, sure. But don't tell someone they can ""Come on in!"" when they call ahead of time and say they're going to be 10 minutes late just to only receive a call back 20-30 minutes later and tell them how they're inconsiderate to the staff and their specialist. DRIVING AN HOUR TO COME OUT TO YOU and FOREWARNED your desk TO BE considerate and NOW you want to tell someone off? I am OVERWROUGHT with disappointment and CLEARLY you all do not have the specialty you say you have. I will never recommend someone to come here. No one who's dealing with pain EVERY DAY of their life needs to be talked to in such an inhumane way.|Wow! I had so much pain. Another clinic told me I should not do my sport again. I was very distressed and disappointed. I came to Dr. Rosenberg as a last resort before throwing in the towel. After seeing him and going to Kees for physical therapy, I was improving and able to get back to gymnastics again. I'm feeling amazing, it's incredible the difference a doctor that cares makes. Thank you Prizm Pain Specialists!|Dr.Brennen is compassionate, caring and a kind person. Would recommend to anyone suffering with a low quality of life due to pain or ailments.  Prizm has been amazing and their staff are all wonderful.|My experiences so far here have been excellent.   Very helpful staff.  Easy to make appointments.  I had severe acute lower back nerve pain.  Dr. administered two steroid shots about 7 weeks a part. Procedure was quick and smooth.  No anesthesia.  I also had PT.  I feel the steroid shots did the trick.  I feel 85% better and am happy with the results.   Now I just need to keep stretching and exercising.  Fortunately my issues weren't worse.  Good luck everyone.|After talking to the office on the phone just now, I am editing my review down to 4.  The doctor talked to me about Ketamine infusions for my pain and mentioned I should try to see a rheumatologist at my eval this morning. I called back this afternoon to confirm when we would schedule the ketamine and they said they don't want to do anything until I see the rheumatologist, which was not clear at all in the appointment. It sucks as a chronic pain patient to once again get shoved off to another doctor and know you're back to living in pain like normal.
---------------------------------
I had my chronic pain eval today and I loved everything about Prizm Pain! The staff was friendly and kind, from the front desk check-in to the nurse assistant. Dr. Rosenberg was patient and caring - he listened to all my concerns and talked about various options without judging or making assumptions. We came up with a plan together and for the first time in a long time I finally have hope I may find some pain relief for the first time in two years. I highly recommend Prizm Pain to any Fibromyalgia or chronic pain sufferers!|A wonderful staff and highly capable doctors make me feel safe and secure.

I see the owner replied, what are you talking about? We didn't talk about what to do next all he did was literally dismiss everything that was all my doctors are a joke my physical therapist was a joke and so on. His attitude was complete shyte. Rolling his eyes n so on..

Do not waste your time if you want someone to actually listen to how you feel. Especially don't go if you plan on doing something else with your day because you will wait at least an hour before they call you back and then another 45+ minutes waiting for a physician.

What happened to doctors caring about quality of life? Absolute joke...|What does Dr Tarabishy look like??? My first 2 visits I was seen by P.A. Marissa, she was very professional. My 3rd visit was for an epidural by the doctor which went fine, but laying face down I never saw his face nor did he talk to me.  NO bedside manner by the doctor or his male assistant Simon.  I was told they recently moved to the office, but not a picture or clock anywhere. Now that I'm established with this practice, if I need to go back I hope I  see improvements. Maybe even get a look at the doctor??? Ya think?|Extremely long waits i.e. 2 or 3 hours past appointment times. office was a mess from construction, the staff was friendly,  but constantly screwed up paperwork and billing . If i hadnt called insurance to see what was going on my procedure was getting denied do to the fact the office never submitted the required paperwork. the procedure room was disgusting with spilled fluids all over the floors , cabinets and equipment . You don't actually see the dr you are dumped off on a p.a. for the normal appointments.  The p.a. ordered un necessary extremely expensive tests and never followed up . when dr came in for the procedure I tried to ask some questions and he clearly didn't want to be bothered answering them .as he would walk away to a far corner of the room and answer with his back turned to me . My first appointment I encountered a patient screaming and throwing a fit because she had waited an entire day in the office "" seemed like she was seeking some drugs"" this whole office is an disorganized inept disaster from top to bottom.|Do yourself a favor if you want to see a doctor who cares DO NOT COME HERE! I repeat DO NOT come to this office. After 10 months wasted with NO  results for pain relief and also the doctor didn't show up to my scheduled appointments TWICE!!!!!

I had a reaction to the steroid used (Kenalog) in the cervical epidural by Dr. Minott.  I called the office with my symptoms:  red face, sky rocketing blood pressure, confusion. They told me to go to the ER and I did. Fast forward three months and Dr. Minott gave me another injection of Kenalog. It wasn't in my patient care plan. I didn't know she was doing it. Insurance company rejected it in the pre-approval request. Again, I landed in the ER. This time for three days. I may have had a mini-stroke. Do NOT go here. They do not write things down and the office staff doesn't communicate with each other or the doctors. Dr. Wiener gaslighted me and claimed Kenalog doesn't cause the symptoms I had. Evidently, he doesn't know his pharmaceuticals and doesn't use Google search.|Prolozone therapy

Health-wise, 2023 was the most challenging year for me. I was living with unimaginable pain for most of the year. Then, a ""Miracle"" prevailed - I have been without pain for over three months. I call ""Miracle"" the several doctors involved in my healing, each with different treatments, and I am genuinely grateful to each one.
I received  Prolozone therapy from Dr. Steven Weiner. Because of my other medical condition, I only received three treatments, which I believe did help in my final healing.
The correct diagnosis that my sciatica pain was caused by the piriformis muscle, not by a bulging disc as previously diagnosed was crucial in my healing process.
Dr. Weiner asks many questions, lets you ask many questions, and gives you the answers and advice regarding your concerns.
I highly recommend you consult with Dr. Steven Weiner at Michigan Interventional Pain Associates if you are in pain.
His friendly staff is always helpful.
Grateful,
Marina C Neves|I am so impressed with Dr. Wiener. I thought I needed surgery for my hip but after 3 treatments of ozone, I am free of pain. My other hip started to bother me so again I went to Dr. Wiener. And again, the pain is gone. If you are told you need surgery, please try this before going under the knife. It is a miracle treatment.|Dr Wiener and Dr Minott are both incredible and knowledgeable! They take their time and really listen. They offer alternative therapies and don't just push you into one option. Staff are all very pleasant as well.

Multiple pharmacies told us doctor's, especially those who practice within pain clinics within the area are will aware of the shortage. This clinic closed for three business days.

The tailbone pain has not gone away and it's been many months. She admitted that she was to blame during a teleconference several days later.

Everyone was so pleasant and Dr. Marcus(PA) was so kind, respectful, very pleasant and had great bed side manners. I which all doctor's office was like this office. Not to mention my pain and numbness was gone by the time i walked out of this office. Dr. Marcus you are a great Dr.(PA) and keep up your great work. YOU are the best ever. My suggestion is If anyone has knee, feet, or leg pain please make an appointment at Vascular Centers of America you wont regret it. PROMISE!!! Again you rock Marcus.|Very comfortable setting, with lift/recliner chairs in the lobby as well as bottled water and snacks. They provide a ride to and from your appointment.  You don't sit and wait long periods of time either. Your observation is thorough! I got a check up, which led into an ultrasound of both legs, got legs wrapped, medication and medical equipment all I'm one short visit! The doctors explain everything for you in a way you understand. I'm actually seeing and feeling results! And they don't let up on your treatment either! They are focused on getting you right! I'd recommend these guys to anyone! I see Marcus there and he is such a gentleman and intelligent too! Very dedicated in getting me fixed/healed. And Micheal, and all the crew  up front are super cool, and make you feel right at home! Definitely give them a call and schedule your appointment and ride ASAP!|I attended my second appointment at Vascular Centers of America the other day. I received fast, prompt, and courteous service. The staff was great. PA Marcus Harris did a great job of addressing my issues and concerns, as well as my test results. He provided me with a new pair of compression socks to try. These are much more comfortable than the ones I had. I really enjoyed working with Mr. Harris and the staff.|Wonderful environment, clean, excellent service. All staff are friendly and pleasant, but moreover accommodating.  They are a patient centered facility. The medical staff immediately tries to determine your issues,  without having to come in 3 or 4 times just to determine a diagnosis. They treat each patient with respect and dignity. They are a shing example for all medical clinics to follow. Also, they have snacks while waiting .|I took my 91 year young father who is totally independent and has a lot more life in him and they treated him with respect and kindness and was very attentive to his concerns . They were all very thorough. Marcus gave an excellent explanation and answered all our questions and put my mind at ease with the procedure my Father will have and I'm comfortable he's in very good care at the Vascular Center. I will definitely recommend them .|I had a great experience at this location. To be very truthful, I was really frighten and didn't quite know what to expect. The experience was made much easier for me because of the Technicians patience and understanding. Marcus Harris was especially through, and explained everything to me in a way that was comforting, and easy for me to understand. I would highly recommend this clinic to everyone that may be experiencing pain or discomfort in thier knees or legs. I felt so much better when I Ieft. Physically and mentally.|From the first initial phone call I made to the center upon arrival front desk as well as the young man who called my name I felt the warmth and friendly demeanor even the tech that did my ultrasound. Then when Marcus arrived he as well had a friendly warm personality & was quite knowledgeable and a great listener of my concerns I didn't feel like I was being rushed or disregarded explaining my situation. Oh & B.T.W  what put the icing on the cake for me was the fact they know the majority of their patients are on medication & sometimes before appointments we don't eat or the appointments are lengthy so they offer refreshments. I've watched the medical field plummet since covid & the bed side manners of Doctors as well as staff, not here I felt like I mattered & the elderly patients before me did as well. PRAYING THESE STANDARDS REMAIN.|I have been so relieved going to Vascular Centers of America. I've been dealing with pain in my foot and leg and didn't know what the problem was.  They found out the problem and since my treatments I have felt so much better.  In addition, Marcus was very helpful and explained things thoroughly in detail. I feel so  comfortable talking with him. The staff is very nice and the office is very hospitable.

After 9 months of lost sleep and difficulty walking due to back pain and sciatica I'm now sleeping well and back to normal activities. I had failed PT and injections and was discouraged.  I had heard the ads and testimonials for Pain Free Life and decided to try that rather than something more invasive. I began the 20 minute treatments 2-3 times a week around Thanksgiving and initially saw no benefit.  I was told from the start that you need to complete the series so I continued despite increasing skepticism. About 2/3 of the way through I felt the pain getting better and began sleeping well.  By Christmas I was back to a normal life. What a relief.  I completed treatments 2 weeks ago and continue to be comfortable.
The staff were all great. Appointments were on time and treatments very comfortable.  I'm a very happy patient.|Desperately looking for an alternative to ankle fusion surgery to get pain relief from severe osteoarthritis, I had read up on laser therapy.
A little skeptical, but when my orthopedic surgeon surprisingly referred me to Pain Free Life Centers, I was confident to give it try.
Though I am still in the program, I hope to continue to improve with less pain, swelling, and inflammation.
Very pleased with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff. Kudos to them for being very efficient with keeping appointments on time.|For several years, I had pain in my left shoulder rotator cuff. I saw the PFLC information as I was website browsing and decided to check it out and get the free treatment. One of the best decisions I ever made. My orthopedic shoulder specialist's recommendations only provided temporary relief.  I can't really say why I am not totally pain free, but my pain level as I write this is so much better. What makes the treatments even better, besides a staff that is the friendliest and most efficient, is that you can arrive 5 minutes before your appointment, be greeted by name and have your totally non-invasive treatment start at the time it was scheduled.|I am editing to 3 stars because I am so dissappointed that the PT department is being discontinued.  I originally went for laser treatments on my right shoulder.  They did not help much at all.  Then I started seeing Presley in Physical Therapy and the results were amazing.  I soon had no pain.  A year later I had pain in my left shoulder.  Presley encouraged me to get an MRI and when he saw the results, he highly recommended surgery.  He explained everything that was happening in my shoulder and the next week he again took time to explain it all to my husband.  He recommended the top doctor for shoulder surgery.  He worked with me before the surgery to prepare me to have a quicker recovery. After the surgery he helped me to recover quickly.  I have been to other physical therapy places and never got the quality care that Presley gives.  He truly cares about his patients.  I am very disgusted at how the Pain Free Life Center is discontinuing his facility.  My husband just started seeing him for an extreme spiral fracture in his leg and was getting great results when we were notified that the facility is closing down the physical therapy department.  I don't even know what we are going to do.  I don't trust anyone else.  Presley is the best there is and PFLC is making a big mistake and has definitely lost my business and recommendations.|I have been a patient here and even though the lasers did not work for me I know it has worked for many. Everyone has been very nice at the Painfree life center.  I had to have a 4 level spinal fusion done and came back this month to see Presley in the PT area. He is one of the best therapist I have ever had and I am so sadden that the Painfree Life centers have decided to terminate the PT department. Presley is very knowledgeable and very caring and spends quality time with his patients.  What brought me back to him after my surgeries is this.  Iona is also amazing and so sweet. I wish we as patients had more notice not just a few weeks to prepare to find another therapist.  I have never had a therapist like this and another place I went to for therapy I felt like a number and with Presley I did not. I am truly sad that you will be losing these two amazing people and the therapy dept.  I am as a patient not happy about it as I am sure many of his patients aren't either.|I started physical therapy with Presley Varghese at PFLC when I was 1/2 way through my laser sessions for my painful arthritic knees.  I am sorry I didn't start sooner when pt was first suggested. Presley presented a customized program and adjusted  as necessary to keep my progress on track. The best part of his treatment was that Presley worked  one-on-one with me, on EVERY visit, so he was always aware of my progress. He never hesitated to add(or back off if necessary) to the program. He was/is very positive and encouraging in helping clients  through some of the hard muscle work. Laser therapy has helped my painful knees, but my sessions with Presley have improved my balance, improved my core making my lower body stronger. I miss working with him. He has set my expectations for other physical therapy places/therapists very high. Thank You Presley.|I had put my back out the beginning of Oct 2024. After multiple trips a week to my chiropractor I was able to walk again but still not able to sit for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.
I had a trip planned to TX on Nov 2nd to see my grandkids and did not want to miss it. I knew withoiut help I would not tolerate a 3 hr flight to Dallas.
I had my first laser treatment on Monday Oct 28th and was told that they would have me better by Saturday if they could laser me every day that week. I had to skip Tuesday to work but was lasered Wed, Thur & Friday. On Saturday morning I made the flight to TX with no problems. I was afraid to stand up when the plane landed but I did without any issues. I was still achy but I was able to walk with no hip or back pain. While in TX I did a lot of walking which has always helped my back.
I returned home 10 days later and started my 3 day a week laser treatments at the Troy location. The staff is wonderful and always on time.
The laser has helped to strenghten my back and the deep hip joint pain I was experiencing prior is gone.
I am a believer in Pain Free Life Center laser treatments and am very grateful for their help.|I have stenosis in my lower back, I bought the package they recommended and went there diligently For all of my scheduled appointments.

Dr Glowacki is amazing. My pain literally haulted my life in every aspect. The procedure he did was painless and allowed me to return to my active life. I would 100% recommend they services offered at the clinic.|When I called to make the appointment I informed them I could not do injections due to my condition I was told that they also did pain medication so that wouldn't be a problem. When I spoke to the doctor and explained my conditions and issues he said I can schedule you for an injection, after I just told him I could not have injections. I have been through physical therapy for years and have been on pain medication for years I've tried injections and surgeries, the only thing that seems to help is pain medication, unfortunately. But if it works it works! So, no I would not recommend this place or this doctor! He didn't listen and didn't care!!|Great Dr. and amazing office.  Dr. Glowacki, takes personal interest in his patients and tries his best to resolve their problems in whatever way would work best, not just always using pain meds.

Especially if you're Cash paying. One of their employees stole $600 worth of my payments of $150 (4) different times I went. I had no idea. When I initially found out I owed money, the girl working the desk would never tell from when or give me proof. Every visit we'd go through the same thing. She told me I had to bring in receipts for every single visit from 3 years!! Come to find out I've randomly seen others that have worked there that recognized me and they told me she was the one that stole my money. I'm pretty sure she no longer works there but still be careful! The owners who wouldn't let me see the doctor the one time I forgot my card, made me go get $100 cash before I could be seen are now saying I saw them 4 times without paying!! Ridiculous! Dr. Ravi is Awesome if you do go there. I'd give him 5 stars & also the nurses. Side Note: I've found receipts of every visit except for (2). I have no plans of giving them anymore of my money. They can get it from their employee who pocketed it.|I go here with my gf who is a Registered Nurse. She is my advocate and makes sure that I am taken care of medically. This place is good in that they got me into an MRI stat. The staff and NP Brian McDermott I saw were all pleasant with good bedside manners. I am in pain everyday and it affects my daily ADL's. The NP said I may need surgery and tried to refer me to Insight which I refused. We are on the journey now of finding an excellent neurosurgeon who will further assess me and perform lumbar surgery so I can live pain free. For a Medicaid place this place is pretty good but they can improve. I will always be thankful that they got me in for my MRI right away. Thank you|Dr.M has been wonderful. I have only had to wait for a long time one time and the staff is great. He is working with me to get my pain under control and is concerned about the cause and not just throwing drugs at me. He is also the best at administering injections! Very happy here!
- It has been another year and at 44 I have finally found staff that cares for the patient and their needs. Both the Nurse Practitioner and the Doc have gone to great lengths to see to my care and have been ever so patient figuring out what will work for me. I love that they have fought my insurance company every step for me to get me the right, less addictive medication!  Everything has been quickly put through because they have stayed on top of the prior-auth process! This practice rocks and I will suggest I to all of my friends!|*UPDATE* It's been 3-4 years now and I love this place (people) even more than I did initially!! I'm in and out in 15 minutes, they're super organized and best of all, I'm treated like family.  Thank you all so much for being amazing, MMPMC!!! 
***********************************
I've only been seeing Brian for a few months but so far, I have to say the care has been far superior to anything else I've experienced over the last few years.  I've been a chronic pain patient for nearly a decade and have dealt with some VERY horrible, demeaning and just plain RUDE doctors throughout my journey.  NO ONE at Mid-Michigan made me feel like a drug seeker.  They ordered imaging immediately, went over the results with me very precisely, they were very careful with prescribing until they knew what they were really dealing with.

EVERYONE in the office has been very pleasant every time I've been there or called.  Sometimes, the wait is a bit long but, it's worth it to me because before I started seeing Brian, I was living my life out on my heating pad on my couch.  Now, I'm at least able to function and he doesn't hesitate to offer anything that may help (physical therapy, injections, etc.).

If you're truly in pain and looking for help and relief, I would highly suggest checking out Mid-Michigan Pain Management.  If you're drug seeking, you should probably keep looking because you won't find what you're looking for here within this group of professionals.|This is a great place to get your pain under control. They will work with you to get the best results. The staff does a great job and are very nice people. If you need pain management this is the place you need. 2024 The lab umed diagnostics makes big mistakes. I looked into it and it seems that there may be someone with a personal problem with me or my name because I had 3 bad labs in a row. Never had a problem until they started changing labs. Iam no longer a patient because I was discharged because of the labs. I did not take meds I was not supposed to. Also I took the meds prescribed to me and did not stop those meds. Be careful because that lab had a problem with me for some reason, hopefully it doesnt happen to you.|It is nearly impossible to get prior authorization done.  I have had to do all the leg work myself. I have been waiting 2 months for a PA to be done by the Staff for knee braces.  It's important as a patient to have

The second time it was shots in her spine. NEITHER worked. We asked them to fill out paperwork for her SSI claim. They refused to do so without her getting a test that is $650.00 and not covered by insurance. We explained that it wasn't covered so they told us to go to our family doctor to have them filled out. Why would our family doctor fill out forms on something they did? Stupid lazy people.|If I could leave negative stars I would. I was interested in coming here  to have my chronic pain illness treated,HOWEVER, after what I witnessed I hope nobody ever comes here. I heard of them through my sister.

Then  I was on the phone with her trying to keep her calm so she can at least get through this appointment because she had been in severe pain for so long waiting on this appt. After all this only to hear the attending exhibit the most horrendous behavior I have ever seen. While on the phone heard Jen come in and with the nastiest attitude begin to berate my sister as if it was her fault the office was behind and as if  her presence was a nuisance. I have never heard anything like it! This woman is UNHINGED and should not be helping patients in need.

They don't work well with me, I found with them they are just waiting for a Gacha moment, they are watching you every second of the way trying to set you up for failure, with this said, I always looked at them and respected them as a doctor, you should always be honest with your doctors, but be very careful, Honesty will get you out the door, with that said I would not recommend them to anyone.|If I could give this place a 0 I would. My appointment was cancelled twice. I was introduced to Jen by her YELLING on a personal call. I asked the MA how long it would be. She went back to asked and she yelled at her and told her I had to wait. I waited 15 mins.. I went to see how long it will be. (I've been waiting for two hours). She interrupted the conversation and began to YELL at me. Yes yell and ordered me to get off the phone. I continued w/ the appointment because I need help. I have chronic pain and was praying I would get help here. She asked if I wanted opiates before even hearing my real issue and basically said she can't help with my fibromyalgia. Patients were in an out, but not me. I truly believe she is racist. Jen has 0 bed side matter and I don't recommend her to ANYONE!

I went cause I'm out of options far as my pain. He pretty much said my pain was in my head and symptoms shouldn't be as bad as my tests. Which don't make sense I can barely walk with sciatica flare ups and chronic muscle spasms. Neuropathy in whole right side a few surgeries between my knee and ankle. I have quite a few injuries all on same side as sciatica. I literally had to be lifted off an mri bed and couldn't even dress my self that's so embarrassing. I vomit from my pain it causes sweating fever flashing severe nausea high blood pressure although I have low blood pressure which is a diagnosis for years the pain cause my blood pressure to elevate way higher than the norm. All I want is relief not drugs figure pain management can do something. I've lost lots of weight I fight my pain and injuries in a gym losing weight significantly didn't even reduce my pain. How the heck can someone tell you you're not in pain.... I never understand that I definitely never ever had a drug problem nor drinking problem. This pain makes me feel like I'm dying literally. I take care of my 10 year old. I just want relief I can't stretch no more therapy no longer helps I do therapy at home with going to gym 5 days a week sometimes I'm at gym and go in an isolated room and just break down and cry I've tried everything that most people don't to try to help myself and my health besides relying on a doctor. I personally hate medication but some form of relief would be great it don't have to be narcotics I careless about drugs I have a squeaky clean record. This was the absolute most degrading experience I have a ever received in my life..... I can't even drive in pain I can't do much myself during flare ups it's so sporadic I could be at gym or even just walking and instantly the pain locks me up and I stop.... Not being able to dress myself in pain or stand sit stretch lay down and wake up out of my sleep sweating and crying I use scorching hot water to try to get relief to the point I have burnt my skin. Epsom salt tried shea butter creams anti inflammatory I've tried everything no one can say it's be I lost weight to try hoping that would give me relief. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Do not go here if you don't want a dr to humiliate you and make you feel like crap as if the pain isn't bad enough...|All the staff at American Pain have been so kind to me, those women are amazing and awesome! Dr. Osta is great as well, soft spoken, kind and compassionate. I couldn't ask for a better pain management team...|Dr. Osta has always been kind and professional with me. He tells it like it is and I appreciate that. His help has been an absolute blessing after my health system decided chronic pain patients could no longer be treated with pain medication. My quality of life depends on this medication. Thank you Dr. Osta for all you have done to help me with my medical journey.|I've been a patient of Dr. Osta for a while. I find him to be an excellent physician. He actually takes his time with you and always makes sure that he answers any questions that you may have. I would definitely recommend him to anyone.|Just put in a complaint and I'm glad I have him on recoding violating my rights I will be reaching out to an attorney he was more concerned of what my psychiatrist was doing and prescribing me my fiance was in the room and actually had to restrain himself of the way he was screaming and speaking to me . I attempted to contact office manager he Osta takes phone and gets to yelling more and hang up . I have put a grievance with my provider also I have contacted Laura . I see there was a complaint left a month ago , I wish I would have seen that before stepping in his nutty ssa office no one discharged me it was my first and last visit so to have a interaction with a patient questions your response to my review he also replies to everyone review I have screenshots and recordings and have submitted them to the proper departments. Good luck|Dr.Walid Osta ,is a great doctor. he talks to me with respect and concerns about my health.and his staff is very kind and i will continue to be his patient for five more years.Thank you Dr. Osta.Annie Griffin.|This Dr Walid Asta is a flat out disgrace. I feel awful made the mistake of looking this place up for my husband. He is a vetran and is 100 percent disabled. He has permanent injuries to his body from serving. He attends physical therapy and sees his dr regularly I was suggested a pain clinic for him since the steroid shots physical therapy nothing is working.  This dr accused my husband of falkng his identity faking his injuries from the service when we brought all of his diagnosis AND VA paper work which shows all of.his ailments and compensatations. He also had all his diagnosis from his primary care dr and even offered to bring up his henryford mychart info but this dr did not want to help him he insited my husband was lying and had 0 proof of being In pain and said it sounds like he has anxiety my husband was there for pain he has a left hip femoral acerubulae impingement which means his left hip basically is stuck popped out so he's in pain always. Even sitting. He barely csn make it to work he also has severe connection for left knee  patellafemoral arthritis  so to walk is very painful.His physc. Dr handles his anxiety but this dr wanted to use that his anxiety was why he is in pain????  This is a pain clinic right??? So not only this dr mistreat a US vetran he doubted his pain doubted his identity basically accused him of lying said his paper work was trash. If that's the case how are you able to treat any patient??? It's disgusting the way he was treated. But you made sure to write him a script for SUBOXENE??!!! Now that's a fraud, suboxene is for opiod addicted patients trying to recover. My husband first of all is not a opiod addict and second of all was there to to seek help a second opinion maybe thinking he needs surgery nowhere did he ask for a script of any kind..with that being said I see exactly what's going on at this place. If you look the part of what this dr thinks you should look like you will get help. But if you are an outsider or don't look the part even with all the proof he will assume your asking him for drugs and maybe even write you the script but only if you look the part and he ""believes"" you. Well my husband came to you for help he served this country and he's 100 percent disabled and in pain every day he didn't even ask you for a script and you treated him like a criminal.  You are whats wrong with this country and our health system people like you are the reason why so many live every day In pain or why so many end up in the streets. I made the mistake of choosing this place for him, and am so disgusted with how he was treated. It's just wrong. Good to know you are recklessly writing people scripts for subkxene but you claim you don't have any proof of their ailments? You contradicted yourself and you show you pick and chose who you help. He came for help he brought everything  and could of even checked his henryford mychart you chose to judge him instead. You don't deserve to be a doctor.... Period. Oh and your little pre written response doesn't change the fact of what happend it's all facts and the proof is all there so it doesn't make a difference what you wrote back and by the  looks of your reviews that I just took the time to read you only help certain types of women and Arab men which furthers proves my statement.

Adding more,this  doctor is mad about this review and has called.my husband leaving voicemail yelling at him! What a  psycho!! How  are people like this even allowed to be Doctors!??? From what I read and this experience  this doctor gets mad when people call out his shady unprofessional behavior and then he threatens or gas lights them...and violates patient HIPPA patient rights.......pathetic.  Maybe stop blaming the people who come to you for help and Adding to the response you just flat out lied because Dr didn't know I was on FaceTime the whole appointment while my husband was seen and my husband or myself is not a liar. So go ahead and put on your little dog and pony show. Your  lying your dr is lying and for that now I will never take down this review|I have been going to American, Pain and spine Center for many years! I love the personal treatment. Everyone there makes me feel like I am family. The girls are so kind.  Dr. Osta is very thorough.  I recently went through a terrible tragedy in my family, and Dr. Osta, was incredibly compassionate. He made me feel heard. I moved pretty far away, but I make the trip out there every month, and I will continue to do so, forever.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

They have been nothing but caring, kind, helpful, and truly concerned about how I am feeling. When you are in pain finding help can be difficult and frustrating. I would highly recommend this office to anyone who is ready to be heard. My treatment here is truly appreciated and sincerely respected.|These people are completely incompetent. My mom has been trying to get a shot there for a month. She completed all of her pre work and when she showed up for her appointment they said they did not have her MRI.

Second visit the left her in a room for an hour only to tell her that she could not have the shot because it was not scheduled.

Third visit same story.

Don't waist your time and money here.|I am not one to usually leave negative reviews but I have to agree with all of the recent negative reviews. I called 3 times without anyone answering. I randomly received a call back several days later. Individual I spoke to on the phone was very short (rude). I explained what I need Ed and she scheduled my appointment. She scheduled the appointment wrong and it wasn't for the procedure that I thought I was getting. She didn't explain that I needed a doctor appointment prior the procedure appointment. It was a complete pain!
The doctors are great and do amazing. They just need help in the front offices.|I used to see Dr moessner she was very nice but Jen the practitioner she made you feel like you were after drugs only not the pain so I left that office I would never recommend this office|I'm sorry, but, it is only fair to correct my review and be  honest even if it hurts me with my doctor and he gets upset with me. I  changed this review to a 3 star and thats pushing it due to the receptionist actions with me and how I'm spoken to. I wrote this review 10 months ago and gave a good review when in fact i should of spoken the truth; to the community I apologize, but I was afraid to make my doctor mad at me but the public deserves the truth on how the receptionist treat me at the Intervention Pain Clinic. I've been having some problems with the receptionist dating my prescriptions on Sundays when my pharmacy is closed, and my pharmacy calls the receptionist to let them know they're not opened, the receptionist tells my pharmacist oh well I have to wait until Monday that they will not change the day to Saturday when in fact that would of been my fill date. also the receptionist refuse to honor the 2 day before I'm out of medication window to fill my perscription. The receptionist service is not  excellent, its bad and sad they're rude to me when the doctor is not around, and then there is Jen the NP Nurse Practitioner whom makes me very uneasy from my very first visit with her the tension was so thick I wanted to get up and leave. Jen the NP made me so uneasy the way she would eyeball me as if i was a liar. I pick up vibes with ease and sense strongly and from my very first visit with Jen the NP I sensed she didn't like me so I requested to never, ever  be put on her schedule again  and she would try and walk in to see me and I'd say sorry I'm seeing Dr. Halajjian,  thats when the receptionist started messing with me and my dates of medication refills and my appointment with Dr. Halajiian being either way to soon or a week past my refill date. Also,  as I'm waiting to schedule my next appointment Jen comes out and whispers something to the receptionist i feel it has to do with my next appointment, Because I end up calling to reschedule so I  keep it on my right track 2 or 3 days before I'm out of my medicine, not a week early or a week  past due, heck, I even switched office buildings so I did not have to see or pass by  Jen the NP's path ,but low and behold she ended up coming to that office too. One appointment Jen walked in and I said, sorry, but I'm seeing Dr. Haladjjian Jen said, well your seeing me your on my schedule I said I asked not to ever be put on your schedule and was forced to see her that day; I was very upset, uneasy, uncomfortable feelings I dislike. I told Dr. Halajjian he made sure that I'm not seen with Jen again shew. I knoticed that the office isn't crowded like it used to be although Dr. Haladjian is a good doctor his receptionist need retraining and on my next visit I will talk to Dr.H and  I hope he listens to me my words when I try to explain and  complain about the receptionist. I've yet to find a doctor like my primary Dr, Dr Steve Atallah , Dr. Steve is now retired, but he will always be my #1 doctor. I was Dr.Steve's patient since I was 18. Dr. Haladjian is my pain management doctor I've been his patient now for 6  years. If things don't change and how I'm treated there are other doctors I can see. All doctor offices should treat patients with respect too. Doctors swear an OATH to, do everything in their power to save lives and heal the sick when possible. Doctors swore an oath to help keep a human life  comfortable as they leave this earthly realm. To help their patients to the best of their ability with kindness and compassion. To  care for a human life is a big responsibility because, we the patients put our trust and our lives in the hands of doctors to whom God gifted them with  the gift to  heal. It  is  God's hand that touches the hands of the doctors guiding it all the way from start to finish, healed.  So, in saying that doctors should be all about healing, helping, listening,  with empathy, caring, and compassion. Dr. Haladjian is a good doctor its the staff that need to check themselves, for without patients they wouldn't have jobs, Truly.|The only way you can talk to Moesner is by appointment only, even after procedure, that didn't work. Made appointment still didn't get Moesner, got someone else.  Just want to talk to MY doctor with so many questions. It's easy to feel like a burden there. I tried to call but always told to leave a message, got call back over a week later. Don't like leaving post like this one I'm frustrated and not sure what next move should be. I recommended this place to someone else, sorry for that!|Dr Moesner is a wonderful physician! She is kind and truly cares about her patients. I first went to see her many years ago after multiple cervical and lumbar surgeries. I was very much at the end of my rope. I wanted to have an internal pain pump implanted.

After I posted some concerns in reviews about his change to Grand Rapids Pain Javery decided to retaliate against me on two separate injection days. I've always supported him in the past but now that I know more about why his practice has changed to GRP. I don't think anyone should trust him. I no longer am his patient by my choice. I've found a fantastic new pain clinic and it is so much better than Javery's clinic.
Shame on Javery for deceiving many patients. $215,000.00 was Javery's fine for sedation Medicare fraud. This insurance Medicare fraud could be a huge reason why pain patients cannot receive sedation anymore.|I was at a point where I'd have normally considered myself to be a little overdue for my regular procedure, based on my prior treatments from abotjer doctor that I also very much valued, but because of the effectiveness of Dr. Javery's prior treatments for me, my condition didn't deteriorate nearly as quickly and my pain was manageable enough until I could get in again for another cervical steroidal epidural injection procedure that, after only a few of these procedures performed by Dr. Javery, I've had so much more lasting relief and improvement in my overall health and wellness and my daily life in general. It's been very surprising to me how quickly effective this procedure has been each time he's performed it for me - literally giving me instant relief. I always have my procedures done without any anesthesia due to my own preferences, and they are always very quick and relatively painless for me (literally only a moment of pain given in exchange for many months pain-free), but the instant relief from them is a God-send and I couldn't be happier with my care under Dr. Javery's hands.|After a car accident and suffering a neck injury in 2022 Dr Javery treated my pain, after several appointments I made the decision to have a Spinal stimulator implanted. My relief after surgery was immediate, reliving 80-90% of my neck pain and I regained almost full motion. Would definitely recommend the ABBOTT BURST STIMULATOR to all those suffering from chronic neck or back pain. Dr Javery and his staff are the best!!!|I saw Dr Javery for more than one area of pain. He was so thorough in his questions and exam. He suggested more than one avenue to pursue, going forward, and explained the options very well! I worked with him over 20 years ago, and now as a patient I appreciate his wealth of knowledge and expertise even more. I have great respect for him and look forward to being able to be more active once treatment begins. I'm grateful for pain doctors who care, and sort things out, because pain patients are not all the same.
Update:
I just had another injection recently, and my experience exceeded my expectations. Each staff person identified themselves immediately, I didn't have to ask a name. They were kind and reassuring throughout the process, as always.

I received excellent care from the staff, as well.
Thank you Dr Javery and GR Pain. I know I may never get rid of all my pain (though hopefully some will be alleviated), but I'm on track for a better quality of life again.

The thing about a doctor so smart and skilled, is he never stops trying to learn more and become more. That's a win win for all of his patients. He stays on the cutting edge of what's available without big invasive surgeries. Yet he doesn't push you to do what you aren't comfortable.

In between injections, I saw Veronica, NP. She will take the time to explain things clearly, and also let you voice your concerns, then offer clarity. That is what is needed to alleviate concern. I appreciate that. And her assistant, Amanda, is so kind and helpful. I will note it takes quite a while to get injections scheduled and is quite a process.|FYI... Rereading this post I realized some of my date's were wrong so I've edited it to correct them.

I moved to MI in 2016 and started with Dr. Javery soon after. During my 1st, 2 years in MI, my mother developed Dementia and was also hospitalize 5 times in 8 months, passing away in 4-2017. Also, during this time I let my brother move in with me twice, but because he was an addict, I kicked him out both times. Soon after he OD in 9-2018.

My morphine pump, which I received in 4-2011 (after trying everything available, traditional and non-traditional, including a 3 level spinal fusion in 2006), was set at 3.5 mg/day on a continuous feed. When I move to MI, after a 3 year long battle to divorce my husband, I had been on Adderall for 9 years and Klonapin for 8 years (about), but no doctors up here would continue my care.

Being off Adderall, I ended up sleeping up to 16 hours a day. So, of course I thought ""got rid of my ex, got rid of the stress, so my pain levels decreased"". So I asked Javery Pain Clinic to try turning it down, thinking I'm doing the RIGHT thing. Wrong! I actually got down to .6 mg/ml a day, but the final setting was 1.2 mg/ml daily.

As my mother got sicker, I had to move around more, so hurt more. Of course the stress increased my pain levels (stress outside my control), so I asked for my pump to be increased. I was told to see a psychiatrist. After 20 years of 24/7 pain (1998-2018) I finally broke. I started planning my suicide.

I survived and after treatment, when the nurse came to fill my pump, she actually switched it out with saline, then said I'd have ""mild"" flu like symptoms. Seriously! Total BS! I was told to get my head straightened out, then I could come back. No way in Hell would I every go back to him. Doing (what I thought was the right thing) just ended up letting them torture me.

After being on morphine from 4/2011 to 3/2019 (8 years) I had massive withdrawal's. Ended up in the ER 2 nights in a row (where they couldn't help at all), and was in hell for a week. Finally, my other brother, who is also a addict, got me some Suboxone (which is used in rehabs I'm told) to control the withdrawals, because the hospital and doctors couldn't help me. A doctor needs a special license to prescribe Suboxone I've read.
If I had the energy to sue them, I would.

Being off Adderall, then Morphine messed up my life so bad (so much for being happy after my divorce). After 25 years (10 in MI), I've just heard the term 'Continuity of Care"" and with my psych records (which I've had since moving from Atlanta to MI) finally started back on Adderall. Which has enabled me to start getting my life, and financial affairs, straighten out.

I'm looking into a new pain clinic to start getting morphine again, because I can not lay in bed, in pain for another 5 years. My weight went from 170 lbs. to 340 lbs., I developed type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, etc., just because the doctors in MI wouldn't continue the medication that I started in 2007 (Adderall) & 2011 (morphine pump installed)  to control my pain and other health problems. So yeah, I'd rate Dr. Javery a ""0"" if I could.|I had a great experience at the Grand Rapids Pain Clinic. Dr Javery and his entire staff does a wonderful job of communicating with you, explaining everything that's going to be done during your procedure and talking you through it gently, because some of these are delicate procedures. I strongly encourage people to get an appointment with the Javery Pain Clinic in Grand Rapids.|Dr. Javery is a charismatic DO. who gives you time to ask questions and concerns about your personal wellness. He gives you information on your procedure and realistic outcomes for your specific situation.
Dr. Javery and Dr. Juneja are an incredible pain management Duo!!

I also have great respect for the receptionist and nursing staff.  This has been my 4th year coping with my issues concerning my pain management along with my supported outcome. Lastly, the follow~ups with the communication staff via e-mail and text have been a lifesaver and encouragement. Insight  Surgical Hospital has been an amazing  asset to my stages of recovery and wellbeing.|The only empathy I have been graced with has been from the nurse and the woman that called me over the phone. Doctor and PA are cold and bedside manner is non existent. I had an order for an MRI due to having severe swelling and severe pain after a procedure they did, I tried to schedule it and left voicemails w my info  and so did they - we played phone tag. Even if we had touched  base - I had to get X- Rays before the tMRI for some reason...IE wrong CPT codes IE I am post op not pre op.. On top of all that - My husband and I  had a death in our immediate family out of state, from my last visit to this one. So yI hadn't had the MRI and I didn't know about any X-Rays til the day I was there for my appt. Instead of increasing my pain meds  due to severe pain  she decreased them. Her reason- I didn't get MRI yet! I tried and have proof as I left all my personal info on VM.  And a death in my family !!!! Out of state! They already have copies of my MRI from a year or so ago showing my Lumbar fusion and post Laminectomy Syndrome- recent MRI order was to show what was damaged after last procedure they did. This it's s completely unreal to lower my meds because I had an out of state funeral and didn't get MRI before my next appt-  and have proof I tried to schedule MRI as I left multiple vm's. I have repeatedly told PA that I cannot live in level 10 pain. I have no quality of life . I've asked for procedures, stimulators, or even surgery to no avail- Decreasing someone's meds because they had a funeral and because office never called back after I left vm's is unacceptable! Lastly, I couldn't wear these patches anymore because they were burning and scarring my skin and giving me rashes and itching- so she gives me a new script that requires a prior authorization so I'm still waiting for that to be done so I can pick  up those meds. Meridian said could take 2 weeks so office said they'd put a rush on it to make it high priority- it's the weekend now and I'm still in agonizing level 10 pain. I am a human being and we have modern medicine for a very short amount that I reason . I should NOT have to suffer like this ! She  never should have lowered my meds knowing that this could take weeks! Obviously I need more of the other meds until these are filled!!!!! No sick and suffering patient should be left to being bedridden when there are meds out there to ensure people don't suffer. Thank you|Every time I go it's always fast. The staff is awesome.

Very satisfied with their care and results in treating sciatica.|This has been by far the worst medical treatment I have ever received in my 62 years of living on this planet. I had a procedure done on my lower back by Dr Matthew Kuiper in August 2023 that caused excruciating pain soon as I left the office. Once I got home, I called them and explained to that I was in serious pain. To my dismay, they told me to take a Tylenol, which I did but that did not relieve my pain. I went to sleep in pain but when I woke up the pain was gone and my back felt much better.
Fast forward to July 2024. My stem cells grew back and I had to have that procedure again.  I explained to the nurse and Dr Matthew Kuiper that without any pain meds just for one day, I don't want the procedure. Dr Matthew Kuiper agreed to write me a prescription for pain.
Just like last time, the pain was immediate. I went to my Walgreens to pick up the prescription but it wasn't sent. I called the pain clinic and they told me that he hasn't written the script...that he's with another patient, that I may need to wait a few hours.
So their idea is for me to leave there in pain, go home in pain, wait until he decides to write the prescription, get back up in pain and go back out to pick up the prescription.
Someone please make that make sense!
Had I actually took the time to read the horrible reviews this place has received, I would not have came here in the first place.
I'll never go back there again!|Who orders $250 worth of food and tips their delivery driver not one penny? Terrible people woth low morals|Dr Wild and his staff are absolutely amazing!! I have now had 2 injections at this clinc. They are always so friendly and welcoming, from the moment you walk in the door all the way to recovery.  You can tell they are busy but always give me the attention and time I need. They are very professional and helped to relive any anxiety that I had prior to my procedures. Dr wild walks your through every step of the injection and tells you what to expect.  Dr wild has truly given me my quality of life back. I can now do house work and play with my kids pain free!!|Always wait for 1 to 2 hours for injections. If I didn't need to be here I would walk out with me Mom. She is elderly and is already in pain and this just upsets her.|My sister has serious neck pain from EDS.  She has had multiple procedures and her neurosurgeon recommended she go here.  They won't even do the recommended shots for the nerve pain and when she asked for oral meds then because she's in excruciating pain THEY COMPLETELY DISMISSED HER!!  First they said they only do shots but then won't do the shots in the area she actually needs!!   However they also were EXTREMELY RUDE to her for asking for any other medications!  Would never ever recommend this place.  They are cruel, incompetent and only want money.  They will not help you no matter how you are suffering!|Terrible office staff. They were incredibly rude when I was first trying to make appointments which was a nightmare with all the back and forth they were giving to my PCM. Finally made it to a couple of appointments and scheduled the next for a Rhizotomy. Then they failed to get the required insurance approvals on time. My appointment was cancelled less than 24 hours notice. I had been without pain medicines to prepare. Scheduled Rhizotomy again. Yet again, they failed to get the required insurance approvals on time. Less than 24 hours notice of cancellation and in excruciating pain from going medicine-free to prepare for procedure AGAIN. You couldn't PAY ME to go back to this clinic.|I had been a patient here for close to three years. I was so happy to finally have someone help with my sciatic nerve pain. Dr. Bez started giving me injections right away, not only for my sciatic nerve but also some in my low back. I would come back every 3-4 months for more injections and every time it seemed like he had to keep doing more and more. After over 2 years of constant injections I ended up having a horrible experience. The pain after the injections lasted longer than ever and I ended up with zero relief!!! When i went back to tell him about it he automatically jumped to the conclusion I was asking for narcotics. I went ahead with injections 2 more times after, he told me he knew what to do differently and they would work. Both times they maybe worked 20-30% and only lasted a few weeks at best. This time I went back to see him knowing I'm pretty sure I do not want to try injections again at this point, I have the names of two medications, (one oral antidepressant used to treat chronic pain and one cream) to ask him about just to see where my options are. As soon as he begins going on about injections I stop him and let him know I'd rather not and try to ask about my other options but I cant.... he bursts out yelling about ""no such thing as a magic pill"" again assumes I'm a drug seeker and tells me he wont ""give me what I'm looking for"" then tells me hes writting to my primary doctor about this... I could hardly get two words in! At the last 3 appointments with him HE has brought up narcotics and how he won't give them to me, but I have never once then asked for them!! Of course they work and if things were different I would take them, but that does not make me a drug seeker. Had he given me 2 minutes and actually listened without interrupting I could have showed him the paper I had the names of those other meds I planned on asking about. My low back / spine burns constantly since that bad experience months back. Something went wrong, he knows it!

I should have gone with my 1st instinct when the nurse asked me why i had to use catheters. I told her it was the pinched nerves in my spine. She lauged and said who told ya that. I said my neurologist at the MS center. The head nurse doreen spent all of about 3 minites talking to me. The main issue i wanted to address was severe neuropathy foot pain. I asked about a spinal.cord stimulator and she told me that she thought that would be tbe best thing for my neuropathy and after that she would address my hip pain and other areas. Well the stimulator disnt help at all for the foot pain and when i went back doreen blamed the stimulator company and told me to go back to the VA and ask them to help and give me a drug that ive been taking for 20 years and they should know that. She didnt even bother to crack ny file. And why should she? Shes getting rich off the hundreds of patients coming through!

Again why would they? Thats the problem with our healthcare system in this country...its all profit based!!! I dodnt trust doctors and nurses  before this and fkr aome reason i started to think maybe i could but now i KNOW i cant.

Dr. Ferro has helped me tremendously.|For some reason, my original REVIEW has disappeared... probably because it ripped Dr. Ferro's OFFICE employee's to shreds...and RIGHTFULLY SO!
Ferro, as a Doctor is GREAT. However his office personnel are terrible!
They never return calls, even when they tell you to get back with them to set up an appointment. I left messages for 6 months straight, (once a week, on multiple extensions, once I realized the ext I was told to use, seem to have no one ever listening to the messages.), asking, then begging them to please let me set up an office visit, or whatever it would take,  to continue with what Dr. Ferro had started...nothing ever came from those calls.
Not one call back.
Finally, I told my referring Doctor about my problem, where he said, he's heard more & more stories similar to this about Ferro's office... and he finally referred me to another doctor.
It's simple, I just want to walk again. Ferro saw my problem, stated he could help me out... and due to his personnel incompetence, I was left with more problems...
To me, that's just mean, and nasty... and totally unacceptable!
Thanks for getting my hopes up, only to let them fall to the ground & crumble. RUDE!

KGilson~|This office saved my life.  I have a very painful rare disorder called Trigeminal Neuralgia. I went to many big name hospitals and was told they couldn't help me.  My neurologist sent me to Dr. Ferro. I was ready to give up on everything.  Living in my bed was no life. With Dr.  Ferro's help I was able to get out of bed a few days.  When the cervical spinal stimulator became an option he told me about it.  It changed my entire life. It's not a cure but I can say I have more days out of bed then in bed now. I feel human again.
His staff is to notch.  Kind and caring.  I highly recommend him if you have pain they will do everything they can to help you. I love Dr Ferro and his staff.|I love this Dr I got my life back, I could not even bend over when I came in. Great bedside manner!|I have to change my review. I have been trying to contact his office for about 8 weeks. I received 1 call, got the order for x-rays 3 weeks ago. We hand delivered the x-ray and have not heard anything, his practices for contacting patients is the worst. I am so much disappointed. Now looking for a new pain doctor. I am an established patient since 2020. Good luck on being contacted.|Dr. Richard Ferro is a truly fantastic physician.  He is caring and compassionate as well as extremely knowledgeable and skilled in the management of pain. He has done more to reduce my chronic spinal pain than any other physician or treatment has been able to do, and he's enabled me to manage my pain much more effectively.  All of his nurses and staff are equally wonderful, all are genuinely compassionate. I always feel in good hands in his practice.|Great pain Clinic  just long drive.Dont understand  why he put me on  stronger meds than my GP doctor  he sent me to Dr Ferro  have one roller coaster off  ride 7 surgery's in a year have pain pump needs  service every 3 month to big  for my anatomy Dr's words so it sets in at angle after two surgery's  so it rubbes on the muscle on left side of spine has leads that run up  spinal fusion to upper back trickles narcotics  down  spine eventually  absorb in to tissue don't do that much for my back mostly takes care of the pain in back pump if it fit properly would be lot better out  come, kinda off a oxymoron to me but just heavy equipment operator not doctor.Have to drive from west side off Battle CREEK  Mi drive  up there once a month to pick up script or have post dated so don't have to make drive. On right side I have Tenses unit with  leads  that run to ribs that where unnecessary  removed by Thorasic  surgeon  that has moved am working on legal action that is another story, Suprising  the  tenses unit gives  alot more relief than exspected.My only complaint is ask if he could change my pain pills not increase they where giving me acid reflux and to strong so was prepared for decreasing  amount  big mistake  he took me from 20mg Oxycodone  to norco 7.5 mg big drop  even person  filling  my pump agreed with me had fell down  and hit right side and back still swollen so my pain level was higher so sent me home with steroid  for swelling working good so far but my pain  level  has not changed told him may run out of meds can't get my pain  under control guess if run out off meds   go emergency  room? Or go to Veterans  hospital suside watch lost all my quality of  life either in fog from narcotics  or in the worst pain ever!|I have been with Dr Ferro I think for 11 or 12 years now.  He's been amazing.  When I went in the beginning I was not sleeping but a couple hours a week because I had a really bad sciatic nerve issue.  I truly miss Dr.  Ezzo , he was the counselor that I visited every 2 weeks, he was very kind as is Dr. Ferro.  It affected many of terribly when he passed.  The office staff had always be kind to me and helpful.  During the pandemic they have been understanding of my autoimmune issues and my fears of coming in last year.

I felt Dr Drelles really cares about you as an individual, and not just another patient. He was very thorough and answered all of my questions in a manner I could understand. I did not feel rushed or that I was taking up to much of his time. He explained in detail several options that he could provide me to help with my pain. I actually look forward to being a patient and seeing what he can do for me. Highly recommend this office!!|I have seen Dr. Drelles For a long time, eight years, I think. He is a wonderful doctor, very caring, very professional, and listens to all your complaints. I have gotten many epidural injections from Him, and he has the magic touch! They are practically painless! All of his staff are very well qualified and very kind. I could not ask for better care than I have received from him and his staff.|Very unprofessional....continuously disregarded my feelings on the way his nurse practitioner NICOLE constantly disrespected me. I begged Dr. Drelles to please stop bringing her into the room for my appointments because of her behavior and attitude towards me. Dr. Drelles told me they were a team and so in a cowardly act he discharged me! I  was very much so disrespected on both ends him and his nurse practitioner NICOLE!  I brought this to the attention of the  person that ran the hospital  and to  no avail...nothing  came of it other than me being discharged! This happened over a year ago...I  left a comment  however  it seemed to be missing  so I left another one to express my disdain. This was at STRAITH HOSPITAL!|Dr. Michael Drelles has been my pain management Doctor for several years. He is very involved every step of the way with determining my next step. He encourages patients to call him with quesitons and I never feel rushed.

His team are all very helpful. A special shout out to Stephen Harris, Keenya, Brandi, and Chris for taking my pain and questions seriously.

I recommend anyone to the Straith Pain Center. I felt safe and the facility was extremely clean.|I've been coming to See Dr Drelles for 6 years for my pain management. He's knowledgeable on the new technology and always recommends it. His office staff is friendly, they make me feel comfortable and I will continue to come here.|Yesterday was my first appointment with Dr. Drelles. He is an amazing doctor. He sits and talks to you about everything and makes sure you understand. I am so happy that I found him. I finally feel like I'm going to regain some quality to my life and my toddlers life. He is very aggressive with treatment and wants to make sure that you're as pain free as possible. He is running tests that have never been mentioned to me after dealing with a bad back for 10 years. That fact that I'm so young is even worse because I still have a long way to go, but now I can confidently say that I have some hope for the future.|He is like no other Doctor. He truly cares for his patients. He wants them to feel better!
I recently had a fall which resulted in a T5 fracture. Dr. Drelles called me and we talked for 45 minutes about my options. I have never had a doctor do that before.
He is truly a great person and doctor!
Thank you Dr. Drelles!|I have been seeing Dr Drelles for a complicated pain problem. No other Dr has been able to care for me like him . He from the beginning of my care listened to me and didn't treat me like I was drug seeking.  He has made my life so much better. He is kind knowledgeable  and giving to all his patients.

The new dr saw my pain meds (originally prescribed by THEM) and drew conclusions before reviewing the test results HE ordered (CT scans).  His ""treatment plan"" would not include any med refills only injections.
Ive since seen surgeons and found doctors who care and am doing much better.  This place??...?? Only wanted to push injections ...you draw yourself own conclusions. I give them one .|Horrible experience with receiving bilateral facet steroid injections. I was initially told I would not feel ANYTHING during the procedure, nor would I be awake for it. Turns out I was both awake, and in excruciating pain. I asked them during the procedure why does it hurt so much, and their response was ""to hold still, it's almost over"". As I'm looking at the xray machine and seeing the needle inserted in my spine. I had Horrible pain for months after the procedure that felt like I was being stabbed in the back with those needles repeatedly.

On top of all of this, they injected into the wrong sections of my back. My problem areas are L5, S1 (pain on right side, imagines show problems on the right side), and they did L3/L4/L5 on the left and right sides (6 total injections) So 4 of them were unnecessary/in the wrong spot. I felt zero pain relief and worsened pain after this. I went twice in hopes of it working. They had the nerve to recommend epidural injections since the facet injections were ineffective.

Do yourself or your loved ones a favor and DO NOT COME HERE.|The staff is very empathetic but appear afraid to aggressively attack pain.  I've had multiple injections of cortisone preps to little avail.  My pain levels have only increased including partial paralysis and numbness.  Without resolution, I fear that I'm becoming bed and wheelchair bound.  Additionally, it's near impossible to navigate their phone system and I believe it's on track to be unreachable.  Callbacks are not effective.  I protect my phone against telemarketers and won't answer unsolicited calls.  Thereby, I receive no calls.  On the whole, the personnel making decisions are weak while the subordinates are excellent.|As someone who has been through the ringer with work comp, the staff here have been amazing. They listened, came up with a plan and for the 1st time in 3 years I feel as close to ""normal"" as I ever have.

They just do not care about helping with pain.  They would rather stick you with needles and collect their money.  It doesn't matter if you keep telling them it is NOT working.  This is unethical and immoral to leave patients in pain as they do.|I'm not one that normally goes to the effort to post my experiences on my proceedurs however I just need to give praise where praise is deserved.

However trying to schedule appointments or even just getting ahold oh his staff is next to impossible
After several attempts to call and get my 5th injection scheduled, I am leaving the practice due to no communication from his staff
It's incredibly frustrating|First I'd like to say that Dr George is great, He has helped me with my chronic pain in my back and ankle. 5 stars for him! On to his staff, these folks are awesome! From the receptionist to the recovery, all of them are amazing. They listen to you and treat you with the upmost respect. They deserve 10 stars!
These folks actually care about you, that's something that you don't see these days. Highly recommend.|I have been going here for almost 9 years now. Back when Dr Zapada was located at this practice. Thru Dr Wright, Dr dobritt, now Dr George. I liked Dr Dobritt and tried to follow him when he left and went to Novi. I Had an appointment at his new office but when i showed up they told me Dr Dobritt  had a ""Non Compete Clause"" and couldnt work there, very strange, i tried to find him but no idea where he went from there, no idea where he is practicing today, so i went back to see dr george,  Glad i did,  I have lower back pain and down the back of my left leg from an injury and surgery 30 years ago. Tricounty has done a great job managing my pain with a combonation of steriod injections and medications. Its always a plesent experiance from the moment i am greeted by Uganda at reception to all the great PAs right up to when i see Dr George. Uganda upfront is so nice very friendly and extremly helpfull.  I highly recomend Tricounty Pain if you are a suffering from cronic pain.|Many Doctors but not one quite like mines. Dr. Wisam George of Tri-County Pain Management. Words CANNOT express how Dr. George have helped me. 4 grueling years of PAIN day and night I suffered having Lower Lumbar Spinal Stenosis until........ Dr. George heard my cry for RELIEF. Drained literally from pain.

A Special Thankyou To Uganda for showing Exceptional Patient Services what a Beautiful Personality and Rocking the Front Office !!|I don't understand this office. I was here in 2017 and left ASAP due to scammy business tactics and rude staff. I then went to MIPA and was a patient of Dr. George there for about 4 years.
He left that practice and moved here. I want to continue seeing Dr. George, so I called last week to schedule an appointment. I was told the first available appointment is in June.. which is 6 months from now.|This place went from great to horrible! Dr. George is good but the staff is beyond horrible!
First of all I couldn't walk due to a back issue. We asked for a wheelchair. They brought it to the car and wheeled me in. Then made me walk to the furthest exam room. Then I was going to get an injection and they wanted me to walk into the surgical room. I wasn't asked to change! I was in street clothes. Nothing covering hair and shoes on!
The doctor hit the nerve and I was in excruciating pain! It took forever to inject ladocane which did not help.
The staff was extremely rude as I lye there in pain crying.
I went home. No one followed up. I was scheduled for an MRI the next evening! I went and they never received the orders! The doctors office was closed and the answering service would not help me. I went home and scheduled it again myself and called the office. They insisted that they sent the orders. I had them send them to the new appointment place. On that day I called the place and they had not received the order. The doctors office is closed on Friday but someone answered the phone! I had them send the order's again! They still insisted they had!
I made another appointment with a different doctor in another practice and he ordered my records to be transferred. It took 5 phone calls from me and several from the nurse to get it done!! Stay away from this office! Horrible does not come close to what I experienced! You were warned!|I was referred to Dr. George by another pain doctor. I absolutely love him. He's kind and takes his time with you, he doesn't rush you out the door. I'm extremely happy with him and his whole staff. The office is very clean and everyone takes covid precautions.|Best Dr I can't say one bad thing about him I'm very up front and truthful with him from day 1 and I always give him all my other drs updates and he's the only dr since I broke my in 2000 that will sit down and talk to me regarding test or if I have any questions and he never Rushes me out the door
I've been with many dr and had many surgeries with more to come and he's very patient with me and never pushes to have any treatment lets me take my time

This is the only doctor's office I look forward to going to. Not only that the professionalism is outstanding! I thank them for helping me to live a good quality life with minimal pain.|Love, love Dr. Growney!  He is compassionate and very knowledgeable.  I will admit it is difficult to get a hold of staff on the phone. Seems like they could use a full time triage nurse to answer phones, not quite how they work the system. Also do often have to leave messages regarding front desk, but they do call back. Have been coming here for about 8 years and won't leave due to Dr. Growney! Using Patient Portal is helpful for messages and refill requests.  Many meds can now be prescribed electronically for 3 months. Big help there. In spite of the phone contact hassle, staff is always kind and treats me well, so still a 5 star rating.|I'm a paraplegic since 1996 and I've been going to Michigan Pain Consultants in Holland and Grand Rapids locations well over 10yrs. I've been to many doctors and this is the only one I look forward to going to, I feel comforted going there. The staff is AMAZING, the doctors are SECOND TO NONE!!!!!!! They have treated me for more than pain, I suffer from PTSD from the first Gulf War and they've helped with that, they've helped lower the amount of other medications I was taking, they truly care about their patients. Most Dr offices/clinics are ""money first, patient second"" but not here. I know they put ME FIRST before money and I won't get into specifics but please take my word for it, my health and we'll being come first!!!!!! I really love all the people working at these clinics, they're like family.|I had my final appt today at The Holland/ Mi Pain Consultants. I felt like was going to a funeral. I started 20 years ago with Dr.Growny/ now Dr.Nemeth. I am incredibly sad with the situation. Every person, from front desk, nursing staff, people in the procedure room(sally) and of course, Dr.Growney  and now Dr.Nemeth, have treated me so well and with such compassion. Some things worked and some didn't, but they worked on it until it did. I cannot say enough how great all these people were to me. I feel like I lots some good friends.
Thank you for your care and kindness towards me. You will be missed.
Diane Storey|If you have CHRONIC PAIN...  get a referral to Michigan Pain Consultants.  I personally know how Chronic pain interferes with life, relationships, jobs, friends and more.

Dr. Gao and the rest of the team at Michigan Pain Consultants have profoundly improved my chronic pain.  They actually understand what pain does to a person and they have many more 'tools' to treat it than your Primary Care Provider.

Their approach has been methodical and measured.   But most importantly, they've taken time to understand what I was experiencing and applied a variety of methods to improve my personal situation.  We've made more progress in the ~ 9 months I've been a patient there than in the ~10 preceding years at a variety of providers outside of Michigan where I previously lived.

Prior to their working on my issues, I had been treating the issues with ""STRONG"" pain meds...  To be sure, Michigan is much more challenging (frustrating) to have and maintain access to such ""STRONG"" medications - but hey, that is on the state not the Doctor's office....

Once that was sorted,  I have honestly been truly surprised at how effective their treatments and approach to chronic pain management has been.  Their treatment regime has made a fundamental difference in my life...  and in what I have been able to do and take on.  Even though I have pain...  it's SOOO much better today...

In closing - Pain is horrible.  Dealing with insurance can also be horrible.  But I truly believe that Michigan Pain Consultants knows how to navigate insurance and Michigan regulations - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY has multiple tools to diagnose, treat and manage pain.|They gave me Cushing's Syndrome, and kept pushing for more steroid shots. Even after my endocrinologist faxed a letter.|I have been seeing Dr. Nemeth at the Holland location for about a year now and he has been such an amazing doctor, he is caring, very knowledgeable and will not stop until he finds the absolute right treatment for you. I would definitely recommend him to anyone. The nursing staff is amazing, the wait time can be a bit long but that's with any office you go to especially when unexpected situations occur.|I have been receiving treatment at the pain clinic at the Holland branch for five years now, at least four times per year. The team of staff are superb. They provide their patients with exemplary service. They go above and beyond to keep their patients comfortable and satisfied. I love the fact that Dr. Growny is very personable with his patients. He remembers and ask about topics we discussed in previous visits even when they're not health related. I would recommend this pain clinic to anyone who desires quality service. Keep up the good work Michigan Pain Consultants you rock.",2017-08-21|2019-07-02|2024-03-18|2024-06-21|2024-04-02|2017-11-29|2022-10-15|2016-04-25,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|5,,,"9 a.m.|1 p.m.|10 a.m.",76.8|66.8|65.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Is this office closing down",Yes...sadly,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJjVLOqvPyGYgRSQZUtkzQB00,81

I've been a patient of his for nearly 10 years. When I had insurance he insisted on injections three times a year now I have no insurance so I pay cash for my visits. I had an injection in my hand but refused anymore in my back. They do not help. I swear the pain is worse.
I cannot describe how angry I am, this office claimed I had cocaine in my system back when I first lost my insurance and just yesterday they claimed I had no medication in my system. So they refused to see me anymore.

But he is friendly and he has given me a different view on injections without anesthesia.|Dr Hussain is a pretty good doctor. In my opinion, the Staff is the Best. They're very courteous, respectful and very knowledgeable. This includes the Nurse Practitioner. I like her a lot...

Apart from APC being convenient for me to get to, I like the fact that you don't have to be concerned about Riff-Raff standing outside the building, or sitting in a vehicle out in the parking lot, waiting for patients after they've left the building.

I've never been approached by a person, or persons trying to sell pain medication, or wanting to buy pain medication. At some pain management clinics, that seems to be a real problem.

Since prescriptions are sent digitally to the pharmacy, that eliminates these issues...|The people that work here are very nice. Dr hussain has a lot of patients, so we need to have patience with them too.  take the time to ask questions if needed let him know what is working and what isn't. get to know them before judging,  then write your review|I just read today how numerous Michigan doctors were convicted for insurance scams by demanding patients have injections and if you can't have them then this doctor does just like the 13 who were charged and given prison time and ordered to pay back millions to insurance! I couldn't safely have spinal injections due to a rare blood clot disorder. I take daily injections of low  molecular heparin. This doctor threatened to take away my oral pain medication numerous times in between seeing him and his PA's. The day he said he was going to take my pain medication away I then agreed to have the injections (chronic pain makes it difficult to survive and have any quality of life) so I agreed. I was then given a pamphlet that said if you are on a blood thinner you must not take it 3 days prior and three days after the injections. When I demanded the doctor looked at my previous medical records that explained the seriousness of my rare blood disorder, he took it out on me, stopped my oral pain medication that day without giving me time to find another doctor or any kind of solution. I know who I'm calling and reporting this clinic to. This is the exact practice the convicted doctors in Oakland and surrounding counties were convicted for! Shame on everyone employeed at this clinic! If you need pain control go elsewhere. I have a feeling this little gig is coming to an end!|I have been a patient of Dr. Aman for approximately a year and a half now and Dr. has performed procedures on my back with great results!

Then they reported to his PCP that they prescribed pain meds that they haven't and that they were taking over his pain management so PCP was not to prescribe any pain medication while tells us that until my friend completes the Behavioral Health assessment for pain meds to get them from the PCP.  Behavioral Health had yet to return our call to schedule the assessment.  Any message left has a response that it could be 24 to 48 hours to get a call back.  It's been over 48 hours and NO RESPONSE.|I've been seen on time for all of my appointments.  I was told that my 1st appointment would take two and a half hours.  I planned accordingly, understanding that this is a medical office, and was out well within that time frame.  The staff and my doctor are friendly and excellent to work with.  I would recommend this office if asked and would bring my own family here.|Poor patient care, head doctor is very rude. Nurses will treat you like you are a herorin accident. Save yourself the trauma they put you through and choose a other pain management clinic.|Appointment times go way over your scheduled time, this is a facility for patients that are in pain yet you make them wait ungodly time frames while sitting in the chairs that are unconfortable. We have been here for one appointment and it took 3 and a half hours before we we out of there. This is 2018 ,you should know how appointment times go, you should be able to have an idea of how to schedule your patients. I offered to have you call me prior to an appointment and was told we can not do that , you have to stay here because we do not take them in any order? Then why do you schedule any one if you do not have an order you follow. Dumd founded here. Would NOT recommend this facility to anyone suffering from pain. It is painful for me to watch your patients in your waiting room waiting so long for a service that you are being paid for. Staff don't seem to care and some are rude, one told us that she does not make us come here so we need to not be rude.She said sit were ever your most comfortable and we answer there is no place that makes me comfortable.|TERRIBLE!!!!!

EVERY SINGLE TIME you end up sitting for 2 hours waiting to be seen! Schedule for 2:15 today and here it is 4:18 and they just now brought a gown in for her. Whenever we say something about how long it takes just to get seen they reply ""we're a little behind today"" NO.... your problem is you over book and understaff everyday, every week, all year long. You tell peole if they're 15 minutes late for their appt they have to reschedule but you expect them to wait, their ride to wait, children to wait, for 2-3 hours minimally every appointment. You Schedule people so theres someone waiting in every room as your Physicians leisurely walk around and go at their own pace with no urgency at all.

Our very first visit people in the waiting room said this was what to expect. We took it with a grain of salt as people can make things sound worse than they are. NOPE. They were being nice with how they put it compared to reality. We take her in for a single pain injection. Takes them literally a few minutes once they get into the room to give her the shot... Absolutely unacceptable to wait 2.5 hours before they even get in there to give the injection.|Very pleased with the team I have with my pain control. Very friendly staff. The time waiting is total worth the out come. Been going to them for awhile now and never had a bad experience.

At every appointment she had, the doctor arrived to work over an hour late OR they would tell her that she had to come back in a couple hours despite having an appointment. They refused to prescribe pain medication without her having another appointment despite having been seen recently. They also scheduled her for physical therapy before ever having a consultation to go over results of an xray and CT scan, so they had no idea what the problem was and were planning to do treatment based on nothing. She later went to the hospital and found out her back had a very old break which damaged the vertebrae. This facility did nothing to help her.

Extremely unhelpful and would not listen to anything I said.

Do not use this office if you actually want care.|Dr. M. Sabbagh has been my doctor for many years. I absolutely love and respect Dr. Sabbagh because he cares about, and listens to his patients concerns about their health, to try and come up with a feasible game plan that you are comfortable with.

If you are reading my review, please look no further and schedule an appointment with him, you truly will be pleased.|Dr Sabbagh is the BEST Doctor that you could ever ask for when it comes to helping his patients.
I have been suffering for 6 years with   Chronic pain from a auto accident. If it wasn't for Dr Sabbagh understand what I needed to get through this all I don't know what I would have done!!!  BEST DOCTOR EVER!!!|Dr. Sabbagh was very helpful with my back issues. He explains his entire plan of action he has in mind for you. He starts with treatment that fits your pain level and doesnt stop until he finds something that works for you or after he has exhausted all his options. He explans each step of the procedures before and DURING the procedure. I was extremely pleased with him. Unfortunately he had to refer me to a back specialist for he had no options left to treat me. I advise going down there to make an appointment or to speak to anyone in his office.  They wont answer the phones n when they do they put you on hold til you give up.   This review is for the DOCTOR. NOT FOR THE RECEPTIONIST. Unfortunately the doc is getting less stars because of his receptionists. I GIVE DR SABBAGH A 10 !|Office staff was so nice, and patient, the Dr sabbagh was amazing he totally wants to make everyone have the best quality of life. He listens and explains everything. So glad I was reffered to him|I, Sharlene Gant-Greer, was referred to DMC Sports Medicine Group after ending up in the emergency room in late July or early August of 2017 because I could not walk more than 15 steps without terrible leg pain. Shortly after that, I received a diagnosed of Degenerate Disc Disease /Stenosis, within a month after that I had my first visit with Dr. Mahmoud Sabbaugh on September 1, 2017. Dr. Sabbaugh explained my MRI while showing me the pictures, and a brief explanation of how surgery might be able to make me more comfortable but it is degenerate. I was devastated and I am still devastated as today I cried in his office (again)! Again, I received nothing but encouragement from him.

The plan:  Physical Therapy (very low-impact stretches) 3 times a week and at home the other days, for six months, I completed that!  Next: Three injections 30 days apart, the first two were great then the third one was not so good. I fell apart (boo hoo) in his office (again)! I still received nothing but encouragement from him.

Next suggestion: We can try the an implant for pain, I was for it until I found out I had to be off work 6 - 8 weeks that's surgery time why do that twice! Even then, he was supportive and referred me to a surgeon that he highly recommends. About 6 - 9 months ago, I saw the surgeon and his team and I was very comfortable, but clearly not ready for surgery. I have seen Dr. Sabbaugh every 3 months since, nothing but supportive. However, today I informed Dr. Sabbaugh that I am ready to go forward with the surgery, and I will call the surgeon and make an appointment. Oh and did I mention he has the best nurse ever, Connie, she is always there and supportive she was there for every one of my injections! That is my experience with Dr. Mahmoud Sabbaugh.

Thanks to all of you for being so kind and genuine about the care I get.|This doctor does not like and is scared now of prescribing pain medications with the two new government laws passed this year (2018) and only his two female RNs will if injections or a small surgery doesnt work for you!!! I dropped him immediately when he would not increase my schedule 6 narcotic, (tramadol), do to it wasnt doing anything for my pain. So i asked to have it increased to see if that would help i was told no. I then new and had terrible insurance prior to being put on the tramadol but was will to bite through the financial issue and ask just to be put back on my schedule 2, (percocet), that i new worked great. He had his assistant call me and tell me he took another look at my most recent MRI and he sees no reason to continue nor do i need any pain management. Well the last surgeon almost 3 years prior wanted me in for a immediate secondary fusion surgery of my lumbar spine. I was told by my old pcp and a couple more spinal surgeons that my lower spine will only get worse not better do to the several issues i have going on with it. I will have to remain i pain medications for the rest of my life i recently brought myself to that conclusion, so i can continue to provide for my family working many hours with a very physically demanding job i cant get out of just yet. I have been exercising, conditioning and slowly get back into strengthening mybody especially my abdominal area to help with my back. After dropinng this individual as my pain doctor i thought my new pcp most certainly would have prescribed my percocet. That was until my pcp was told by this pain doctor that i was abusing the tramadol. I was disgusted that this pain doctor lied to my pcp and in return my pcp took his word over mine. If you want help for legitimate chronic pain where only narcotics are the only option after all other treatments you've tried have failed- DO NOT SEEK HELP BY THIS DOCTOR!!!!!|I very much enjoy the staff that works here.

I take 3 pills at night of muscle relaxer 750 mg each and two of the nerve blocker 309 mg each but okay I will try.he said he would call in a prescription to make sure I had enough of the muscle relaxer pick prescription up it's for 500 mg so email office the nurse email me back and tells me I've been taking 500 mg for the last couple of year so I send her a picture of my prescription and a picture of my list of prescription for the last year all 750. Get email from doctor apologize for this saying it was a mistake he will call in for the 750.

The nurse I talked too was very short(not sure if she is having a bad bad or what) I asked why my previous mri results I got from another dr was not shared with whomever read my current mri. She became very mean, talking to me like I was beneath her and did not know how the medical industry works.telling me its not in the medical industry for drs to share previous mri results to new mris unless they where done by the same facility(which I know is wrong and a medical malpractice suit if something is missed)I did fill out a medical release form the 1st day at my appointment in 2021 so that southern michigan pain consultants would have all my records from the dr I was seeing in indiana which that included the cd of the mri in 2021, the paper which that dr wrote up about my mri, and all other medical records.

I appreciate him so much. I guess I was foolish to think I'd get the same professional treatment from Tom.

Not only did I get no relief, I've had deep spinal bruising, steroid flush and lower back pain from this disastrously botched procedure for more than two months.

Despite a visit back to see the nurse and multiple calls with their office manager, there is ""nothing they can do about it"" and that this is just something that happens and I should schedule another appointment. No way. There are better doctors that won't hurt you. Don't go here.|Been going there for 6 years. Doctors and all the staff have been outstanding. I complement them when I leave.|My sister, who has been addicted to pain opioids for over 30 years comes here. Unfortunately in October her colon ruptured due to constipation from Norco abuse and now has an ostomy bag. This was all due to the amounts of Pain pills she was given after her 5th back surgery. Imagine a script written for 5 Norco pills a day for a month. A month script of 150 pills! This is not what I call Pain Management. It's aiding an elderly addicted senior.|They gave me the wrong medication. I had a consultation with the PA and let her know that I don't handle steroids well at all but I've had kenalog (triamcinoline) in the past and it worked well. I let her know that I had a bad reaction to dep medrol and that I cannot tolerate that medication at all. She said that makes it easy for her and the Dr and she would order a kenalog injection for my back pain. I went for the injection and was not informed what medication I was getting. I was just told it was a corticosteroid injection. I assumed it was the kenalog since that's what I was told at the consult appointment. After the visit I was walking to my car and the pain was getting worse and worse. By the end of the night I could barely sit or stand up or do anything other than lay flat on my back. I began to feel nauseous but have horrible food cravings, developed a bad headache and my scalp and jaw line had broken out in hives. The following day I checked my aftercare sheet to see if it had any info and it said I was given the depo medrol injection. I called the office and they gave me a number to call and complain to but it still doesn't fix the problem. Most of the staff were very kind less the initial nurse I saw before I met with the Dr and nurses in the injection room, but kindness doesn't fix that I was given a medication that I specifically said I cannot handle.

Returned for a follow up visit and met with a nurse practitioner who was extremely dismissive of my pain and blew me off, told me all I could do was rest and brace my back.. which is what I have been doing for years. I have exhausted all other treatment options, that's why I'm at a pain clinic. This place is hands down the worst medical experience I've ever had in my life so far.|yesterday afternoon i received an injection for pain.  i had a different doctor, that i gave a hard time  (not really hard)
But today i feel a million times better!  Sorry I don't have the Doctors name...   but i feel so much better *****
Thank you all, doctor and all the ladies who took care of me!
Shirley Julin|I am very surprised at reading the negatives reviews. I've been going to this location for about two years and have had nothing but good experiences every time with nurses, doctors and office staff. I've never been made to feel like I'm a drug addict and I feel as if the doctors really do believe and understand (as much as they can) my pain. I've utilized their psychological department in the past and even those doctors and staff treated me with nothing but respect and empathy. Even though there isn't much that can be done for my pain except the current treatment I'm under, I appreciate that they have always had a patient ear while I talk about my pain, and have made various suggestions of things I can do to help me stretch the hours between dosages so that I do not take more than I should.

I now need to update my review because in the past three months I have had terrible experiences with this clinic, especially with the PAs. They are not managing my pain nor showing any empathy. I have proven to them over three year's time that I do not abuse the medication but when an incident occurred recently that greatly increased the pain I have been experiencing, putting me in the Emergency room three times and admitted to the hospital twice, they accuse me of being an addict. Of course I am addicted! One cannot be after using the drug over a period of time. But I am not an addict in the manner they present it to me, which is an insult. I do not take the drug for some quick high, I take it because I have pain. So I am highly disappointed in the clinic and am considering finding a new pain management facility.|I have been getting lumbar injections here for a couple years. The worst part is the office problems. First of all, I've never called an office that is so anti patient as this. It's almost impossible to get someone on the phone to make an appointment. The staff seems to feel that they are more important than serving their patients. HOW COULD IT BE THAT NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE????  People today are very mobile and most of us work, so it may not be possible for them to call you whenever their little mood strikes them. Yesterday I called at 10:55 and never got a call back.  This happens every time I need an injection. One time I just called and called all day to see if anyone would ever answer. No one did. Another time I pushed another button and got someone from another area and finally got her to get someone. How does this place even stay open?  Also a certain member of the office staff is very rude and always seems to try and talk me out of injections.  She tells me I will regret getting this now because I have a certain amount of time left in my 6 months cycle and even lies telling me my insurance is changing and it will be 8 months now. This was never true.  I reported her to the office manager with 2 instances of rudeness and she ended up covering for her.  I do like the doctors, but it's hell on earth getting past the endless bureaucracy and laziness up front to get to them.|This review is for a visit I had in September 2019.
For about 8 weeks prior to my visit I had been suffering severe pain as a result of some spinal issues. Bulging discs and spinal stenosis produced pain so severe that I couldn't walk or stand for any length of time. My quality of life was greatly affected by this. I was determined to get relief and thought this place would help me with that. After all, it is a ""Center for Pain"".

In reading all the reviews I can understand why they are mixed. Some had a good experience while others did not. I learned that, after going here just one time, the experience depends on who you are seen by.

I believe that most of the staff here are compassionate and caring health care professionals.  In my first and only visit, I had the misfortune of being seen by possibly the only staff personnel who is the complete opposite.

The first two staff members I encountered were pleasant. But then I was seen by a physicians assistant. His callous attitude and belligerent behavior left me feeling that I would not get the proper care and treatment I needed.

Needless to say, I did not return there to get the epidural injection I was scheduled to receive, nor for any additional treatment at this facility. My decision to not return there was based solely on the way I was treated by just one person there.",2024-07-15|2025-01-29|2024-07-23|2024-02-22|2023-11-09|2016-12-09|2018-05-24|2019-12-12,1|5|1|1|5|5|2|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What's the dr name","I am aware that this question is a year old but wanted to do my best to answer it in case either you; or others in our community, are still in need of an answer. This practice is a collective of Doctors of Anesthesiology specializing in Pain Management. As well, there are NPs and PAs. Unfortunately, there are only two to three providers within the practice that are willing to consider & utilize any modality of treatment to assist in the alleviation of chronic pain. The majority of the practice is only willing to provide injections. Injections are a gift when effective but sometimes a multi-modal approach is required to achieve optimal improvement in quality of life. And; yes, sometimes opioids are an appropriate supplemental option. If you have insurance and are searching for competent and compassionate care, I would recommend this practice.

During my apts he was professional, patient, thorough, respectful and interested in gathering all evidence before proceeding with any procedures. He was not eager to perform surgery and instead wanted to make sure the timing was right and the primary issue was first addressed. He listened to my concerns and input. Is is definitely not ego driven. I would definitely recommend Dr. Sukumaran to family and friends or anyone in need of his specialties. There is no doubt I will continue seeing him when necessary.|THIS REVIEW IS A MUST READ!! I have been seeing pain specialist doctors since 2012, and to be honest my experience has not been all that great. Long wait times, feeling like a number and not a patient, most times looking around the office I felt like I was in a legal drug house. And I dreaded on the last 11+ years the monthly visit to the pain management office. But that changed when I started seeing Dr. Sukumaran!!! The office is clean, the staff is phenomenal, and Dr. Sukumaran is so kind, empathetic, knowledgeable, and thorough. He takes time to really research what's going on with you, and is concerned about your quality of life, not just prescribing you a ton of medication. I am FLOORED how this doctor and staff have changed my complete experience with a Pain Specialist Doctor. His staff goes over and beyond to help you in any way possible! And Alicia is AMAZING!! Please Dr. Sukumaran give her a promotion and a good raise. She helped me every step of the way to find a pharmacy that would fill my prescription and for me I am forever grateful. I am truly thankful to have a Pain Specialist team who cares about me and treats me like a human being. Please consider making an appointment with this office. You thank me later.|I saw Dr. Sukumaran for Spinal Stenosis and we discussed the possibility  of my being a candidate for the MILD Procedure. He explained the procedure in detail answering all of our questions. I underwent the procedure in October 2024. Everyone at the Michigan Pain Clinic were very professional and pleasant. I spoke with Dr.. Sukumaran shortly before the procedure and it all went very smoothly. Recovery has progressed and I am feeling much better. I would recommend Dr. Sukumaran to anyone considering this option.|I just saw Dr. Sukumaran for severe back pain. Since I've seen him, I've needed medicine change due to severity of pain and called his office and left numerous messages for him and over four days no call back. He's not too concerned about his patients. I was advised from someone in his office to make an appointment to see him and express my concerns of his lack of response. So it's just to get the office visit payment? He hasn't returned a single message. So unprofessional.|I saw Nicole, Dr. Sukumaran's PA or NP. She's very professional! She asked me how I was doing since the MILD procedure. I'm doing very good.
She genuinely cared about my health.|Dr. Sukumaran is the best doctor I've ever met.  He sincerely cares for his patients and goes above and beyond to make sure that they get the best care possible.  He is a life saver and I cannot recommend him enough.|After 2 neck surgeries, I am disabled.  My life isn't what I hoped for or planned it to be, and it has been frightening to suffer every day and worry that medicine will not be available.   When I met Dr Sukumarah, I was downhearted because due to transportation issues, I had to find a nearer doctor.  What a blessing to be treated by this kind, patient, soft spoken and excellent doctor.  I thank God for him. He has helped me so much.|Dr Sukamaran has saved my life not one but twice. Highly recommend. Office staff not so good, tough to get through to a live person. The voice mail to text messages does not work well. Hours of operation not listed. Various opinions of closing time.
Office staff unaware of pricing of procedures.

I've been suffering from lower back pain for 15 years and had a spinal surgery, pain management is huge to my quality of life and Dr. Rahimi and his staff have made a drastic improvement on my quality of life! When I first came to him I was on disability for my pain and could not work. With his and his staff's care I am now working full time and managing my pain monthly at his office! His staff is amazing and so sweet|Still trying to bill me for missed appointments I told their secretary to cancel after she laughed at me for describing back domestic violence situation. I told her to cancel my apps, asked for a supervisor, she hung up on me and I have been unable to reach anyone by phone to discuss but they keep sending me bills for the missed appointments.|My pain was out of control when I heard about Dr Rahimi.  I had already tried two other pain clinics but I felt that they were pushing medications.

Dr. Rahimi has my pain much more controlled. When I started at his practice I was barely walking due to arthritis in my spine, 4 hip surgeries with a replacement and arthritis in most of my other joints.  Through a combination of gym and pool therapy, spine adjustments, spinal injections, medication and braces for my back and knees my life has improved drastically. Dr. Rahimi treats the whole person not just the areas that hurt.

Thank you Dr. Rahimi and staff I don't know what my quality of life would be like if I had not found out about you and your office.|This place is top notch. The physical therapists are tremendous.  I've been to other places that are just okay, this place is great. They do a wonderful job assessing the cause of pain, and apply their expertise to address it.

The office staff is really helpful and personable too.

Dr. Rahimi is is also very knowledgeable and knows how to treat pain.

My experience has been great!|Dr. Rahimi is a very kind doctor and listens to everything you tell him. He goes above and beyond to help patients with their pain.

I was bedridden from the neck and back pain for a while until he started treating me. I cannot thank him enough for everything he has done for me.|Dr Rahimi literally saved my life.  For 10 years and countless neurologist appointments, and hospital visits from falling over (all of which told me my tremor was from anxiety) he diagnosed me with Parkinson's after about 5 minutes.  This man is amazing, I will always be forever grateful to him for finally making me feel better. 10 stars!!!!|I have had nothing but positive experience with Dr. Rahimi and his staff. He's an extremely dedicate and caring physician and goes above and beyond to care for his patients. With Years of experience under his belt, a fully equipped facility and his dedicated staff I'm positive that I have received the best care possible.

Dr. Rahimi truly takes his time to assess the root of the problem. I strongly recommend him.|I've been seeing Dr. Rahimi for over two years now as a chronic pain patient. I had several bad experiences with another high profile pain doctor in Grand Rapids who's only an anesthesiologist by training, yet has a massive, assembly line style pain practice. That former pain doctor failed to offer me a full menu of much needed treatments in addition to injections, since all he wanted to do was inject me with steroids and be done with me. But I needed more help than that. Turns out, I actually needed things such as bracing for my spine, knees, wrist and neck, physical therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, non steroidal injections, etc. All those additional treatments were only offered to me for the first time by Dr. Rahimi. Because I have a connective tissue disorder, I actually needed them years ago, yet it wasn't until I left that other pain doctor, disgusted with his arrogance and lack of interest in my personal situation, and came to Dr. Rahimi, that I finally got them. I wasted years with the wrong doctor and deteriorated because of it.
I'm a former reporter and I find Dr. Rahimi to be highly intelligent, caring and thoughtful as a doctor seeking to control my pain. I wish I would have found him years ago, but am glad that I eventually left that other practice and found him. Physical therapy is fundamental in the control of the progression of my Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Dr. Rahimi understands my disorder fully, and offers a PT program in his practice. That fact, right there, tells me he cares about the long term interests of his patients.
There are many pain practices in the Grand Rapids' area, yet I know of no other that offers a full array of options to manage chronic pain. If you truly value your health and seek the best long term outcome with a pain practice that uses many different strategies in pain management, you'd do well to consider Dr. Rahimi.",2017-08-03|2024-02-24|2019-12-12|2022-03-07|2023-02-28|2021-12-22|2017-08-03|2017-08-03,5|1|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot","Do I need a referral?","Your Dr has to send you there!!!

Taken into exam room and waited a short time, doctor came in and reviewed my charts and explained my issues very well and we put a plan in place.
All in all, a very good experience for me.

The surgical center has been excellent the three times I have been there for blocks and an ablation.

In addition, Dr. Peter's PA is excellent in answering questions and providing information regarding my concerns.|Dr. Peter is great! I began seeing him about six months ago as recommended by my rheumatologist for many areas of back pain due to inflammatory arthritis and degenerative changes. He strongly advised me against getting cervical fusion surgery and I am SO THANKFUL for that. He promised we would figure out a solution and eventually we did with a cervical rhizotomy. It is a somewhat long process but that isn't his fault. His wait times are much more reasonable than any other doctor I see (and I see a lot of doctors). I'll see him in office and he suggests a steroid injection at his outpatient facility and they'll call me to schedule it within a week sometimes. Anyway, my neck pain was so severe for about two years and about a 9/10 pain level for past year almost daily. I was desperate and hopeless. Dr. Peter made me a person again! My neck pain is now just a 3/10 (which is like a zero to me). He didn't give up like all my other doctors. The last time I saw him I wanted to give him a huge hug so bad but he doesn't seem like the hugging type, haha. Highly recommend this intelligent, super skilled doctor. He will find the right spot! His staff is all super nice and friendly as well. I almost enjoy going to the pain clinic. I definitely believe listening to this man's opinions is worthwhile and that he is trustworthy. This is not the case with every doctor, unfortunately.|Dr. Peter was very nice and thorough when I visited him this past Monday. He listened and answered my questions and I was very pleased with his treatment plan. Thank you for an awesome experience! Kia was very good as well! Kudos to the staff for their timeliness and dedication to treating their patients with respect and dignity. I recommend Dr. Peter highly.|Dr. Peter is very knowledgeable, caring and thorough.  I had some problems with the scheduling though. He put notes in the paperwork that I could only come in on a specific week and my paperwork said I was diabetic so I was supposed to have an early appointment but the scheduling staff only offered me to come in on a week I couldn't due to my husbands surgery or to take a late appointment.   That was the second time.  The first time they had to rearrange the sched to get me in early.  I don't know why they don't presort by diabetic and not for scheduling and/ or special notes.  Poor planning and scheduling. The shots haven't worked for me but the did for my husband but it was a different Dr.|Great DR, really cares about helping your pain go away, also I've had 2 epidurals and don't have to wait more than a few minutes before I you get called back the procedure is relatively quick and pretty painless, you just feel a lot of pressure where they did the procedure. Dr Peter has been a great doctor for me and he is a great pain Dr to for anyone unhappy with where that are going.|I first saw Dr Jason Peter for steroid injections in my back related to a wotkplace injury in 2010 at another practice and was beyond happy to become his patient again after 14 years! Dr Peter has the magical touch! I look forward to continuing our patient, doctor relationship for as long as he can help me! He also has a great sense of humor!|I love Dr. Peter and his team! They work well together & value their patients in every way. I've been a patient for about 4 years & my pain management has been a great experience.|Dr. Peter and his staff are phenomenal. They listen to you when you're speaking & then determine a plan of action that works best for you! They speak with you not at you! They care about your well being & want you to be comfortable.

I was being treated in the Marshall Mi office. I told the Dr and staff we winter in Florida. I called today to have my records sent to Florida. They said they could not do that unless I came in or went thru their 3rd party in Nashville Tn and gave me a link that difficult to use. I called back the Marshall and the staff seemed annoyed but said I had to go thru the 3rd party in Nashville pay them $25. Without a computer my phone wasn't going to co-operate with all the paperwork needed to be filled out and put my credit card number online. The pain clinic was rude and very annoyed that I called back again and could have cared less how much pain I was in. They were nasty. Never going back there. They knew I was going to Florida for the winter and had they taken the time to have me sign a release before i left instead of going thru this agony there would not have been this issue. This review is not against the Doctor but the staff they could have tried to help me as i have no computer here. I should have payed attentions to the reviews. This review is from Chyrell Nawatny|I was a patient of Dr Bez who is no longer with the practice. I was required to see a different (fill in) Dr who did absolutely nothing for my pain and sent me on my way. I put a call into the office and next day they called back with an appointment to get me back in, much sooner than I had expected. Dr Wild then saw me, and took a very hands on approach. He put in place both a temporary and long term plan for relief and I am so grateful. I felt heard by the practice, I felt safe and in good hands, and finally I am going to be pain free again. I can't thank them enough. I've been so miserable costing me my quality of life. Thank you all at SMPC!!|I am so appreciative of Dr. Wild / Stephanie Willett and the entire Staff for their genuine patient ""care"". It is so hard to find a place were you aren't just a number. Thank You ALL over and over!!!|First visit the doctor insisted on doing the injections in the least painful part of my entire back. As expected I got zero relief. 2 weeks later I go in for the follow-up appointment. Their records showed that I had stated I had gotten 50% pain relief from the first injections WTH!!! After sitting for an hour and 15 minutes waiting to see the doctor, both legs went completely numb and I could barely hold my head up. I just had to get the hell out of there|I don't know what happened to Dr's caring for patients instead of a paycheck but after over 13 yrs, I have to leave smpc & Dr wild. All because someone typed a date wrong for insurance. You have no customer appreciation, to prevent a patient from being seen knowing it's an insurance glitch is unjust & not fair to the patient. Especially after countless of hours & stress to make sure it's fixed, you have a date from Medicare but the process will take the time n you still refuse to get an appointment on the books. You are unethical/cruel Because you don't care that you're losing a patient. Exact words were ""that's fine"" when I said I'd have to find another doctor. Could say so much more but done. Dr wild and the nurses are wonderful but if you don't want to be cut off without notice, don't go here, because they don't care to do anything but blame each other for not seeing you n there is no leeway or understanding for billing glitches, the patient is punished|This is a specialty pain clinic so you may have a wait but the staff and Dr's are excellent at their job and very considerate of you concerning your pain. They are there for you and the insurance companies are the ones that make everything difficult not the pain clinic. I would recommend this clinic, they keep it clean and they try to make you comfortable.|Arrived at 9:30, 30 minutes early as instructed.  Was handed a packet stating this clinic may be late for my appointment but I can't be late.  I waited until 10:30 before asking what was going on and was told, you will be next but it could still be awhile.  This is very inconsiderate of my time.  Staff are rude and nasty when asked why it was taking so long.  The wait is outrageous.  If your not in pain when you arrive, you will be when you leave from waiting for over an hour for a simple consultation.  A complaint will be filed with the Medical Association.  THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THE WAIT TIME.|Wish I could give 10 stars to Dr. Wild and his staff. Dr. Wild is kind, patient and a wonderful doctor. I go in for shots to manage my chronic pain, everyone here is so kind.

He was right to.I could not be happier, Dr. Rojas is patient, he does not rush.He is aware of and remembers exactly why you are there without relying on your file.

He took ample time to ask questions and really listened  to my concerns, something most physicians do not seem to do anymore.

I wasted 1 year of my life in severe back pain and I was begging for help. did not want pain pills, I only wanted pain relief. Ii finally ordered my own MRI and pointed exactly where the pain was. I
was told I had anxiety. Wow I am soooo glad I found a REAL doctor that fixed my back, I am pain free and had to fight for myself to find a competent doctor with the help of my excellent PCP. 2 docs at this clinic failed me Dr. Patel and Dr Haladjian , thank God but their  partner doc listened to me and fixed my back. . Don't waste your time or insurance on this one! These 2 docs will play games with you, don't trust them ! They are good buddies and the surgeon there will go with anything the anesthesiologist says, even though he's not a real doc.Thank you God for the real surgeon s that will stand up for their patients and not their partners. All I have to say is SHAME on you 2 for refusing to help me!|Great Dr. has taken care of my husband since his accident. He is so personable and really cares|**SECOND REVIEW**
I already left a review for Dr. Haladjian but I had another excellent experience that I needed to share. I had severe pain in my back and called Dr. Haladjian. He responded very quickly and accommodated me in a short time to perform a procedure to eliminate my back pain. I feel like a new human! I highly recommend him.

(Last year)
I saw Dr. Halajdian at his office for a separate low back pain problem and was treated well from the beginning, which was one of the reasons I returned. I received a painless treatment for my condition. Since that treatment, I've been pain-free in my lower back. His office staff followed up with me the next day to make sure I was OK. I had no issues with Dr. Haladjian and his staff. My experience was wonderful and I plan to return for any pain management needs. I highly recommend him to anyone who needs pain management care.|Best pain management doctor I've had. Have seen him now for 10 years and have grown to trust him and always feel that he has my best interest at heart. He is open, honest and knowledgeable. (This is saying a lot I feel coming from a retired nurse!) All of the staff at the Brownstown location have been wonderful as well. Very kind and efficient. Really just an excellent practice.|I have been a patient for over 6 years. Dr. Haladjian has made such a positive impact on my life. I am chronically ill with chronic pain. I was barley walking 3 Years ago and now walk most times without assistance. I have had many procedures done in office with exceptional care. His staff is kind an efficient.  They are the best in their field I have seen a few pain specialist over the years Dr. Haladjian and his staff are by far the best.  I would recommend him highly and proudly. I am extremely grateful for his care.|My back pain has been so bad to where I couldn't even stand at work without wanting to cry. I have been getting injections in my back for two years now and I feel like they are little miracles. I realize that every person is different but I can honestly say I trust Dr. Haladjian's medical opinion and the fact that he has so much experience is very comforting as well.  Needless to say he has helped me a great deal. :)|I am a patient at his Brownstown office, I have been going to this office for a couple years and the office staff is very professional, nice and  helpful. I can not say enough good things about Dr. Haladjian. He has helped me with my back pain and chronic pain, when no one else could. He takes time with the patients, always has a smile, addresses your issues and is very concerned and considerate of his patients. I have and will recommend Dr. Haladjian to anyone that needs a good Dr. that cares about his patients. My quality of life has greatly improved since I have been going to him. Many thanks to Dr. Haladjian and his staff for all they have done and still do for me.
Pam Fineberg|Every pain doctor I have seen at Detroit Henry Ford Main Pain Management treated me with suspension and disrespect. Like I was street addict and the wait time was murder on my back, and I hardly ever seen a real doctor. Then I went to DR. Haladjian, whom treats me as a patient in pain and in need of help, not just pain medicine, he take his time when you need him to to explain things and listen you and your needs. His staff and him will work to help you find that medium you need with/or without your medicine. He is a very hard working, diligent, and intelligent doctor who ever since I have been going to has help me with my pain and my addiction to find my 100% right mixture of treatment and medicine to live my life better and pain free,  without the 2 to 3 hour office visit.. To sum it up, He a great doctor and I would recommend him to anyone who is tired of being treated like an addict and want to been treated like a patient.",2024-01-02|2024-12-14|2019-12-14|2022-04-28|2017-06-08|2014-01-31|2014-11-11|2014-02-09,1|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|friendly_staff|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|thorough_care|good_doctors|convenient_clinic_location|medication_management|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|on_site_pharmacy|advanced_treatment_options|multilingual_staff_available,,,,,,,,,,ChIJq4XM_os1O4gRk2CXVYTcWMk,26

When I got to where they do the injection. The people were great.From the Lady who checked me in until I walked out the door.

His staff at Pain Clinic of Michigan in Troy are very pleasant. I have only good things to say.

The front desk is helpful and it is best to complete all paperwork on line, so you don't have to worry about anything else when you arrive.

Dr. Peter started my evaluation on my neck by reviewing my X-rays and MRI on my first visit.  Then he explained what was going on with my neck and discussed what options I have.  I decided to get the 2 blocks and an ablation on the neck.

Had both blocks and ablation completed at the Oakland Surgi-Center.  Neck is definitely better than it was before I had these procedures completed.

All of my experiences to date have been outstanding. Dr. Jason Peter and his PA-C Ben Carolan. and the entire staff have been pleasant to work with in Troy.

I would definitely recommend Dr. Jason Peter and the Oakland Surgi-Center staff.|Please believe these reviews and run while you still can.  I had been seeing him for sometime.  Dr. Peters pulled my RX history and commenced to question me about why doctors had me on certain medications.  My medicines had been like this for a long time.  Instead of contacting those doctors and getting clarification He chose to cold turkey stop my visits and stop writing my script for pain meds and told me to go someplace else.  This is something that is life threatening.  A pain mgmt patient is NOT advised to cold turkey a pain med yet tapper it off.  It took me weeks to get into a new doctors visit to continue my care which could have caused me major complications beyond the withdrawals that it sent me into. Thankfully  I called my primary care and they wrote my script to hold me over until til I could get in with a new doctor and stop the withdrawals.  You can kill a person my discontinuing their medication like that.  And it goes against the rules of any pain mgmt office which makes you sign a contract.  Which in that contract it states that should a problem arise a script will be written until you can get into see someone else because stopping cold turkey is dangerous.  He went against all of that and didn't care and decided to argue with me tooth and nail..........even using profanity!  At that point I left to keep myself from doing something that would not have turned out nice!  I now see a wonderful pain mgmt doctor who is very caring and handles things properly and professionally.  And all of my circumstances are the same!  You appreciate a good doctor coming from a bad one!|Dr peters hubris is only surpassed by his ignorance of chronic pain patients. He called me a liar when 11 different pharmacies informed me that the er meds prescribed were unavailable for months, go if you want to but be prepared to be talked down to|I have been seeing Dr Peters for several years . My mom actually was seeing him before me , he took EXCELLENT care of my mom was not only a very good Dr. but cared about her well being . I switched from the Dr who I was seeing ( he was a pill pusher and wanted me to take very strong narcotics!!!). When I seen how WONDERFUL Dr. Peter's was with my mom i decided to switch to him. Again I've been seeing him for many years .He has performed many procedures on me when only needed . I Love him ! I highly recommend him .  The office is clean and the staff is awesome!  5 stars plus !|Anyone thinking about going to this office should think twice. Dr. Peter was horribly rude and argumentative. Asked who referred my son to him and when we told him the doctor he said he doesn't know him and doesn't know how they get his name? Does it matter? When I told him that one of my son's doctors no longer sees him because he doesn't have good insurance anymore I was told that no doctor should take his insurance because it's garbage. That they don't get any money from them. Really?  My son didn't ask to be sick and unfortunately is now on disability. I guess anyone on Medicare doesn't deserve good treatment.|Reception was very kind. I had all of the information recommended in the information packet provided prior to the appointment and checking in was smooth and timely.
Dr. Peter was thorough with his exam and his reviews of the images I presented related to my several back surgeries. He is professional, efficient, kind and is clearly in the profession to help. I highly recommend his services for anyone dealing with chronic pain. I sought him out to help me manage my pain and therefore improve function and recommend further testing and services as needed. After my first appointment I am confident he will provide and recommend what is necessary, no more and no less.|Besides a crazy amount of paperwork, I had a great visit. Dealing with DDD and swelling in the back causing pain, he spent a while going over my MRI images with me and walking me through my options with pro/cons. He spent a lot of time making sure I understood my younger age can play into these options as I still have a ways to live. He was professional, kind, and let me speak freely. I had a migraine when I saw him, so I probably was not the most friendliest when I came in, but he still treated with me respect. While I didn't get injections as my spinal doctor encouraged, I do believe the alternative method Dr. Peters directed me to will be better long-term. Thank you!|I had previously visited another pain management doctor for chronic neck issues I have been having however, I was dissatisfied with the care that I received and Dr. Peter was recommended by a trusted colleague.

She has made it so I can be active again.  She is kind and caring and listens to her patients.|My Dr. is Jill Ross and she is just the sweetest ever! She's truly so kind and knowledgeable.  She's the first doctor to know about my rare diagnosis and the best way to treat it. She's patient and works with you. I won't go anywhere else. Unless she moves facilities in which I will follow her there. The office staff is very kind and works with your schedule. The facility is very clean and just a great place all around. I was scared when my old doctor retired and I had to come here but now it think it was a blessing in disguise.|Use to be Exceptional! Use to be great! Now, it's barely tolerable.  They deserve negative stars, but Google doesn't allow that.

Dr. only showed up part-time. And it may not be the same Dr you saw late time. Why? Because s/he left the office or company. Many times when you are informed that the Dr. will be with you. It's the nurse practitioner (NP), not a Dr. Also, during my appointments, NP has to repeatedly leave the appointment room to grab paperwork to explain issues and answer questions. Many times, it doesn't answer the question that I asked. She doesn't answer all the questions posed to her, nor does she provide the requested material/contract I signed.

She doesn't have any idea of what we were meeting for at my most recent appointments; despite having requested an MRI repeatedly, having to contact or come back to this office repeatedly for authorizations or complaints aboutthe missing document, and constantly remind her and the rest of the people in this office I'm still waiting on the authorizations MRIs her office requested.

This is in addition to the constant disregard of pain and seriousness of my pain. Only to inform me (insult me) by saying several times that my pain is just ""normal wear and tear."". My husband stated that if my pain was normal, then everyone would be here with this issue, including him. (He's several years older than me without any back problems.)

The disregarding of me and my husband's comments, concerns, and requests; the dismissive way they handle our complaints regarding my pain; lack of empathy; and their bedside manner has made me look for another pain management team. Especially since this team lacks everything a good pain management team needs, should have, and should be required.|Do not let your loved ones go here. This place is nothing more than a prescription mill. They just blindly prescribe Percocet. They do not manage or care about side effects. They do not look to see possible and potentially dangerous drug interactions. They do not monitor abuse or misuse stemming from chemical dependency.  They do not check for hepatotoxicity, which is actually mind blowing seeing as how most modern pain killers are cut with Tylenol.  It's my opinion that there is some type of financially beneficial, kickback, agreement between the prescribers here and Endo Pharmaceuticals and the other Oxycodone manufacturers.

Do not let your loved ones go here, especially elderly loved ones.|This place is disgusting so is the nurse Jill Ross who thinks shes a doctor. I went here after being in a flip over car accident. I suffered two broken legs and three broken ribs. I have a total of seven fractures. Anyways, when i went to my appointment which was at nine am and the weather consisted of freezing rain and snow. I made my way there with my driver and i arrived on time. My driver came in the room with me. Then in comes this obnoxious lady Jill Ross. She proceeds to tell me shes not going to give me anything for pain because last time i was there i didnt finish PT i told her i was suffering at the time with psoriasis and i had a very bad break out. I said my husband went to the hospital last night after work to the hospital to get my ct scans and radiographs. She said im not going to look at them Im not even going to give u anything so just leave. I said no im not leaving i want to see a doctor but this nasty lady replied im the doctor here today. I said you are no doctor your a nurse practitioner. It was a horrible experience this lady does not belong helping a rat. She was so nasty, obnoxious and rude. Im currently filing a complaint with the state of michigan. Beware of this uncaring creepy place and Jill Ross.|This place is the absolute best for my pain management.

The office staff used to be amazing and superb, however, there are a few newer and younger girls that are absolutely terrible. They're rude, they lie, they raise voices, and are genuinely just vindictive. Being a healthcare professional, whether you are a private practice or not, if you accept state insurance, you abide by state insurance policies. There was an appointment that was cancelled 24 hours in advance due to a sickness (called on a Sunday, appt was Tuesday) and they still charged $25, said that if next appointment wasn't attended, then it would be an extra $25. Go in the next day and they try to turn her away due to using debit card instead of cash, which they never specified. I wouldn't recommended them to anybody, being in the healthcare field, the girls are incompetent and genuinely make themselves look extremely bad. They think they're ""baddies""  however, they definitely need a humbling. I would recommend Kotob go over professional development with them.|I have been seeing Doc for 5 yrs.i am full of arthritis and hurt every day he has made my daily life very manageable. Himself and his staff are very kind to me anytime I visit I have never had a bad experience at this office  Thanks Doc Toni and the rest of the staff|My spine has arthritis from top to bottom. I have had two surgeries, one in the lower back, and one in the cervical area. Dr. Kotob saw a problem in my spine with pressure on my spinal column. Surgery followed. Now two years later, periodically receiving injections into my lower back had helped me live a little more of a normal life. I thank the doctor, and his staff for their support and care.|I've been going here since may of 2020 after being referred by my primary doctor. It has been a great experience. The staff has always been very friendly. The doctor has been outstanding. I recommend this office to anyone dealing with severe pain.|I went here for a little while and he got upset because my other doctor had me on a benzo and he didn't agree with it because I dropped dirty for it he stopped seeing me saying I was using drugs and couldn't be on that benzo with the pain meds I was on. I need the anxiety meds as no other ones have worked for my severe panic attacks and anxiety and as long as I'm ok with mixing the meds and my other doctor is there shouldn't be a problem. Now I'm in pain for years without any meds because of this doctor|After only a few visits with Dr. Kotob, he wanted to schedule me to have injections the following week. When I informed him that I would have to wait a few weeks due to surgery in was having on my hand he began to ask who would and why I was having surgery. When he found out that Dr. xxxxxxx from Insight was doing the surgery he became enraged. He was yelling at me accusing my of going behind his back to another pain management facility, told me I was double dipping, and even went as far as to say wait and see what will happen. Later I found out that meant he would not be calling in my prescription for neuropathy. Yes insight does have a pain management facility, but there was never any plans for me to use the services. Insight offers several different services. He was very unprofessional and I would not recommend him to anyone nor will I ever step foot in his office again.|I had been looking forward to becoming a new patient. That is until I met him at my appointment. He has a heavy accent and I could not understand him. He got angry for having to repeat himself. Not my fault. He calls you a liar if you tell him things that your primary care Dr has told you. If you are a sensitive person, don't go cuz his harshness will make you feel uncomfortable. I flat out told him that I am staying with my current pain doc. Dr Kotob made me appreciate my pain doc that I thought was arrogant. You don't know arrogant til you meet this guy. Sorry Dr Kotob, I don't know if you are a knowledgeable Dr because I couldn't get past your bedside manner. Maybe you didn't mean to be a jerk but you certainly came across that way.|I love Dr. Kotob I have been going to him for almost a year.  I get injections in my back, and have less chronic pain.  My injections last about 2 and 1/2 months.  He understands it hurts, he told me he gets them too.

On that note I absolutely must say that they take care of your actual needs. Brian Prize is just that, a prize if you're so lucky to have him. The receptionist is an absolute angel, the nurses are fricken amazing & a few of them are SUPER cute. I couldn't have asked to be put in better hands. Thank you BCFPM, because of you I can walk without crying like a little girl (I'm a 48yo man)|They have changed hands. Now run by NORTHSTAR ANESTHESIA, based in TX. The pieces are now falling into place. Loss of the better PA's (Anita Parker PA)(Dr. Cain Dimon) and other staff. Pray that you don't get assigned to Brian ""Booby"" Prize. This greenhorn had 8 months exp. when assigned to me, no knowledge of pain mgt. or bedside manner.
He took over the morphine weaning process started months earlier by PA Anita Parker. Then he sent me 8/05/2020 for morphine / bupivecaine Intrathecal Pump removal at WBH Royal Oak and I came home with meningitis....INFECTED with PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA by ""surgeon"" Dr. Larry Manders. He was more concerned about taking photos of my teeth before I came out of anesthesia than my headache, nausea and neck pain.
Four days after outpatient surgery I returned to ER after feeling as if I had been hit in the back of my head with a baseball bat. Pain shot across my head ear-to-ear, and down my neck & spine past my shoulder blades. Hurt so badly I did not lock my front door or shut my computer down (which was hacked for $1700 sent to Tran Van Minh in Hue City, Vietnam).
I arrived at 10PM Sunday, 8/9/2020. Five hours later I was dumped into a bed at 3:00AM. NO ONE TOLD ME during my 9-day ER hospitalization I had meningitis....INFECTED with PSUEDOMONOS AERUGINOSA. My ins. company says I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. I did not learn of the infection for 13 months when infectious doc posted it to my Beaumont Chart. I went untreated for 4 days before I put my foot down and complained to PA Anita Parker that each morning I get visited by 5 docs doing their rounds, but NO ONE WAS TAKING ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY CARE. She turned me on my side and commented she could see my spinal fluid leaking around the staples in my lumbar incision.
Oct.13, 2020, came Dr. Shivani Singh, MD who took a culture of my leaking spinal fluid. Within hours I was having a PICC Line installed so they could pump me full of Vancomycin, an anti-biotic so toxic it would eat the tubes of a normal IV.
August 2021 I was given a different type of drug test by PA Jolene Koganti. She remembered I had drank three bottles of water and previously spent 4 hours trying to give a urine sample in a bathroom with motion detecting lights. There I was, penis in hand with my plastic cup, IN THE DARK with ASSOCIATES CONSTANTLY POUNDING ON THE DOOR; ""ARE YOU OK IN THERE?"".
The new test was a wad of felt stuck under my tongue.  The associate said let me see it. It turned blue-turquoise but she said put it back in.
When she took it out again it was in 2 pieces which she put into a plastic tube.
Oct.12, 2021 I returned to get the hydromorphone refilled which I had recently been changed to. I had been having digestive trouble for 36 hours. Did not eat or drink from Sunday afternoon until after my Tues. appointment. I was weak, dehydrated, and cranky because the toilet trips did not end until 4:00AM the same day as my 12:30PM appointment. Looking back, I should have cancelled. I did not urinate until 12:30AM, Oct.13,2021.
In less than 5 minutes Mr. ""BOOBY"" Prize said I am discharging you because you failed your last drug test. WHAT? No failures in the previous 8 years as a patient. Despite filling out a request for my medical records I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF A FAILED DRUG TEST. That was a bogus test and he knows it.
He knew nothing of the meningitis or PSUEDOMONAS AERUGINOSA compliments of his sending me to WBH Royal Oak.
As soon as he said DISCHARGE I told him to eat sh*t. I immediately knew I would be facing terrible withdrawal from the opioids I had been prescribed for over 20 years. Withdrawal lasted over three horrendous weeks. Allegedly, I SLAMMED THE EXAM DOOR OPEN (is that possible?) and he was more than excited to tag me HOSTILE and forever ban me from treatment. He has not seen hostile yet.
Don't get the Medtronics Pump if you want to travel for more than 60 days. Also, NO DOCS in USA will refill it. You will be tethered to them as long as you have the pump. Medicare does not cover overseas treatment.|I have regular pain management appointments here and I cannot say enough good things about the entire staff. From my pain management physician to the entire nursing staff, these are health care workers who care about their patients. I've been coming here for over a year now and I've not had one negative experience. Highly recommend!|I have been trying to get a new patient appointment for one month. I have called this office daily at different times; no one ever answers the phone. You will wait on a poor audio quality hold line recording and then be transferred to a voicemail after waiting. I received call back messages while at work and unable to answer, with no information on how to get an appointment. After getting through to a real person for the first time I was abruptly transferred to the medication refill line in error. I left a detailed pleading message asking for someone to please help me get an appointment. I received a call back within the hour to inform me that my referral from one month ago had never been received. I was told ""I doubt anything I say will make you happy "" I let her know that my happiness is not a concern; I just want an appointment.  Although the caller offered to contact my family doctor for the referral, the fact remains that have yet to be offered a new patient appointment, even though she was clearly and admittedly viewing my Beaumont chart and notes from a previous pain doctor. I have never experienced this kind of difficulty in making a doctors appointment in my entire life. It's still unknown whether or not I will ever be offered to make a new patient appointment. The one star rating will remain until I experience improved customer service. I'm a patient, a human being trying to get help from a doctor,  not a telephone solicitor. It seems like they are assuming that most callers will be drug seeking addicts and give up after never being able to talk to anyone. This situation is a real shame and needs to be addressed by someone who is responsible and concerned with the way patients are treated.|This practice doesn't care about what's going on with you. They're very cold at this practice. Johneen is the rudest person! She is racist and very judgemental. If I could rate them a zero I would! The doctor I only saw a few times getting my shots, they didn't help. All they do is keep making you appointments w the nurse, switching your meds. I don't take anything for pain.  I don't take any opioids, they don't work anyways. They have not suggested anything else to manage my pain! Beaumont is the worst hospital! I'm in the middle of changing hospitals and I'm so glad I did!|My primary Physician has referred me to here for bone and joint pain. I have joint and disc disease and many fractures due to osteoporosis. Their office left me a voicemail sayin she got my referral but in reviewing my chart she saw I also have fibromyalgia and that they do not accept patients that have fibro. Over 5 million people suffer from fibro pain in the US and one of our biggest hospital pain management centers won't treat them. That's horrible.|They can't even tell if a person is  faking pain that is  very sad I tried for many years to be referred to someone who can help me. I found a real doctor who treats me for a very painful nerve disease. I can only hope  that Rachel has become humble and no longer treats people like dirt because she doesn't understand how the human body body works.  Yes Rechal  my muscles weren't working  and You have
seen  my spine.

As a first-time patient in pain management, my experience at MIPM has been beyond exceptional. **Tobias G.** stands out for his ability to listen, understand, and go above and beyond in providing care. I highly recommend him.

**Beth R.** made my first experience with physical therapy amazing. Her knowledge, support, and personal touch made me feel like family. If I ever need PT again, I'd go out of my way to see her.

However, I'd recommend keeping your distance from **Dr. Sanjeev A. Just because a person has DR. Before their name does not make them superior to others. 

Overall, Tobias and Beth are two of the best healthcare professionals I've encountered. Their care and compassion make all the difference. Can't forget the amazing staff at the reception. It feels as if their smile alone was made for healing, you feel better as soon as you walk in. A simple smile goes long ways. Thank you all, I hope this helps someone out there.

~Abdul (Babhi) Mohamed|I was sceptical at first. After my first visit I knew I made the right choice. I not only see pain management but also do physical therapy. I made the right decision coming here. Both of the pain specialists are great and listen to every concern. The physical therapist is great. She has great concern for all of your concerns. The front office staff is always so warm and inviting. You always feel in good hands every time you are here. My whole family has been coming here since an automobile accident. Come here and get the proper care you need.|Great staff and doctors. They help me recover from all my pain. Im very please with their professional service.|Really awesome place they actually take there time out to listen to you and help you get better as I'm trying to heal from an accident I just had in the recent year I'm already getting better I would high recommend Minnesota institute for pain management|I had an awful experience here. I switched to this clinic after a long move and had hope due to good reviews, but my experience was less than pleasant. To start, they wouldn't do treatments till they had medical records sent. I kept calling my prior clinic who insisted they had sent them and it said delivered on their end multiple times. They sent my records a total of 3 times and I even showed my dr the records from my phone.
They would take weeks to follow up with appointments. i needed an MRI order before I could be scheduled for a nerve block to which they told me I would be in within 2 weeks. This didn't happen- I called multiple times inquiring when they'd order an MRI and I was always told ""I'm not sure but I'll get back to you."" I'd never hear back. Finally a month and half later I got an MRI order.
Then my Dr left which isn't their fault BUT they said by September they'd know more and they'd call. I never received a phone call and now it's January. Even if they had no new provider who could take my insurance it would've been nice to know. Although who knows if that's even the case.
How frustrating for someone who lives in pain. I was at the point of depression for how bad my pain got. Luckily I found somewhere else where they've been appropriately treating me and following up when they say they will.|struggling with chronic back and neck injuries and pain isn't easy but, Dr. Orora has been diligently helping me get through it all. Not only through different treatments but also by educating me about the anatomy of the spine in which can trigger certain symptoms as they arise due to me being in two car accidents.Dr. Orora is always actively listening to my concerns about any issues that I may be experiencing. Even the front desk receptionist Maria is always extremely helpful and kind as well as the other receptionists during check-ins and out.|After dealing with an issue that has cause me Chronic Pain since 2011 , in 2021 I finally found someone who literally took time to help me at this clinic! The doctor was wonderful, he started making since of why I'm having these problems I'm having and what has been causing the chronic pain ETC... he did, MRI, X-rays, ET. no other doctor besides one, back in 2011 ((RIP to him)) when I first found out what was causing the pain. So back to 2021 I searched, researched, googled hours ETC and decided to go with this clinic, I was so happy! After going for about 4-5months he finally got me on a pain regimen and I was starting to feel normal like myself ((since 2011)) I was so grateful! In 2022 my Doctor left this clinic I was very, very disappointed but another doctor took over wonderful!!! At first I was very skeptical because I've had such horrible luck dealing with doctors who are quacks! But this doctor was even better and he cared and I never had a doctor like him in my entire life care like he did! So here comes 2023 August to be exact! I go for my follow up and he tells me he's also now leaving! Ugh! When I say I wanted to cry I wanted to cry! This man is amazing!! So come September I get a call to come into the clinic and have an appointment with Doctor Arua, I come to my appointment never seen or met his man in my life but apparently the clinic is his , anywho! The energy was completely off from the other staff I have been dealing with! Mind you the staff has been amazing the scheduling desk ETC.... Everyone is very, very nice and friendly and I'm assuming they care, I never felt any different or felt uncomfortable! Anywho back to September 2023 So I go into meet Doctor Aura and I'm not really feeling the vibe or energy! But oh well I let it slide. I'm just here for basically a 30min - hr visit. He tells me he doesn't have a doctor yet and he doesn't accept the insurance I have. So he said I can refer you to a different clinic or You can do cash. I said hmmm.... Okay, well I really didn't wanna pay out of pocket ((so I said well if you know a good doctor you can refer me somewhere)) which he did. They called me about 5days later, and I set an appointment up. The appointment was set up after the dates my prescription were due! So now I'm really stressed out at this point. Because am I addict to a 3.5 MG and a 5MG Percocet that is mostly Tylenol it's kind of impossible for me to be addicted to any of that! I take 1 every 6hours I mean in all reality you people aren't even writing enough for someone to be addicted to it! Anywho, so I said well let me just called the clinic and ask could he refill them since the date is out, so I talked to a really sweet girl who understood where I was coming from and she said I'm gonna talk to the doctor so I said thank, she called me back 2hrs later and said the doctor said he could this one time ((she told me a lot of patients were calling who got booted out because a certain type of insurance! So I said thank you so much! I really, really appreciate it tell the doctor I'm very grateful. 3 days before my appointment I got sicker than a dog! I was down 2 weeks ((no way I would ever in my life go and contaminate and spread germs to individuals I feel that is one of the most selfish things you can do in life is to know you're sick and go around people and get them sick)) plus my mother is an RN! She would whoop my tail! J/k she is a RN though, been one 45 years, she has ran a entire business ((group homes)) but for the last 13yrs she has been working from home tending to my father who is considered a quadriplegic due to a quack overdosing him with blood pressure medicine and he had a reaction he was out of town in a different state when he took it and he was left by himself on the floor for 3days! When he was found his temperature was a 21 he was slowly dying, anywho. So I do go and help my mother with my dad 7days a week in the evenings after I work a full time job Mon-Fri my days are usually 14-16hrs. My mother is 63 and my father is 78 and it's a part 2 to this, give me a min.|TERRIBLE FOLLOW THROUGH! This place is awful. My doctor wanted me to have an injection done 5 MONTHS AGO.  It has never taken more than a week to get a prior authorization approved for the same type of injection. I have called and spoken to different people there 10 separate times over the course of 5 months and they say they will look into it and call me back and no one ever does. They give me no information as to what the problem is. Also the doctors keep leaving so I have been switched to 3 different doctors now. If you want your time wasted, and want to get moved from doctor to doctor every couple months then this is the place for you.

Other pain clinics prescribe expecting people to have ""other* things in their system with the understanding & agreement that will stop immediately, and levels will go down, BUT if you have anything vin your system they refuse pain meds, most of us would drink cat pee if it took away the pain, and it's a process to get Diagnosed & then referred to a clinic, this needs to change. This is why you have so many fentanyl deaths, we can't get fair pain management
Thank you
PS: I wasn't implying I had anything in my system, just a point I was making, I failed a ua at a different clinic, something I didn't use, but have figured out how it was introduced to my system, twin city pain wasted my time & my gas & I'm sure billed my insurance for me to come to a 2nd appointment  to tell me they won't help me because of a ua NOT done at their clinic, or while I was their patient ! I passed their UA, that could have been a phone call, meanwhile I'm suffering!! Good job DR's
The medical system and providers are badly broken. I was honest from the moment I made my appointment. I didn't use anything, I did drink something that has something in it I was not aware of this till today 02/18/2025!!!!
It was done on purpose to sabotage a custody battle
May you never be made to suffer like you are helping to make me & others suffer with your f#cked up policy|Dr. Crewdson is an excellent listener and actually read all the background information that I brought in.

I have multiple problems from previous surgeries and I'm looking at more Surgeries ahead for me. Bethanie takes all that into consideration with her decision on how she treats me.

They are prepared when you arrive and are very thorough to make sure the correct procedure is being done in the correct place.  Dr. Haas has been my doctor for several procedures and she is always pleasant and explains what she is doing and what to expect.  She doesn't just follow protocol and go step by step, she also treats the patient to make sure you are doing ok and that you are comfortable.  They have great staff and are always willing to explain or help in any way possible.  They do very good work and I would strongly recommend them to anyone seeking pain management.|After nearly losing my right hand due to compartment syndrome from a car accident, chronic pain completely derailed my aspirations for life.  Over the 16 years that I've been a patient with Twin Cities Pain Clinic, my everyday life has slowly broadened.  They have treated me like a unique individual with different sensitivities and tolerances.  Dr. Haas has been amazingly skillful and wise.  With new technology and treatment options, although I still have some days with pain, they are magnitudes of order more manageable and I enjoy many pain-free days.  It's like being freed from heavy shackles.|I was in so much pain it felt like labor contractions, and I had challenges walking. My doctor had no openings, so I had to see one in Eden Prairie. As long as I've been going to TCPC, I've never asked for pain medication. I was super disappointed that I wasn't offered at least a one/two-day supply of something other than steroids, and call your primary in two weeks if you don't feel better. I even asked for a prescription for pain patches, she said they are over the counter now. Any pain doctor knows over 4% lidocaine has to be prescribed. When meeting a doctor for the first time, I always advocate for myself, especially when they ask me, ""Do you have any questions?"" I always ask, ""Do you believe AAs have a higher threshold than my white counterparts?"" I didn't this time. I think I was in so much, and I trusted that I would be well taken care of because of my long relationship with this organization instead of sitting in an ER for hours, which I am probably going to have to do because I am still in excruciating pain, with no relief in my near future!|In general I have had very good experiences at the Pain Clinic.

I have an appointment once a month and every doctor has been personable which helps me feel comfortable. I now have a spinal cord stimulator which is an excellent invention. I had no idea I could be brave enough to get one. The TCPC picked up where the Mayo Clinic left off as Mayo does not do follow on as they mainly diagnose and operate - they did my spinal fusion.

While I was at the clinic I received a call about a  death in my family. She hugged me and consoled me with such kind words .  She showed genuine concern about me and my family. She stayed with me until we both felt I could handle the drive home.  At my next visit, 4 months later, she remembered  me and inquired how my family was doing.|I have been sick for 18yrs and Tobbie is one of the kindest Drs I've ever had! My situation is complicated and she always takes the time to check in with me and how I'm doing not just physically but emotionally! She's amazing!|After my appointment today I don't think ive ever been more frustrated and disappointed.

Dr. Faltas has been amazing and truly cares. I highly recommend him. That's who I thought I was seeing today but apparently not. 5/5 stars for him!

Had I known I was seeing Alexis Bolick -PA I would have rescheduled because she did nothing my first visit with her.

Alexis (who I've seen once in the past and all she did was offer me weed which is the only thing I've ever declined for treatment) literally asked me ""what would you like me to do today for you?"" I literally thought she was kidding so I didnt answer...until I realized she was serious.
Also said ""I don't know what to do for you.""
Literally how the 5 minute appointment ended.

I didn't realize I'm supposed to do your job for you. In my opinion I feel like she does not care and wasted my time. Not to mention driving is uncomfortable and to drive there for her to shrug it off. I dont live close by any means. She would see that if she looks at the questionnaire I fill out before every visit. You can see I'm tired because I don't sleep at night because of the pain. You can see clear as day that my MRI proves why I have excruciating pain. For 4 years I've been in pain nearly every day. I have tried everything they have ever recommended (minus weed). Also mention I have never asked for narcotics or anything!! Last time I had any narcotics was for kidney stones almost 10 years ago. So maybe she thinks I'm a drug seeker?

My most recent MRI now shows I need surgery to remove a vertebrae which will hopefully happen in 1-2 months but until then she just wants me to continue to be in excruciating pain until someone else can help me. You went to PA school to help people with pain and today I felt like I was wasting your time but in reality you wasted mine & caused more pain.

How my appointment ended:
With complete frustration & feeling hopeless.|She's really great and professional and makes you feel very comfortable....i like her attitude and how friendly she is... she's a great provider...|Allie Gliadon is such a great doctor. Very clear and knowledgeable and most important a caring and considerate listener.|I'm happy to say Alexander's suggestion to go with the SprintPNS after seeing my MRI is a good suggestion.

She's awesome. But when they don't have any openings I come to this location. I have read some of the reviews for this place. I can say I've only been to this location a few times, but I've never had any problems with anything or anybody here. As I said I usually go to the Burnsville location. Every location that I have been to treats me with dignity and respect. As a recovering heroin addict it's very difficult to control my pain but they have me on Methadone which is an absolute life saver for me as it's been keeping me away from ""H"" but they also have me on Oxy for my pain. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my pain cuz they specialize in addiction too. I absolutely love this company. Thanks to Lindsey, Ellie, Christina, Amanda and Dr. George for trusting me and  listening to me and treating my pain. I would not go anywhere else for pain management.|This place is a joke.  The sheer level of incompetence borders on malice towards its patients. appointments that were made months out are rescheduled  or just cancelled unilaterally, with no advanced notice, for no reason at all -- and this is a regular occurrence.  The doctors regard their patients with suspicion and open hostility, refusing to meet reasonable requests with zero explanation. The staff answering the phone are rude and unhelpful. Avoid at all costs.|I'm a PCA for my mother I called to follow up about a referral for her it was fairly urgent a men who didn't speak well English kept telling me what referral she had I told him I didn't understand him. I made it clear I needed someone else on the phone he put me on hold and hung up! Don't go here if you don't have to.|This clinic is a joke.  They make statements that you can not trust and if something happens like a mistake is made because they refuse to just treat the patient totally and the family doc sends the wrong perscription in, they will drop you because they didn't just help you with your chronic and acute pain issues.  It's a really sad time in this day and age that they immediately think you are trying to get something over on them, but really it was a true mistake that could have been avoided by them just doing their job and treating the patient like a human being instead of expecting an issue.  I'm nor even the patient, but my 71 year old boyfriend was treated very badly, then just abandoned by these people.  Treated like a common criminal when they could have spoke to the family doctor to see what went wrong in sending a perscription.  Just beware, if you have acute pain and they tell you to see someone else for it, watch out, make real sure what happens is the absolute correct thing, because even doctors make mistakes, we are all human after all.  You can be dropped like yesterday's garbage.|I have been a patient there for over 2 years. The last 6 months have been pure HELL!! I have not done anything wrong.  Great pee tests. Sivili Vang is the provider.  Every month there is a problem with me getting my prescription.  She forgets to send it in. I call multiple times, and fight to get it. I had to drive into the office one time, for her to release it. This month, she didn't send it in. I called pharmacy to check on it. They didn't have it. This is on the day I was told by provider I could pick it up. 5:00pm, still not sent in. The stress is unbelievable.  If I run out, I'm in withdrawal.  This has turned into the biggest nightmare ever. I'm so disheartened in how this has become such a mess.

She researched and printed a coupon for my pharmacy and being someone on a fixed income every penny helps! She and everyone at the Woodbury location have always been great over  the years I have been getting treatment there.

(Not saying that every test will be like that, but faster than the community sites)|The registration and the testing process was quick and easy.

When unexpected issues arise they go out of there way to try and help. I've been to half a dozen pain clinics and this is my favorite one in the last 15yrs of my chronic pain. It would be a 5 stars but they sometimes forget to get prior Authorization started until after it expires which can obviously have u in withdrawal, which if ur familiar then u know how bad that is.|It is virtually impossible to get hold of anyone. I've called, texted. The only way to reach them is to go there, which is ridiculous. I've never experienced anything like it. I hope your experience is better than mine.|Been a patient for years. This is a pill farm. They do not do the whole body approach. They have horrific customer service, they don't answer phones or give any option for urgent contact for when they screw up your prescriptions. They've got me hooked on opiods and have SEVERAL times put me in danger by putting me into severe withdrawal and pain because they don't care to give proper contact info or reply when they screw up. I've gone all weekend without my meds and cannot get through to ANYONE that works for the company.  I now have to very unsafely drive 20 minutes while super sick to the actual office just to speak to anyone there. I do not feel safe here but have no options because They've got me hooked on specific pills that hardly anyone is able to prescribe. BEWARE. NEGLIGENT PILL FARM|It would be really helpful if you guys looked into better answering services as return phone calls for basics such as scheduling or answering questions about medication's has been a very slow and painful process.

It smelled like they previously smoked in the building, you could smell it as you opened the door and it got worse once you got through the entryway to the check-in desk. The music was so loud you can barely concentrate to fill out the paperwork.  Honestly I was only there 15 minutes I couldn't stay for my appointment, my chest hurt and I was having problems breathing.  So I can't say anything as far as how the provider was, but if you are sensitive to smells or have asthma do not go to the Burnsville location you will not be able to breathe.|I have been a patient at Valley Medical & Wellness since 2022, I started at the Burnsville location and was seen by Lindsay Bergstreser. My experience at first was great, I felt heard and understood, but the wait time to be seen was extremely long.

After about year, I experience financial hardship and I
returned to the Burnsville location for an appointment, and I was approached by the billing supervisor. I had been on a payment plan, but apparently the amount was not enough, and I was told it would be my last appointment. I asked if there was a way to work this matter out since I really like the provider I was seeing. The billing supervisor was rude but gave me an amount that I would need to agree to pay per month to stay at the clinic, I agreed to the amount, and she was going to go get a new contract written up for me to sign. She returned with the updated payment plan, but the amount was double than what we agreed to not even 10 minutes before hand. I questioned the amount, she said, I made a mistake on how much the monthly payment would need to be. I stated I could not afford that payment per month. The billing supervisor then said this would be your last appointment here then and walked out of the office.

At that point, I reached out the clinic manager regarding my concerns and experience with the billing supervisor. The clinic manager reviewed everything, and we were able to come up with an agreement that would work for both myself, and the company.

I started going to the Plymouth location since it was closer to my home. Lauren Holzfaster was the provider I was seeing at the Plymouth location, and I absolutely loved her! Everything was going great; I was making my weekly payments, but then I received the statement in the mail. The statement showed that none of my payments were being applied to my bill. I reached out to the billing team immediately and requested a detail bill summary of my billing history. After reviewing the statement, I had several questions. I was being charged different amounts for the same exact visit every month by the same provider. Where were my payments going for the past 2 months? I also paid out of pocket $350 for a visit due to no insurance, but the statement I received said I owed $350 to them for that appointment. I went back and forth several times with the billing supervisor and I was not having my questions answered, so I went back to the clinic manager.

The new clinic manager had to review everything again and said she would contact me within a week for updates, but meanwhile my weekly payments would be suspended until this was resolved. Three weeks went by, the billing team tried to charge my card twice. I reached out by Klara, no response. After several phone calls into the office, messages on Klara, I finally received a response from the clinic manager.

Basically, said that she found no errors in the billing and that my weekly payments would resume. Also, a new policy was made for patients without insurance would need to pay the day before hand or the appointment would be cancelled. I responded and asked for a copy of the updated policy due to the inconsistencies of the billing department. I also requested a phone call from the clinic manager because I had several questions without answers regarding the billing. I was promised a phone call, but the phone calls were never returned. Finally, the day before my appointment, she reached out. Once again, none of my questions for billing, she had any answers to, but was told this would be my last appointment at Valley Medical due to safety of my care and their ""business"".

I just wanted my questions answered, I had no problem paying the weekly amount that was agreed upon, but when a company can't answer a question on billing, it's very concerning. The provider as well, did not understand their decision on making this my last appointment. It's been very clear that Valley Medical could care less about patient care.|It does not get worse than this place. They don't call or message you back, they have not called in my meds multiple times, found lies in my medical records, it goes on. There is nothing like it, it's beyond terrible.  The lead doctor also has a dui. They are a risk to your health on so many levels.|Update 1-14-25

-- ANSWER your phone calls! I been waiting g 5 days for a response! I have left you message on klaara and I been on hold for 5 hours. Hire efficient workers!  You guys should be shut down. Your dealing with people's lives here!

I been waiting for a call back since Friday due to a smashed up foot and no one is taking it seriously.! I can't get pain meds from my local doctor because I'm in a pain contract with you!

All staff was excellent and treated me with kindness.|I went to the Burnsville Location- very nice location and easy to get to. However that was the only plus of my visit. I had been referred by a specialist at another clinic, AFTER being referred to the referring provider from another clinic, short story this is the 3rd specialist I have seen regarding my back. I have had multiple injections and even medial branch blocks and a radio frequency done, but yet this Dr told me there was nothing wrong with my back and all I needed was to exercise and do PT (mind you this is after he mentioned more then once how many times I have been seen by PT). He also stated my back in my MRI looked just fine even though there was obviously visible bulges in my back. All the provider did was touch my back, make me walk and bend. Hardly asked me any questions about the pain I'm dealing with. My referral also stated ""consult for pain pump or spinal cord stimulator"" neither of which were spoke about. All in all I would never go back here as I have been dealing with my back for 4 years now with multiple things already done and the provider completely blew me off and told me I was fine and to stretch (after I had specifically stated how hard it is for me to do so due to pain).|The medical side of this visit was great. The Dr was very personable and patient with questions. I only gave 4 stars because when we were in the waiting room after the appointment finishing up some paperwork, we noticed the girl at the desk had fallen asleep leaning against the wall while sitting in her chair. When we first arrived, she was also very distracted by her cell phone. These things made the facility appear unprofessional.|The doctor was very pleasant and helpful. He figured out my issue on the first visit and came up with a plan to get me off my pain meds for life. I'm looking forward to working with them. I tried other pain clinics and they didn't have the staffing and were reluctant to take my case. Twin Cities Pain Clinic was close to my house. Everyone was helpful and happy to assist me.|My visit today went very well, as always.

John Alt|I tried this place after moving to the area from another part of the country, and it was terrible. They only care about self enrichment. Their primary goal is to bleed you and your insurance dry. They will blow a hole in your budget whether you have in-network coverage or not. Their administrative staff are very nice, but the providers did not care about my well-being whatsoever. They recommended the most expensive diagnostic procedure and disregarded my previous doctor's treatment plan that worked well. They will try force you to do as many office visits as possible and abruptly make you do 'diagnostic' lab tests on the spot. They charge quite a lot for an office visit that mostly involves them reading a you prepared questionnaire. I 100% do not recommend.|My virtual visit went smoothly as always. I was able to get my meds refilled. We discussed my treatments going forward I was reminded to make sure I made another appointment for next week. I had an excellent visit and am thankful for the virtual visits|Erin was extremely informative about how to look at the options for my future care. She put my mind at ease!  Great visit!

I've also seen Bethany Miller at Maplewood, she's fantastic as well.  She took her time explaining a procedure and how it works in my body. Bethany is thorough and willing to help me in my special circumstances.   Very professional, I value that!  I feel lucky to have found these outstanding people!|Dr. Haas is wonderful and very caring.  She, and my other providers at the TC Pain Clinic continually work with me to find the solutions that help.  The entire staff is very kind and the care is terrific.  I can't say enough positive things about the TC Pain Clinic and I am grateful to be able to work with them.|Kierstin Durie introduced herself to my wife and me, and we are pleased that she will be our TC Pain service contact going forward. We hope this arrangement will be stable for a  while (we have been shuffled around to a new TC Pain  person with every new appointment beginning last summer.)
Kjerstin was very accommodating, pleasant and professional, and we look forward to working with her.
Thank you!
Al Seymour|Just another clinic that talks patients into procedures and then provides no follow up care or takes any responsibility for the decisions they talk their patients into.

Edit: As a follow up, they've now corrected their mistake to the best of their abilities but this is our ""final"" visit as they are only for ""intervention medicine"" not chronic....

Funny, considering what caused all of the trouble is that you made us sign a pain contract... which is for chronic, right? Then when we were forced to go to the hospital due to pain you said it was ""acute"" and not your responsibility even though the Dr. there stated it was ""100% due to the procedure"" and he wouldn't help because the clinic should...

So you signed us up for a procedure, went on vacation, ignored/ didn't respond to our repeated calls and messages and then when we finally talk to someone about what's going on... your receptionist starts repeating your messages verbatim back to us while being offended that I told her we would have to call back due to the Dr who was actually taking care of my wife needing to speak to us...

This place is about as unprofessional and irresponsible as they come. They value their time over your well being, lack planning and then when you call them out on it, they lie and say they don't deal with chronic pain anymore.

I'm glad though, we weren't planning on continuing to use your services anyway as you seem to be incapable of managing patient care anyway. As a warning to anyone who took the time to read this, ask questions about all stages of your procedures and make sure they have a pain management plan in place, cause they'll ignore it and blame you for their mistakes. Good luck and avoid this place if you can!",2025-02-24|2023-08-18|2024-10-27|2024-12-05|2024-09-29|2024-09-28|2025-01-17|2024-08-23,5|4|1|5|5|5|4|1,,,"1 p.m.|11 a.m.|12 p.m.",56.8|56|56,"Onsite services, Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, Free parking lot, On-site parking","Do you accept new patients?","Yes, we are always accepting new patients at all our clinic locations.

And that was when he referred me to Dr. Saeger for some epidural steroid injections.

His staff all seem wonderful, caring,  and happy to work there, which says a lot.

The lady RN Evelyn started out with confrontation, and confusion of my appointment, I exclaimed to her, I was referred to DrParmele from a football professional. I also have a professional background. Not in sports.  Whoever Evelyn is on his staff treated me as if I needed ""recovery"" from excessive opioids. I wasn't in the market of bargain shopping. I was put on a reduction previously from a pain clinic for an infraction, as I went over the count due to re injuring myself loosing weight. She did not care to understand the whole and made the decision to completely ignore to hear about my physical conditions... I feel as if the ""opioid pandemic"" took over and she took her own personal view, in which had a complete influence on my care. I then finally met the DOCTOR, who was a Fabulous Man! I shared a short version of my major dump truck accident and that I had got ejected from an 81/2 ton dump truck 25 years ago. I flew out the driver's window and landed 73 ft into a corn field. I was looked at as an addict. I requested a lower dose then what was on and compromised . Only to return to the office with a completely different plan. I am now in my bed at home and can barely move. Thank you ISPINE. Your the best!|This doctor is absolutely amazing. He has done a few procedures in regards to my health, and he has been completely dedicated. He knows my medical history. He explains things to a certain degree to where you understand. Any question you ask he doesn't make you feel incompetent for asking, and he does his best to explain it.  He is 100% hands-down one of the best surgeons/doctors I've ever met and I would recommend anyone to go to him.|I've only met Dr. Parmele once so far but was impressed with his knowledge and professionalism.  I'm look forward to working with him and getting to know him better.|He is professional. He is personable. Kind and ever so thoughtful as we haven't had anything to eat or drink for many hours.   Thank you.|This was my first visit to iSpine.
This doctor was very personable and got right to the point in his questioning.  Initial screening was done by a paraprofessional staff member as is normal now days. Evelyn was very friendly and professional.  Doctor P. did not minimize my experience of chronic pain, nor talk down to me, but ordered an MRI ""to see what's going on"", plus offered a non-narcotic medication to mitigate my acute symptoms which has helped.  A further plan of care will follow the results of the MRI, I assume.  I expect to have a positive relationship with this clinic.|I was pleased with the care I received from his team.

Unlike my previous experiences at the Edina location, Dr. Tanner goes above and beyond to make me feel seen and heard. He takes the time to explain diagnoses in clear, understandable terms, ensuring I fully grasp what's going on with my health. I appreciate his proactive approach--he doesn't hesitate to expedite treatment when necessary and always makes me feel like an active participant in my care.

Everyone I've interacted with, from the receptionist to the scribe, has been genuinely pleasant and kind. The entire team creates a welcoming and supportive environment, which makes a significant difference. Thank you, Dr. Tanner and the whole team, for your professionalism, compassion, and dedication. I'm truly fortunate to have you all on my care journey.|I love Twin City Pain
Dr. Erin is an amazing doctor. I feel like she cares about my health. She is amazing. Thanks for caring. Oh Dr Haas is my surgeon she does a great job.|I have been gone for a few months after having some fusion on my lower spine,saw a new doctor Tanner and was very helpful as they usually are. Have only good thoughts about the doctors and the receptionist that I see when I go there monthly. Thank you very much|I greatly appreciate the care I've received from Dr. Pizanski and Tanner, PA, the nurses and all the other staff. I'm truly thankful for all they have done to help me with all the Cervical, Thoracic and SI joint pain issues. Their kindness, communication, and listening skills and referrals for surgeons is top notch. Their kindness I will never forget and anyone struggling with chronic pain be rest assured they will do their best to help you.|They listen, they ask, they analyze fully. They are encouraging of feedback and conversation. They are there for getting you the RIGHT care, not just taking your time and pain for granted to fill the books. I feel treated like a person here, not just another number like I have with other clinics. They are clear about OPTIONS and provide information without forcing you down a single path; this transparency allows for educated decisions to be made and opens up questions and conversation that might not otherwise be discussed with other doctors. They're not afraid to try diagnostics for complex matters or refer to other clinics in order to find root causes and find you the right care. They are looking for root problems and root solutions to ensure true care for the source of pain, not just covering up your symptoms. Online portal needs some serious work though.|I was nervous about the consult. But the ladies at the front desk was very kind. The round lady that took me back and did the pre visit was very nice. The doctor was very nice. They all answered my questions and made me very at ease. I normally get anxious but they was all easy going and I was as relaxed as I could be while in pain. They actually listen to you and answer your questions. So far so good|My experience with this consultant was deeply disappointing. After the appointment, I reviewed her notes from the initial assessment and was shocked to find multiple inaccuracies. She documented that I have urinary incontinence, vision and hearing loss, and elbow pain preventing me from getting off the floor--none of which I said or was asked about during the visit.

During the visit, Aimee made minimal eye contact and spent most of the time typing on her computer, despite having a scribe present. The interaction felt cold and impersonal, and there was no effort to truly understand my concerns.

For a practice that specializes in pain management, this lack of attention and professionalism is unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I left feeling unheard, frustrated, and completely defeated.  I will not be returning.

The only reason I am leaving a review is because they keep sending emails and text messages asking for them.|I met with Tanner, who is not my usual provider because I had a scheduling conflict
I've never been seen by him.  He took the time to familiarize himself with my condition
He was very prepared, knowledgeable and empathetic to my issues.  My normal provider Erin is wonderful.  Tanner, as well as EVERYONE at Twin Cities pain clinic couldn't be better in my opinion.

Carrie Van Overbeke was gentle and took her time during the interview and examination. I would recommend Twin Cities Pain Clinic to anyone.|I have received pain management services for years. I went to this clinic as it is near me and new to see what they offered. The NP was professional and the staff friendly. They have a specific process for intake (MRI etc.) and are committed to certain modalities ( use of pain pumps was prioritized) and are not interested in individualizing their approach. I got the impression the provider is only trained or authorized to follow one protocol.

I knew I was safe and in good hands. They even called me back a little later to check up on me as they were all worried.

I had seen an extensive number of doctors and dentists before I came here for facial pain. Although I already had a diagnosis before coming here this was the 1st place that explained my condition to me at length and with care and compassion! After years of complaining of facial pain and even being diagnosed Dr. Fricton was the first doctor to touch and physically examine my head, neck and inside of my mouth. He offered solutions that hadn't been presented to me before. When I arrived for my first appointment I was crying because I was in pain , I cried through most of the appointment because of pain but when I left I was crying because I finally felt like I landed in the right spot and I felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. I felt heard and I felt seen.

I always feel well cared for and confident in the treatment I receive. Highly recommend this office to anyone looking for quality healthcare!|I had a positive experience during my visit to Nura Pain Management Clinic. The staff were professional, attentive, and empathetic, ensuring a smooth and comfortable process from check-in to consultation. The medical team took the time to thoroughly understand my concerns and provided clear explanations of the treatment options available.

Overall, I appreciate the level of care and expertise provided by the team and would recommend the clinic to others seeking pain management solutions.
Thank you so much Dr. Peter Schultz and Nura Team.|Where do I start? I have called Nura in regards to this Bill. I've called billing and patient advocate that was over two weeks ago I have heard nothing. I had a back stimulator put in to my back. Which on the morning of my surgery the different leads from my husband's company that were supposed to be put in my back but with my knowledge Nura changed what leads were going into my spine with out telling me or my husband which Nura discussed apparently the night before my surgery but never called me the patient to tell me that I was going to get different leads. I was supposed to get 32 leads in my back from more coverage but I ended up only getting 16 leads in my back. And as of now the stimulator is not working at the braline and it's the entire reason I had surgery. it's been 2 months. Looks like possibly I needed more coverage my husband and I both feel that it's just a way for me to have another surgery to get two more leads put in so I have 16 more contacts. Which means more $$$$$.
I mean my God I was hit by an Ambulance at 75 miles an hour and pushed 250 ft down the highway! I should not even be alive!  Now back to the bill they sent me a bill for an appointment with a PA and a nurse which was $208. Which seems sufficient then a lady came in to fit a back brace she was in the room for under 5 minutes. They charged $1,400 and that had to be adjusted as it was run through insurance and they're now wanting me to pay almost $700 for a back brace that cost between 224 and 250. I actually called the company that makes the back brace plus it's all over the internet you can buy it pretty much anywhere same model same type exactly the same one that they sell. That is ridiculous that they're trying to charge patients this much. I mean I can just buy the back brace new and just return it to Nura.
Then when you have surgery with them they give you discharge papers that say a nurse or someone will be calling you the next day to check on you I've had two surgeries with them The Intercept procedure which I had to do awake because a nurse screwed up on what medications I could take I still have the voicemail and the spinal cord stimulator. Did anyone call me the next day. No. I've had five other surgeries in my life and every surgery I have someone calls the next day. Nura doesn't and makes you think they don't care. If Nura isn't going to do it then they need to remove it from their discharge papers. Maybe start running less ads on TV and hire more doctors and more nurses so that you can handle calling people the next day I'm personally I think your doctors are overworked make decisions without asking the patient and that is what happened to me.|Efficient scheduling and clinical visit. Staff was caring and helpful. Dr Peter Schultz knew my history and had reviewed my lab findings. He suggested treatment options that gave me hope|The efficiency for making our appointment was excellent. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and took great care and concern for my 89 year old mom! Dr Studt was professional with some added humor! I feel as if we have found the answer for my mother's back pain. Highly recommend Nura Pain Clinic|I felt like a pin cushion for their profit. They seemed more concerned with making money than actually helping me.

After a brief exam, the only care that was offered to me was injections or surgical spinal implants.  No physical therapy or other non-evasive options are offered.

Had a very painful injection that caused pain that lasted several months and then minimal temporary relief.  Then abandoned by the care team when results from the treatment plan were not positive.

After doing self-care physical therapy for a year my condition has slightly improved without painful injections or surgery.  They should have suggested this type of care plan for me, but that would have not made them money.

Your response doesn't align with the experience I had.  Your response is just a standard reply to the criticism of your clinic that highlights your ability to be unresponsive.|You need a better phone system. It is so hard to get a hold of anyone there and when you do, you have to sit on the phone forever waiting to talk to someone.  We deal with this all the time. Also my wife has a pain pump which she has to go in and get filled. Why does that have to take 3 hours every time this is performed. It is a ridiculous waste of time when and there should be no reason it can not be all completed in 30 minutes. Nothing changes each time I go, it's all routine but they have to stretch out the whole visit for three hours every time.|My mom's service was crap! They said that the referral that the other place gave Nura to get shots. The 2nd time she went up there, they said they couldn't find the referral.

The only downside is the bare bones waiting room with very uncomfortable chairs and the walk to the bathroom takes you to an abandoned part of the building that I believe is under construction.

The receptionist is warm and kind and friendly. The support medical staff is very professional and the PA that assisted me was very thorough and attentive in every way. I felt like I mattered there and my pain was addressed appropriately. This was my first appointment (from start to finish 2 hours and 30 min)|Very well organised; maintaining safety protocols. Detailed user-friendly step-by-step instructions.
The only drawback: one must have a smartphone to register and follow ""online"" instructions. Very smooth process. Staff there only facilitate the process; no input with form or queries regarding changes in registration (that is only online).
Suggestion: please add option of ""ID verification"" (passport number, national ID) in online form at time of registration, also with option (in reasons) for ""travel purpose"".  I would definitely have given FIVE stars IF the passport number and travel purpose option were already included in registration ... so they can be on printed report : essentially required by certain airlines for report to be ""valid"" (ID validated and ""time stamped"").|Shockingly fast and efficient!!! The whole thing seemed to take 2 seconds but they were highly professional and kind and in that brief time I felt cared for. I got there 3 minutes before my appointment and there were 4 cars in front of me. I left, test done, 7 minutes after my appointment time.  I felt like it was ""we got this and we got you!"" My results also came within 12 hours and as busy as labs are now that was also fantastic and unexpected. Superior rating! They have this thing down! Bravo to this clinic and the staff!|This testing site was very well run! We only had to wait a few minutes and the staff member was wonderful and put all of my kids at ease with the process. We drove up, gave our IDs, and he came back out and did the tests one by one for all of us in our car. We received our results back within 8 hours!|Quickest / easiest COVID testing experience I've had! Plus a very quick turnaround on your results. Emailed directions were easy to follow, but there was not any signage in the parking lot / on-site so that was a little confusing at first.|Very unprofessional. At my boyfriends very first appointment with this clinic the medical assistant showed him her breasts multiple times during his Zoom appointment. After reporting what happened to his doctor they didn't act surprised or shocked about what happened and acted like it wasn't a big deal and was just making excuses. This is absolutely disgusting that a clinic would even allow this to happen in the first place. As medical professionals you should know better!  - I know this story sounds insane and crazy but it really happened.
Edit to add: a few weeks after this incident happened we received a phone call asking for more detail on the situation. The person who called never apologized for what happened and instead accused my boyfriend of lying and making this up. Even though his doctor already admitted and confirmed it happened. Especially after them accusing us of lying I would never ever recommend anyone go to this clinic. This is disgusting behavior and I am still in shock you would allow this to happen.|Really love and appreciate the staff here. They took over my care when my previous MAT provider stopped seeing patients. They made it a very smooth and stress-free transition which ensured I didn't go without my meds.|Amazing services! I got a PCR test done. It was done right in my car without having to get out or park. The medical tech/nurse did a great job of taking the sample. She even did a nasal swab of my 6 month old and the baby slept right through it. We got our results within 7 hours! Definitely recommend this place.

Great service and caring about my issues and quality of life. Highly recommend.  Wait is worth it. Be serious about your expectations and actively participate to maximize your outcome. I will never be pain free but I am able to live my life the best I can. They care.|I have been a patient of this clinic for over 6 years. I had received great care from various physicians until they switched me to Weiya Ouyang, PA. She will not listen to your concerns, she will change your treatment plan and when you try to bring up how it has had a significant impact on your life, it doesn't matter. I asked the clinic to change physicians, but due to short staff, they wouldn't let me. I will not be returning to this clinic and called another clinic immediately to be seen.|All I can do is reiterate a lot of the reviews I'm seeing here. Since Dr Hess left I have been through countless employees, and I call them employees because none of them seem to be real doctors. When I did occasionally get one that seemed decent they were gone within a couple months. I see these people working at other clinics now so something must be scaring them off. The people I'm being seen by there all like to bad mouth their bosses (management). This gives me a very insecure feeling. I'm only going there to get my meds refilled which should be fairly simple but they complicate this and constantly try to change things around for me. I guess none of them ever heard the old saying that if it's not broken don't try to fix it. I have been going there every two to three months for over 5 years and now they just told me that management says that I need to be seen every month. For what? To talk about the nice weather? This almost seems like some type of an insurance scam to get more money from my insurance provider. There's absolutely no reason that I need to go there monthly to get a prescription filled. All that accomplishes is wasting my time, wasting the insurance companies money and forcing me to pay more co-pays. The last time I was there the nurse told me the doctor will be right with me as he is finishing up some injections with another patient. I thought to myself, that poor person. I wouldn't let these people draw blood from my finger let alone stick a needle in my back. All the doctors since Dr Hess been arrogant and plain rude. I was even told by one that if I didn't like how they were doing things then he will reduce my meds. Literally threatening me. As with any company you always see good and bad reviews but I'm wondering about the good reviews I'm seeing here for this place. No offense but are these people actually cognitive and aware of what's going on around them? I have dreaded going to this place for years now but kept going because it was only every 3 months and I could handle it. But now, contemplating going there every month has driven me to start looking for a new clinic and I hope to be out of there as soon as possible. To be honest, I feel that The person I'm seeing currently is just straight out lying to me and I really don't need to be going there every month. I think he just changed it to be an ass. I won't name names because I can't verify any of this but my instincts have always served me well my entire life and they are telling me now to move on. Normally I don't write such a long review but I sincerely feel that people need to know the truth about this place. If you are considering going to this facility I strongly recommend that you do your homework first. I mean think about it, how often do you see 3.0 reviews here. I normally don't even watch movies with less than a 4.0 rating.|United Pain Clinic should not be in business! the doctors there have no bedside manner, they place judgement right away! Don't give you a chance to be seen, heard or even feel worth their time! Save yourself the time, find another provider. Do your research , on the clinic, provider , ask a lot of questions. The thing I look at first are the reviews, they speak volumes. People who have gone through the experience know what they are talking about! United pain clinic is NOT a good place. Find another provider|I have been going to this clinic since 2012, Dr. Hess was my provider.. I adored him.. he listened to me. He tried to help in any way he could. He retired a couple years back, since then I have been through 5 providers at this clinic.. the 2 that I absolutely started to trust, and feel comfortable with has now left.. and I can tell you why.. you wanna know how I know? Because they told me why they were leaving
Having to stay until 7-8pm at night doing charting and whatever they as Dr's do! They were very unhappy working at the clinic!
The politics in the clinic!
The staff gossip about us as we're there, yes that happened as I was walking out the other day from appointment. I heard them!
So.. when the last one left I asked for his recommendation, so I took their recommendation and now that one is complaining about staying late..
I have never in the past 12 years EVER missed an appointment.
Had a bad UA
Never had a miss count la on my pain meds count never over or short!
I do not Dr. shop, I do not get scripts from anywhere else ( pain meds)
Then let's talk about the medication.. yup you guessed it! They want to keep cutting back on my meds.. I am at the bottom of what my pain level can go.. I hurt 24/7 I have CRPS, a torn root cuff I need a complete shoulder replacement,
I have arthritis that has spread from arm/shoulder to neck, and because of my CRPS no surgeon will touch me for fear of my CRPS spreading further!
I went down a lot in meds so I explained to the new provider of all the medication that I weened down/off of.  You know what she said!?
I will tell you!
1) I was told the clinic keeps getting red flagged for the amount of pain meds that they prescribe
2) She told me that the "" upper management "" is telling all providers to let patients know this.. in other words ( guilt) the patients for needing pain medication and pain management! To make the clinic look better!
3) and then she said, patients can "" appeal"" the decision if they keep getting meds cut back/off
I have never felt so low as I did when I left the clinic the other day, I cried all the way home.. why do they call themselves a "" pain center"", if they're not going to help their patients?
Why guilt us in taking away our medication to make them look better?
I have no idea what to do, the clinic needs new management or some type of re branding because this is not right for us pain patients that do not use or abuse our medication.|So disappointed in this facility. Had to change Dr's again for the 5th time because they all have left & the new one I got treated me horribly. Took it upon herself to ween me down when I said no. Been suffering ever since, ""Dr said your brain will take over the pain"" you should be ashamed of yourselves.  No one should suffer in pain & this clinic lost all there caring Dr's. I have suffered in pain for 35yrs. Even my primary Dr is appalled. This clinic has lost all my respect & me as a patient! My primary care said he won't let me suffer in pain. I use to like United pain clinic, but they do not listen to the patient. They don't care like they use to & it's a shame. I will be reaching out to the medical board and the ombudsman to file a complaint.|This office constantly has staff changes. The staff themselves complain they have staff leaving and it's hard even see a real Dr. They're always scheduling me to Physician's Assistants who can only do so much. They canceled my last appointment the morning of due to the provider being out due to being sick. Instead of trying to help me with my problem or find a solution she told me 3 times to go somewhere else and get a second opinion after being at that clinic for about 10 years.|I've been dealing with chronic pain for decades and I haven't been able to seriously find relief until I went here. The staff are so nice and friendly and my Doctor is very caring and doesn't over prescribe anything. They go by the book and make you as comfortable as can be when receiving any injections. I absolutely love them!!! If you're suffering from any chronic pain degenerative disorders they have everything to ease the pain. I would highly recommend this clinic for anyone suffering.",2025-02-21|2025-02-16|2025-02-27|2025-01-29|2024-12-04|2024-11-18|2024-11-23|2024-06-12,5|1|1|1|1|1|1|5,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|11 a.m.",73|71|62.2,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","I am absolutely disgusted by United pain clinic,  my brother had a brain tumor and he got that for fighting for OUR COUNTRYand  they refused him meds and he shot HIMSELF HOW DARE THEM!","I have been working with the Mpls va for back pain, fracture vertebrae, ruptured disc.

Dear Dr. Andrew Will,
Pain management Nurse Bethanie Miller referred me to an NON TCPC pain clinic doctor to ask him to write my pain medication prescriptions. I am on an PAIN CONTRACT WITH TCPC. TCPC Owner Dr. Will, is this what is professional and ethical or the complete opposite? Please respond to me.
CNP Bethanie Miller  had no issues whatsoever suggesting and scheduling me immediately for multiple treatments and  surgical procedures but is now unwilling to allow me the life saving medications I need to have some quality of life and to even be able to go to your surgery center to have the surgical procedures done.
During my last two visits my new pain management provider, Nurse Bethanie Miller, advised me without any testing whatsoever that my ""receptors"" are not functioning properly and decided without any input from me or my patient advocate that she will start tapering my pain medications down. I am extremely debilitated by pain and extreme exhaustion resulting from multiple chronic pain syndromes and diseases that Twin Cities Pain Clinic have diagnosed me with including fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, TMJ / TMD, chronic tension and migraine headaches persisting daily for 15+ years, allodynia, spondylosis with myelopathy, osteoarthritis and ME/CFS. I had my advocate drive some information to CNP Bethanie Miller along with a video which explains the unbearable pain I suffer from. Although this information was sent and she claimed to have reviewed the information and watched the video she insists that my ""receptors"" are not functioning properly and told me that she plans to cut my pain medication down by nearly 1/2.  I have given her time to explain her theory and made a point to explain to her that medically and professionally this is simply a theory. There is no proof whatsoever that this is what is actually happening. No testing at all has been done to test my ""receptors"" and I patiently and politely explained to CNP B. MILLER  that the relief I experience from my medically necessary prescription medications can bring me from a level 8-9 pain down to a level 1-2 pain. I went on to tell her that if my receptors, as she says, are not working correctly,  I wonder how I am  experiencing such immense  pain relief taking my medication as prescribed.

I would so greatly appreciate if you would please take a few moments at your convenience to reach out to my care taker and I. We will be hopeful to hear from you in the near future. You may call, text, email at your convenience 24/7. Messages are always fine as well, although  we hope to speak with you in person (phone )  and think that would be most convenient and helpful to resolve this issue .

THANK YOU DOCTOR WILL!
Very Warmest Regards,
TSB and JSB|After months of pain, multiple injections and a botched experience from another physician, I changed course altogether.  I lucked upon Dr. Will at Twin Cities Pain.  After the first appointment I knew that I had found something. Dr Will wasn't counting the clock and rushing through the interview...he actually listened.  We went through my entire history, discussed what had worked, and what had failed. Together, we developed a plan and we put it in motion.

Now, several weeks into the treatment plan, the personal service has not faltered.  I am confident more than ever that my days of debilitating back pain are soon to be gone (or at least manageable).

These folks rock!|Dear Dr. Andrew Will (PART 3)
ME/CFS is a biological illness that affects many body parts. It causes severe fatigue not improved by rest, problems thinking and sleeping, dizziness, pain, and many other symptoms.

People with ME/CFS may not look sick but can't do their normal activities. ME/CFS may get worse after they do any activity -- physical or mental. This symptom is called post-exertional malaise (PEM). After they exert themselves, they may need to stay in bed for an extended time. About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are confined to bed at some point in their illness.

Did you know?
It's estimated that between 836,000 and 3.3 million people in the United States suffer from ME/CFS. More than 9 in 10 people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed by a doctor. ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $18 to $51 billion annually in medical costs and lost income.
It is difficult to diagnose because there is no specific test for ME/CFS. One reason that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed may be limited access to healthcare. Another reason may be a lack of healthcare providers who know about ME/CFS and how to recognize it.

Anyone can get ME/CFS. It doesn't matter what age, gender or ethnicity they are. However, some groups are more affected than others.

Signs and symptoms
People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill. They may not always be able to do daily tasks like showering or cooking a meal.

ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life. ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability.

ME/CFS is most common in people in middle age but also affects kids, teens and elderly people. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Among children, teens are more affected than younger kids.

People who are white are diagnosed more often than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among people from racial and ethnic minority groups.

Diagnosis
Symptoms of ME/CFS may appear similar to many other illnesses. There is no test to confirm ME/CFS. This makes it difficult to diagnose. The illness can also be unpredictable. Symptoms may come and go, or there may be changes in how severe symptoms are over time.

A doctor should be able to distinguish ME/CFS from other illnesses by doing a thorough medical exam. This includes asking many questions about the patient's health history and current illness. They should also ask about how often symptoms occur, how bad they are, and how long they have lasted. It is also important for doctors to talk with patients about how the symptoms affect their lives.

Treatment and recovery
There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS. But some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some people with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also help.

People with ME/CFS, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first after discussing possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies.

Healthcare providers need to support their patients' families as they come to understand how to live with this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process is likely to be hard on people with ME/CFS.

We paid 2 months at $1800 extra Cobra Insurance to keep our deductible already paid when we came here and they were in network. They did six block injections and then nerve ablations burning on three. Insurance came back saying it was an unproven procedure and would not pay it and said I did not have to pay it. Call the billing person here and they said they have seen this before and no I would not have to pay it. So why 3 months later are they still trying to get $10,000 out of me. That procedure caused me new excruciating pain that I still get sharp pain in my neck 4 months later. I screamed so bad on the table with a needle in my neck that I scared a lady down in the waiting room. They don't tell you that it can cause new and more pain than what your trying to get help for. I'm 63 years old and in chronic back pain. What a way to treat a person.
Minus 5 stars!|If I could give zero stars, I would. I waited for over an hour and a half in the waiting room. The doctor saw me for 15 minutes and basically just explained the procedure for a knee injection. All information that could've been on the website. Instead, I wasted 2.5 hours with the 30 min. drive to Edina. But, he got $210 from my insurance company for that 15-minute conversation! Nice scam they've got going on there.|Before the procedures I had very bad pain in my hip and knee joints. The pains were so strong that I could not go down or up the stairs because my legs would not bend. At night my hip joints ached. My doctors told me that the only way out was surgery. Dr. Starchook offered me a less drastic option -- adding stem cells to the problem sites. I agreed gladly. I received two first shots in November 2017 (one to the knee and the second to the hip). After a week the pain improved and I began to walk more easily and was more mobile than before the procedure. A month later in December I received two more shots in my hip and knee as well. A month after the second procedures, the acute pain was gone, but I still could not move quickly. I felt a full recovery only after three months. Last summer, I worked very hard physically, carrying heavy loads while gardening without any problems. This is the second year and I feel like I was born again. I lost weight, feel younger, even look younger than my peers. I want to thank the doctor and his staff for helping me so much, wishing them good luck in treating suffering people! Thank you!|I am 60 years old.  I found Dr Starchook in January while doing an internet search to find resources to help relieve my osteoarthritis knee pain - it was becoming very difficult to walk and exercise because of the severe pain in both of my knees.  After my initial consult with Dr Starchook, I was immediately impressed by his knowledge, his years of experience, his prestigious awards for being chosen MN Doctor of the year and his kind caring honest concern for his patients.

So... January 25 2018 I had my first stem cell procedure completed on my left knee and scheduled my right knee for 6 weeks later.  It was amazing!  After a few weeks, the pain started to diminish in my left knee and every week I would notice a difference in the level of pain from my right knee.  I was improving every week!!  Yesterday I had my right knee injected and I am so happy with my results!!

I am thrilled and beyond grateful to the whole staff at Twin Cities Pain Management that I chose to have the stem cell procedure before I was forced to have a surgical operation for a knee replacement!  This was truly a blessing for me to have found Dr Starchook!|I had the bone marrow harvesting stem cell therapy on my foot on 4/13/18 after a severe wound to my heel and another wound in the middle of my foot from chronic neuropathy that i was seeing a vascular podiatrist since june of 2017. i couldn't put any weight on it as i had a rolling knee scooter and the wound would open again and again. it's 5/4/18 and since the stem cell procedure it really is amazing that my foot looks like a normal foot again from how much the skin healed in 3 weeks. I've been a patient of Dr. Starchook for around 2 years now and he's a great Dr. and has a wonderful staff. i'm really excited i'm already putting some weight on it. i'm optimistic about my foot now when not too many months ago losing my foot all together if it would not heal and i'm only 39 years old.

an update on my stem cell therapy on my left heel, it has remained closed since the april 2018 procedure. i then had a similar problem with my right heel and a problem with my right big toe, the photos are graphic but the results have been amazing, the befores are late october 2018, the procedure was around thanksgiving and the afters are january. i can bear weight on my foot again this is incredible.|I was very pleased with my experience at Twin Cities Pain Managment. Dr. Starchook and his staff were extremely professional and caring. Had having years of pain in my lower back, it was a relief knowing that I had options and the doctor took the time with me explaining all of my options and any expectations. I would highly recommend anyone that is suffering with pain to visit Twin Cities Pain Management and know there is help out there for you. I wouldn't go anywhere else!|I had 3 injections done between my back and hip - fantastic results. It feels like some of it is getting even better with time.

The Dr works diligently to figure out each patient's specific health situation and what best treatment fits his needs!|I am very thankful for this niche practice, that specializes in helping clients with disc issues. I knew I had back issues and never realized there was this kind of specialist until I met with Dr. Antoine. There services are top notch and especially care about there clients! You are not a number, you are a patient at this practice. I am so very thankful for what they do. I feel so much better after 4 weeks of therapy! I highly recommend them. Thank you!|I have a list of issues I'm dealing with due to some very serious injuries in my early 20s. I've broken 10 vertebrates in my back and have 19 rods in my back that still to this day cause pain and discomfort. Overall I was progressing pretty well since my car accident but always lived with consistent pain, migraines, and nerve pain. It was expected with the type of injuries I had sustained to my back and shoulders but just about 4 months ago in January 2022 I had to face yet another difficult physical challenge that completely took me out of just about everything from work to even the most minimal tasks. I had nerve pain so bad down my legs I barely could walk and my feet would go numb from sitting even 5-10 minutes. I dealt with it for about a month of misery before realizing something serious was going on and I needed to get treatment or surgery. I came across Select Health while doing research and figured I'd give it a chance. I appreciated the honesty and transparency in my first meeting and after getting an MRI I found out I had degenerating discs(@27 years old) and 3 of which were herniated/torn/bulging to go along with my 10 broken vertebrates. I'm not going to sit and tell you that I'm 100% better after 2 months of treatment at select health and I probably never will be 100% with the injuries I have. But these 2 Doctors have been amazing to work with and the treatment they do here is truly life changing. I've been feeling some great progress since I started and it only seems like every week gets a little better. You can't come in expecting to be 100% healed but you can expect to see some great progress and healing throughout your
time here! Both of the doctors are super genuine and great to work with, and the technology they're using is awesome(I'd buy this technology myself if I could afford it hah) I look back on how miserable I was in February compared to where I'm at now and it's truly a blessing for me to see how far I've come. I'm very thankful for these guys and will most likely continue a maintenance plan on my back and neck/shoulders to help the healing process because I see the value at Select health! Last thing unrelated to my disc issues, I suffered from debilitating migraines for about 5 years and when a migraine hits I wanna cry it's so hard to deal with, I noticed since coming here I have NOT gotten a migraine which is officially the longest stretch( 70 total days) in 5 years I have gone without getting a migraine. For someone who was getting them once every other week sometimes multiple in one week, that in itself made coming here worth it. Hopefully this stretch continues and I only see more healing in my lower back and neck as well. If you're on the fence about coming here just do it!!! I don't think you'll regret it. Thank you Dr James and Jamy! Love you both and appreciate you guys more than you know!|I've had severe lower back and neck pain for over 15 years, that had gotten progressively worse as time went on. I spent thousands of dollars and tried various treatments suggested by different doctors to no avail, and no one was able to help me until I came to Asuda Health. Not only did they help alleviate the symptoms and pain for both  my neck and back, but a special blood test was ordered for me because I wasn't feeling well and they was discovered that I am gluten intolerant and am suffering from Leaky Gut condition. I have modified my diet already and feel so much better than before and have a lot more energy. It was money well spent and I am so grateful to both Dr. James and Dr. Antoine for their care in making me healthier. I haven't felt this good in years.|After being in the worst pain of my life, I came to the Disc Institute after a doctor's appointment where I was told that surgery was my only option for relief. After my MRI and consultation with Dr. Antoine, and realizing I had a severely herniated disc with other disc issues, I decided to enter a 12-week program and I've very happy to say I'm 90% recovered and still improving. The staff is very friendly, and each treatment is enjoyable. It took about 4 weeks for me to start seeing improvement, but I'm thrilled that I avoided back surgery!|I am beyond thankful for Dr. Jamy and his team.  I choose Select Health in 2019 as an alternative to having surgery for a herniated disc that was causing extremely painful sciatic nerve pain and numbness in my lower leg and foot.   I wasn't able to sleep, sit, drive, or walk long distances without extreme pain.    As a mom of two young children this injury was affecting me physically and mentally since I wasn't able to participate in our family activities.  After 6 weeks at Select Health I was 75% better.  After completing 3 months of therapy I was completely out of pain.  Recently, I had a flare up and returned to Select Health.  I have experience the same healing.  After 2 months I am completely pain free and have returned to all my normal activities.  I highly recommend giving Select Health a chance. It has been life changing for me and I am so thankful for this alternative to surgery!|I came to Select Health of Edina after suffering for three years with severe neuropathy, sciatica, and spinal stenosis resulting from a bulging disk in my lower back. The chronic, painful journey took me through two spine clinics, three physical therapists, two steroid injections, and ridiculously high doses of gabapentin and nsaids.
I was so very fortunate to find Dr. Antoine and his associates at Select Health. I was a perfect candidate for the state-of-the-art Sanexes electric cell signaling, Lumbar decompression, and cold laser treatments. I began to feel relief immediately, knowing my issues were being treated at the source. After only two months, I have achieved 80% improvement in both back and nerve pain.
At Select Health of Edina, the treatments are scientifically proven and real. If you are looking for the end of your journey to find true relief and healing, Select Health of Edina is the final destination.|I was desperate for help for my polysensory neuropathy and balance issues. I've been sick for the last four years and I've tried numerous  integrative therapies but nothing seemed to work until I came to Select Health! In just 8 weeks of treatments I've noticed more changes than I have in the last four years and I know it's just the beginning but I'm so thankful for this team. It's a miracle I stumbled upon their  page and decided to give them a try. They will listen and give you their honest opinion if they think they can help you or not!

I think all pain patients can agree that there is a component of passive suicidal ideation that exists in our daily lives for the sheer fact that we are in so much pain, constantly. A doctor I trust very much referred me to this clinic. I was assigned to Meatta Gaypia upon getting past the initial referral paperwork. I was told they had all kinds of modalities that I've never even tried or heard about, I was sold a vision. I didn't buy it entirely, but I was thrilled at the prospect of my pain going from a 9/10 to a 7/10. I would take any improvement and participate in whatever they asked of me. I'd already tried the most extreme options at other pain clinics, like a pain pump and a spinal cord stimulator. I was sold hope, as long as I held up my end of the deal. I've since been a patient with her for over a year and I'm discouraged to report that the only thing we've accomplished is to put me on Emgality. Due to difficulties with my insurance and the lack of followthrough with the clinic, I got to take one dose. In over 13 months. For a medication I didn't even request, one that doesn't address the reason I went there in the first place, thoracic pain. I had monthly appointments with her in addition to other visits to pain psychology and PT (which I'd already been in for years. They took me from a PT guy I loved to a different system that was terrible.) In all that time, the only thing Meatta Gaypia did besides that, was to talk about adjusting my gabapentin and lyrica. She didn't even glance at my chart to see I've already been maxed out on them for many years. Yet, she still brings up messing with my lyrica and gabapentin at every visit. She just goes around in circles and makes lots of excuses. She has no personal accountability and is downright rude. Her bedside manner is nonexistent. I don't want her to kiss my ass, just treat me with the same dignity as we'd want for ourselves or any other human. In the end, she referred me to another person in the clinic and told me that's what they do there, referrals for other things at other clinics, like spinal injections. Where are all these homeopathic and groundbreaking treatments they said they could offer? I like the support staff at the clinic though, they seem to work very hard. I feel like I wasted a year and some change on Meatta as a doctor, I'm very disenfranchised right now. I have only said this about one other doctor in my life, who eventually was charged with a crime. ::Meatta should not be practicing medicine:: She's dangerous to people, straight up. She will waste your time, bait you into arguments, and push you closer to the edge. People's lives are in her hands and she thinks nothing of it. At our last appointment she said she never realized I had passive suicidal ideations everyday. I have it in my notes from every single session and the paperwork I submitted to them, that I felt this way. Over a year telling her about these ideations and how they relate to pain, and nothing. It was so discouraging and underwhelming to know that she's glossed over those details for quite some time. This woman does not care whether people live or die. I realize that's harsh, but it's true. She needs to be in a different position where she is not facing the general public, like a clinical pharmacist at a compounding lab, not working with people. Could not be more disappointed with my experience. I do have recordings and I'm happy to share them with anyone. I'd release my rights as quick as you can sign up for a streaming service. For those in pain, I would try a different doctor. The jury is out on this clinic as a whole, but I would certainly avoid ending up in her care, if I were you.|The pain clinic has really helped me on my journey and deal with chronic pain. The renovations are nice. If you are dealing with chronic this is a great place to check out.

You may need a referral, but I've had a great experience here.|The doctor I worked with was the nicest and most understanding doctor I've worked with after 5 back surgeries and 3 hand surgeries she really helped me understand the pain I deal with everyday Neyata is awsome I probably spelled it wrong|I would actually give a minus 5-star rating if possible.  My girlfriend, who is in incredible pain constantly from a major stroke, wasted her time here with numerous visits over a long period only to not have her pain reduced one iota.  We explained to Dr. Ferron and Dr. Clavelle that her pain was an even bigger contributor to her poor quality of life than the fact that her left arm and leg are paralyzed and she has to reside in assisted living.  They kept making adjustments to her meds.  They refused to give her a PRN for the Norco that had worked for her, and instead kept playing around with adjusting her Lyrica and Gabapentin to absolutely no avail.  When we finally complained that there had no improvements and zero results from their treatments, they pushed her off to another facility.  WASTE OF TIME!!  My girlfriend missed or cut short many family outings and holidays due to their ineffective treatment, and now she has to start all over|Pain is a very VERY complex condition to ""treat"" and there is a LOT of money to be made by pharmaceutical companies and orthopedic centers. If you are looking for a quick ""fix,"" injection, or procedure that will make you feel better; this is probably not the place for you.

Do yourself a favor and read The Way Out by Alan Gordon and Alon Ziv.

I first met Georgia as a pain psychologist (private practice) in 2009 after being hit by an oncoming car on while riding my bicycle. It was the suggestion after hundreds of appointments, injections, chiropractic care, and physical therapy. I distinctly remember scoffing at the idea of ""welcoming the pain""

Fast forward 10+ years and hundreds of additional appointments for more MRIs, injections, medications, and physical therapy all attempting to help with multiple herniated disks. Neuropathy, burning, uncontrolled twitching, intense pain, and lack of sleep... I was at the point of giving up when I reached out to Georgia in an act of desperation and learned about Riverway Pain Clinic.

Since re-engaging with Dr. Ferron, Georgia Panopulous, Dr Clavel, and recommended physical therapy with Grant Kaper I finally feel like I have a good pain management plan. It has been hard work, takes daily effort, and I feel better than I have in YEARS.|The reviews speak volumes. There are some positive ones, I wish that would have been my experience. Dr. Meatta has no business being a ""pain management"" Dr. Her bedside manner is condesending, lacks care and any kind of compassion. Dr. Ferron is incredibly educated and can be valuable to understand what the use of pain medication can do and does to your body currently and long term. She should be a professor not a Dr. The program makes sense and I was on board and still am,just not at this Clinic. I cried most times leaving my appointments. I felt no concern for how I was adjusting to the reduction in medications I have been taking for 13+ years. She too was condesending, threatening and I felt like she was holding my meds over my head if I didn't do exactly what she said. Programs I couldn't afford, that I made perfectly clear but she didn't care. Continued to try to force me to do them all. I felt like a statistic not a 60 year old women looking to establish new care after moving to Minnesota from Texas. The ladies at the front desk are professional and caring.|Helped me understand my pain. I work with Dr. Ferron, Georgia & Scott and they took different approaches to helping me. I have seen countless doctors & physical therapist over the last 10 years (and I'm only 36!) and I refused to accept the ""this is your life now, nothing can be done"" response I received from other clinics. Dr. Ferron tried medications I have never tried before, and also gave me a diagnosis, something I had been looking for, for so long. This was the most relief I have ever found. Scott also was able to teach me stretches that have never been offered up to me before and ones that cater to my specific limitations and/or strengths, and Georgia is extremely empathetic, kind, caring and helpful, focusing on the individual instead of a cookie cutter regimen. The staff listened and saw me as a person and not just another patient, understanding that pain affects people differently and treatments aren't a one size fits all and I think that helped them find a treatment plan tailored to me, and they still keep trying to help me improve. I am not 100% pain free, but they have been able to give me the most relief that I have been able to find, and they keep working on trying to help me get even better. I definitely recommend the clinic if you have tried others without any progress.|Worthless place. Staff doesn't know how to do their jobs. Therapist Google stretches and does not have the proper equipment. The Dr. Will order test and then never go over them with you. When the test results come in the staff can't find them when they are on their own system. This is an all in 1 way to get as much money from you as possible while providing no positive results. I would not recommend this place for your dog.",2025-01-02|2024-05-02|2024-06-04|2022-11-09|2022-12-07|2019-01-11|2017-11-01|2016-01-30,1|5|5|1|5|1|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ05CDQKg-s1IRppuadHpXcvs,17

This would change without your knowledge. You would still get texts stating it was the scheduled therapist and you would get texts to rate your therapist, which you did not see as it changed.  This did cause some conflicting information to be given from appointment to appointment and I feel it hindered anyone from truly getting an understanding of what was going on with me.

The doctor seemed knowledgeable but was rude, demeaning and made me feel unimportant.

There was a real lack of communication as a whole. Who to contact if you had questions, how to reach them, how to reach the clinic, or who to contact for other services set up like MRI, injections etc.  No one ever gave phone #'s or said, "" if you have questions, call this number.""  ""If you need to cancel or change this appointment, call this number.""|Jake takes time to listen to your concerns.

He exhibits a vested interest in my health, is supportive, engaged, always positive, and present. He knows his stuff and if I ask something he can't confidently answer, he will find the answer.

Then the PT never touched me or even looked up from her computer screen to check my form or give me pointers on what muscles to make sure I was engaging. She gave me a book of rudimentary exercises (knowing I have already done 9 months of PT and that I'm very active and know a fair share about anatomy) and they just base their whole program on two dusty machines rather than thinking outside of the box, using their hands, or connecting the anatomical dots.

All of the providers that I did very well with~they were very focused on individual care, with empathy and empowerment, left. In just my time there, they have had one massive loss of providers at the clinic. Then again a smaller loss in within a year or so. I've been assigned 4 new providers since I started there a couple of years ago. My most recent provider is extremely rude. After each subsequent visit she has become more outlandish. She does not ask before she starts touching, or LITERALLY poking into me, 8 times in one shot. Leaving me with 2 bruises. I had to tell her ""stop, your bruising me"". As I stopped reacting to her firm poking, I caught her face and she had an odd smile on her face-VERY creepy. I did NOT even ask. It was too strange. She is very abrasive, accusatory, demanding, unyielding, judgemental and unable to communicate in a normal fashion. She actually began a prolonged verbal abusive assault that went on so long that I had asked her 4 times to stop yelling which she ignored. She continued her assault until I went to turn on my phone to record her since I didn't have anyone coming to stop her or help me. When she saw the phone, she quick finished a sentence and RACED out of the room to try to avoid a recording. The conclusion of my visit was like a continuation of a very bad dream. A hush fell when she left the room, and when I left. They heard her and nobody did a thing. Do not go here. Bullies. Dr. Anderson is the exception just as other's have written. I would imagine he is holding up the walls there after reading the other accounts here.|It's run by M health Fairview now , BE CAREFUL THE DIRECTORS OF THE HMO AT M HEALTH FAIRVIEW TOLD MY DOCTOR TO LIE TO HIS PATIENTS.. My doctor refused. Be very careful this place is about money and bringing in ""new clients"".. Don't think for one second that they ACTUALLY care about you...  The doctor that I have cares but the HMO ARE A BUNCH OF DIRTY LYING SNAKES!!! Be Wary ....|The entire clinic staff is wonderful. Everyone there is kind & takes the time to make sure you're getting the care you need. I've been going for over 3 years now because they gave me my life back. I can't thank the care team enough or recommend them more. (I see Rachel ,Warnsholz Dr. Anderson & Deb Trost).|I was a patient of Jackie Higgins for several years and I think she was the best. She is a very caring, gentle, intelligent Nurse Practitioner. I wanted to stay under her care at United Pain but due to insurance changes I had to move to another clinic. Thank you Jackie!!|The doctors and practitioners are great! The only drawback is Dr. Ericksons nurse. She gets orders wrong often and even sends scripts to the wrong pharmacies and it's a hassle getting it straightened out. Also I never know if orders for therapies has gone through or not. Sometimes they have and sometimes haven't. She told me if she doesn't call to confirm thst it's been taken care of, but it sometimes hasn't and again it's a mess.|I also experienced almost the exact experience as also reported by another patient who gave a one star rating. She does not even deserve a one star rating. On my second visit my provider was combative, accusational,abusive,  judgemental and a bully. She twisted my comments around to make it sound as if I  was accusing her of saying things. I was fully prepared to sign a patient agreement which I  described as daunting and somewhat intimidating , so she ACCUSED ME of accusing  her of intimidating me. On my first visit she asked me if I  was still taking therapy for alcohol use. I said that I  was never in such a program and suggested her records were wrong. Before my second visit I checked with my primary physician if there was any record of this in my history. There was not! On my second visit I asked my provider about this question which sent her into a tirade of verbal abuse and accused me of accusing her of fabricating information.
I stayed very calm during her barrage of abuse and have never been exposed to such unprofessional behavior by anyone let alone a healthcare professional. After she stopped yelling at me she made up an excuse to leave the office due to an imaginary urgent phone call she had to take and never returned.
I strongly suspect that the lady and I who had a similar experience had the very same provider. Yes  Terry it was that psycho Jackie|Overall, clinic seemed ok, but avoid the practitioner Jackie.  My husband had an awful experience with Jackie.  He saw her for pain management of chronic pain due to arthritis.  She told him NOTHING about the specifics of their actual pain management program, the conditions and expectations to receive care through the program.  And no mention of patient agreement to be signed.   There was some confusion about his urine test so he left clinic without taking it.  She called and told him to come back in, with no further explanation about importance of test.  As a result, because he didn't return to clinic immediately for urine test, he was ""disqualified from the pain program"" (which he didn't even know he was in and obviously hadn't signed any agreement about it) because of a ""failed"" urine test.  Completely unethical and unprofessional.  She also seemed less focused on his current chronic pain issues and his desire to minimize pain meds and more focused on alcohol aftercare (sober 8 years).  When he indicated he's not getting alcohol treatment at this time and also wasn't interested in behavioral therapy, her responses were demeaning, she twisted his words and became combative.  Her professional behavior is reckless, irresponsible and she's a poor communicator.  She definitely has her own agenda and it does not include the health and welfare of the patient.|The staff here is so kind and courteous and my Doctor, Dr Alhatem is absolutely AMAZING!

And he has been a genuine breath of fresh air for someone who sees multiple providers and is very worn down of all the medical speak, without explanation. He did a terrific job explaining my issues in terms that were easily able to be understood. He also drew a lovely Picasso style picture to demonstrate the mechanics of the jaw itself for me. And he even led me to a potential root cause to a good portion of my chronic issues!|I was told by my primary doctor that I should ask my dentist about TMJ.  She referred me to Dr. Herman for an evaluation.  The intake person at the clinic was very thorough in understanding why I was there and what my symptoms were.  After all, I had no pain and was at a pain clinic!  Dr. Herman then did a thorough examination and found the source of the clicking sound I had, educated me on TMJ, examined me by having me move my jaw and open my mouth, had me put in my retainer and evaluated my bite with it in, and explained why I do not have TMJ.

The top medical practitioners all seem to know each other.  Our children's orthodontist had referred me to a prosthodontist to do an implant for our son who had a missing tooth, and she referred me to the dentist who referred me to Dr. Herman at this clinic.  Dr. Herman now has referred me to an ENT to address my primary doctor's diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction. Because of his speciality with TMJ, Dr. Herman works with ENTs.  Because he knew our children's orthodontist and prosthodontist as well as the dentist, I am confident he has referred me to one of the very best ENTs in the Twin Cities. I am also confident I do not have TMJ -- which is progress!|If you want to feel like a really low priority, use this clinic!  All their procedures, orders, appointments take a very long time, so you're for sure out several months on receiving any real treatment.  Also, it is impossible to talk to a human being when you call their ""reception desk""!  You can not hold for a receptionist and they are constantly on the phone so you will be sent to their voicemail.  Eventually your call will be returned several days after you made it, so don't count on any help for anything urgent and if you complain, they will blame you for not following up sooner.

I have contacted the Plymouth office, they offered no assistance!  They told me to leave a message and they'll get back to me...precisely the problem!!!|Very good experience. Doctor was pleasant, very thorough with the exam and answered all my questions. Many treatment options offered, I felt like I was getting the best care plan.|Based on the examination and an assessment of my situation the doctor explained very well  the different apnea treatment options and which would probably work best for me pending the results of a home sleep study. Very patient, thorough and professional. UPDATE as of 1/23/2005: Dr. Thakur has been great but your billing area has been less than helpful. UHC has denied the $2,000 claim for the appliance saying it's not covered under Medicare to which I submitted an appeal. If what they say is true that's something you should have known and told me about up front in which case I wouldn't have even started down this road. If UHC upholds their denial I won't be visiting your office any longer. In the meantime stop sending me automated payment notices until I hear back from UHC. Btw your portal is a black hole. No one in your office ever responds to any of my messages.
Tony Rees|Dr Thakur is first rate! Compassionate and explained things really well. She was also very clear about the best and most cost effective ways for me to access my health and dental benefits. I can't praise her too highly! Also appreciated the communication with clinic as to insurance and appointment details.|Staff friendly and helpful. Dr Herman and his nurses have my best interests in mind.|I recently had a first-time office visit with Dr. Cory Herman. I was impressed with the speed at which I was taken to an exam room- absolutely no wait time whatsoever. A very thorough intake interview was then performed by one of his assistants, and a considerable amount of time was spent reviewing my medical and dental history and reason for visit. Everything was documented in their computer system, and they also had access to my medical records, which very much helped to bridge the information. Dr. Herman then saw me; again there was no wait time between interview and doctor. He spent a lot of time with me, and listened attentively to my story. After dialog and discussion he put forth several options as a treatment plan for my dental issue, and explained the reasoning behind each of them. Under his guidance, he let me select which avenues to pursue first. I felt that there was a strong partnership between doctor and patient, and fully trusted everything that he discussed with me. I look very forward to my continued work with Dr. Herman, as together we pool our efforts to resolve my dental situation.",2024-12-19|2024-12-31|2024-09-25|2024-10-16|2024-09-03|2024-04-18|2024-12-11|2023-12-21,5|5|1|5|2|5|5|5,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|11 a.m.",56|51.4|40.2,"Onsite services, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do you provide telehealth services?","Yes.

He listens and cares and explains things thoroughly.  Highly recommend him.|I have lower back issues, disc L4L5. The pain began June of 2019, I was rear-ended. The pain went down both legs and shots (what feels like a million of them) did nothing every time but one... maybe. For a few years the pain was relentless and I had to just live with it.

I found Dr Adimi, he did a very minor... very low pain (better than before the surgery) surgery. It works!!!  90% of the pain is gone! I can live very well with that, not perfectly back to normal, but much, much better all around. I'm so happy to be active and having fun again, its no longer a burden to do activities with my family and friends.

It gives a nice longer term result too. It should relieve pain for up to 3 years, typically first round is about 1.5 years.

I will take that and worth every cent!

May you always be blessed,

He is able to learn about your health issues and figure out a plan for you to improve or resolve them in a very affordable way.  He teaches you a lot about each issue so you are able to understand what is going on and what the treatment options are.  He allows you to be a partner in the decision making for each health treatment.  Dr. Fors and his staff take very good care of their patients!!|Dr. Fors is fantastic! I have been suffering with the same symptoms for several years and my regular Dr wasn't able to determine why they continued.  While attending a seminar Dr. Fors facilitated, he described each & every symptom I had.  I decided to get some testing done through Pain and Brain Healing Center.  Tests revealed I have an autoimmune disease & behavior & diet changes would greatly help me.  I have implemented several changes & have realized better health.

I will continue to see Dr. Fors to achieve better health.",2023-04-22|2022-11-17|2018-03-10|2021-09-10|2016-07-14|2016-07-14|2020-07-25|2016-07-15,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|pain_management_services|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|good_doctors|friendly_staff|comfortable_waiting_area|thorough_care|multiple_locations|advanced_treatment_options|injection_treatments|on_site_pharmacy,,,,,,,,,,ChIJKySSYLAjs1IR5_leS-PI9sE,22

My condition is very complex, so I prepared a print off of the most important and relevant factors that contribute to my pain, which she totally dismissed. I was looking into a spinal cord stimulator, something supposed to be among her expertise. When it came time to determine if we were to move forward with a spinal cord stimulator, she passed off all responsibility to my previous surgeon who has no expertise in that area. The only thing she did do was the worst possible thing she could do. Without providing something else to reduce my pain, she lowered the quantity of my pain medication, a medication I have been taking as is for over 10 years.  The worst part about everything was she didn't even tell me about it! There was absolutely no discussion of changing my medication during the appointment!!!  I didn't miss anything, my mom Is a nurse and was there with me. I found out Dr Kihtir had reduced my pain medication when I picked up my prescription and realized the quantity was less than it was supposed to be. I also found out she planned to reduce my prescription by the same amount every month.  I asked if Dr Kihtir could give me a call or a message to explain what she was thinking and she refused to return my phone call! She is the absolute worst pain doctor I have ever met!!! I would avoid both Dr Kihtir and the United Pain Center at all cost!|Dr. Kihtir it is time to retire. You treated me like a bother in your life. While reading my chart you rolled your eyes and gave a little giggle followed by OMG. When l asked if there was something funny about my 8 back surgeries you said, come on, you didn't need all that medicine. Apparently you forgot l didn't write the prescriptions l was under a doctor's care. One day she asked me if l knew how bad l looked. The nurse who put me in a room asked me what l did to make her hate me. During a back injection she told me to turn my head the other way, l asked why since l am deaf in one ear. She said the conversation between her and the nurse was none of my business. The nurses were on strike and this one was asking about art fairs. I brought up one they didn't know about. That nurse saw me crying and mouthed, l'm so sorry. I can say l was actually afraid of her, of asking questions. I called on the day of my appointment and said l will not be in today and l'm not coming back to United Pain. No one contacted me to ask why.I should have reported her but the staff told me if l did she would have me dismissed. I would break out in hives waiting to see her. I'm sure she was thrilled when l left. I know l was.|Dr. Kihtir is one of the best doctors I've had. I went to a few other doctors for pain. Most treated me like a junkie searching for a fix instead of actually listening to me and understanding what I am going through. I started with Dr. Kihtir about 5 years ago. At first I was worried she would be like all the other doctors I previously saw and just tell me I'm too young to have chronic pain despite the 20+ surgeries I've had. Dr. Kihtir was different. She listened, then asked questions! She tried multiple treatments for my pain and truly seems to care. I hope she never quits practicing because she is truly the best doctor I've ever had, by a landslide!|Dr Kithir goes out of her way to help my pain condition. Yes, she's tough, but she's very good. I've never seen her mad, upset, storm out of the room, or lose her patience. If you show trust and honesty with her, she gives it back! I don't know where I'd be without her pain management knowledge. I don't think most people know how hard the State & Government come down on Pain Mgment Physicians.|I have never been made to feel as horrible as she made me feel.  I realize there are people who abuse their prescriptions.  I also understand that it must be hard to do a job like hers, but if you hate it so bad than please for those of us that are not drug seekers, and do not abuse our prescription QUIT.  Its not fair to the non-abusers.  In the time I have been a patient of United pain center I have never had a provider 1.  Yell at me. 2.  Call me a liar.  3.  Storm out of the room. 4.  Refuse to listen to me. 5.  Refer to me as ""sweetheart"" sarcasticly .Thank God in heaven I recorded this appointment!!|Terrible bedside manner. Doesn't have the patient's best interest in mind.

There were several back-and-forth calls as she worked with Katrina Gabelko (the best in the business!) to find an acceptable and doable solution, made ever more difficult by the fact that I sustained a TBI in 2011, and my cognitive processing has been compromised.

Collection called and agreed! it was a scam but said it would cost more to go to court. Other Lake walk providers I have used are top notch but this guy is ""dreck""./|Dr. Chris Davis and his staff are incredible. They make the whole experience comfortable from start to finish. I understood everything that was going on and why. I would highly recommend|My name is David  Greene and I don't write many of these reviews. I feel that it is time to write one to do what I can to help others with knowing what they can expect from the pain management clinic here in Duluth Minnesota. I have never had an actual office visit with this doctor to discuss my pain.  It's always been a quick hello "" This is what we are injecting into you today"", and that is it.  Never have we talked about where I've been in life and what I've gone through to be in the pain I'm in.  We've never talked about the actual management of my pain and if the procedures are even working, it is not personal at all   They know I've been let down, after a couple years of being called every 4 months for appointments it's now crickets.  The people at Lake walk surgery center are very nice, but the pain management isn't that effective.   To me pain management is more than drugs to alleviate pain, to me its developing a plan to manage it long term (hence the term management).   My primary care physician is levels above the pain management clinic in both treatment and personal care. It's the trust care and compassion of my primary dr that has helped me to find sobriety,  which is 3 years and something I am beyond grateful for.  My primary asks me how he can help me, and has taken the time to understand my story and how I got to where I'm at today.  Life is more than the almighty dollar,  and maximizing how many patients can be seen in a day.   The pain management team people are nice, the lady that used to call me for appointments seemed to be the most caring of all of them.  If the entire team could show as much care and compassion as her, I'd give the place 5 stars.  It's hard to put your trust into a medical facility that has never taken the time to understand the problems and how they came to be.  If I had life to do over,  I'd show them how to take things to the next level.  For now I will walk in pain, and search for the place that will take the time to understand my issues which are as follows.  I've been in four severe car accidents,  two that were roll overs that both warranted life flight.  I've been hit by a car as a pedestrian,  and have sustained two TBI's.  I've fallen off of two roofs as well as 3 levels of scaffolding.  I've broken multiple bones and had several soft tissue tears.  Somedays I hurt so bad that I struggle to sleep let alone get out of the house to do much of everything.  Although they are not all pain related, I have been on the table around 90 times in life now for surgeries/procedures. I've had 5 knee surgeries, three shoulder surgeries, and a couple of back surgeries  Some of which cause me a great level of anxiety and stress which is another thing I don't think this facility is built to deal with.   My pain has been so bad at points in my life that I turned to drinking to numb it, and that caused me to be labeled as a bad person and a drug seeker.  The people at the pain clinic in Duluth are nice people, I just wish they would have taken the time to understand my situation so they could have maximized the level of care they are capable of giving. My last visit for injections was one of the worst procedures I've been through. I was conscious for most of it and experienced the pain when they were injecting me. I wish them all the best but will not call them for another appointment,  I'm currently under the sole care of my primary while I search for another pain management facility in the state to help me find a higher quality of life which we all deserve.  If the facility would like to try to help resolve these issues,  they can call me ( I wont be holding my breath or expecting it) to set up an office visit to discuss my physical pain and how they can help me manage it.  In closure, I want to say again that the people associated with the pain management clinic are nice people, it's just to bad that the management part itself is lacking the management.|Chris and his staff were professional, kind, and attentive to me during my visit. Very prompt as well. Highly recommended.|I am very pleased with how Dr. Davies has helped me deal with the pains I experience from a vehicle accident a few years prior . His treatment has helped me more than any other type of therapy I have received since my accident ,where I had a bus pull out in front of my pickup and the result was not pretty . I just wish I would have came to see him sooner . He is a very down to earth honest physician who displays strong confidence in his work.

I wish I had started QC treatments before the hip pain became debilitating, but I was skeptical. After only 5 months I am no longer limping, and can expect another 15 months of healing! The staff is incredible, the injections are less painful than cortisone (I've had many) and the results are real. If you are in the fence-- don't be. I am so grateful I decided to try QC Kinetics!|During my consult with this clinic for a stem cell procedure, I found some questionable practices and lack of important questions present that ultimately kept me from using their services. First, I never spoke to a doctor, just a salesperson who assured me that they could 'fix' me, despite not even having looked at my MRI (I had it with me). The salesperson literally had no idea what was wrong with me, but I was the perfect candidate for the procedure. Second, at no point was it asked if I had recently had a steroid injection or taken an oral steroid. The salesman actually wanted me to start the process that day and didn't ask if I had recently had a steroid injection, which I had, and nearly all regenerative medicine doctors agree that stem cells should not be administered for many weeks after a steroid is introduced to the body. Lastly, the 'physical' they give you prior to approving you for the procedure is merely palpating that doesn't seem relevant to if you can handle a bone marrow extraction and injections. During this portion, I was told that my psoas was being palpated while I was in a standing position- which I've never seen done in practice due to inaccuracy.

In the end, I truly hope that this clinic is helping people and all these reviews are genuine. The pricing for PRP and stem cells was reasonable, and the few people I encountered were pleasant.|Treatment was very effective with no down time.  Golfing and pickle ball were no problem.  Confidence in my right knee being solid without pain has greatly increased.|QC Kinetix has been an absolute life changer for me! I had excruciating pain in my back/leg for months and then I found out I had a herniated disc in my lower back and was told that surgery was my only option. My husband had heard about QC Kinetix on the radio and said we should give them a try, and I'm so thankful we did! After my second treatment the pain was COMPLETELY gone! I am able to do my everyday activities again and keep up with my kids. My mood has improved and I am feeling SO GOOD again!
I am going to the Maple Grove location and when you walk in the door Krystal at the front desk makes you feel so welcome. Her upbeat attitude is amazing!

Guess I listen to the right radio shows The difference has been unbelievable even after just 3 treatments it has made an epic improvement for my husbands pain levels! I am so praying for continued progress for him!
The most welcoming understanding staff, nurses, dr.s....ya'll really make a difference in peoples lives, I just want you to know that!
My husband cannot believe the relief he has gotten from this!  He may not be 100 percent healed, but the ability to tolerate the amount of pain he was in then till now is amazing.Thank you so much!
It makes a difference for the spouse too, believe it or not|I went into the clinic on April 25th and wasn't sure if I would be a good candidate for their services. After the initial consultation with Randy, I was informed that there is a very good chance this procedure would help me. I am bone on bone left knee with a bum right knee as well and two shoulders screaming at me every day. The pain in my left knee daily, made me sick to my stomach often. I am happy to report that I decided to treat all four areas of my body and the results are absolutely AMAZING!

I've been to many pain clinics and I have to say he is the best I've seen and I would recommend him to everyone ..he's great.|From the 1st phone call the staff and Dr Morales were fantastic. They were able to get me in the same day. He was able to relieve my pain and make my quality of life better, which is something that another pain clinic, my primary and even my orthopedic specialist couldn't do. They listen to you and work with you, they don't just cram medications down your throat and send you on your way. I will and have refer anyone and everyone I know to Dr Morales.|Dr Morales is a very personable doctor. I have found that previous doctors I've visited have not listened to what I was actually saying, but just bouncing me from medication to medication. And get this: He will actually CALL you on the phone!(something the doctors at my previous clinic would never do.   I am very comfortable and confident seeing Dr Morales, even at the expense of a 3 hour drive!|I have been going to the clinic for about 3 years.

Dr. Haas has done many procedures and all of them have helped immensely. Suzanna, a nurse there, is my angel. She is one of the only nurses that can get the i.v. needles.in on the first time.  She has the best humor and I love it when she is there. Another staff I think very highly of is Ken, an anesthesiologist, because he is so kind and gentle. I feel very safe when he is working on me. Unfortunately, when I got home from my last surgery I had a long review written up on some scrap paper that I was going to type as my review but when I was in the hospital and rehab  for my back, my husband started cleaning up and threw it out. I had spent a lot of time on the review.that I was going to type in for the review.  Unfortunately I ended up falling 6 times and ended up in the hospital and then a rehab facility for my back. I am going to need surgery which will happen as soon as things can get arranged. I appreciate all the things the Twin Cities Pain Clinic have done for me to keep me from having surgery this long.|Had my first epidural steroid injection yesterday, I had a TON of anxiety prior to my appointment. The staff was phenomenal! They did everything in their power to make sure I was comfortable and my needs were met. During the procedure Dr. Haas and staff were diligent, I was thoroughly impressed with their practices and kindness. Everyone was on the same page before they started the procedure, talking out loud making sure I also knew what was going on. I was also concerned about a potential allergy to corticosteroids, they had me pre-medicate with Benadryl and started with a half dose to be safe then monitored me in the recovery room for 10-15 minutes. This was the best experience I could ask for. Thank you so much for your professionalism and authentic care.|I've been here 3 times. LOVE the staff. Dr Haas, Kim (nurse) and the anesthesiologist (the man with black glasses) are all phenomenal. They're kind, fun even.
I experienced a massive headache and they didn't let me sit in pain, and to me, that's really important.
Dr Haas is really nice & compassionate. Kim was great, even when I got sick momentarily from meds, and even going as far as waking my son up out in my truck when he didnt answer his phone.
The anesthesiologist didn't mind my jokes. All in all, GREAT experiences with them. I wouldn't go anywhere else. VERY clean facility, VERY good care, VERY good staff. TCSC & TCPC has the BEST providers I've ever seen!  So grateful.
They're hard to get ahold of though for post problems. BUT, I understand They're busy and don't expect them to drop everything at once.
 Thank you Dr Haas, Kim & Mr anesthesiologist.
Sincerely, Michelle G.|I have been to the surgery center for 2 injections cervical and lumbar. The surgery center is a very clean facility and the staff are all very kind and respectfull. Doctor Sherri Haas is very competent and proffesional.  Twin Cities Surgery Center is one of the best pain management surgical facilities I have
been to for injections. Highly trained staff overall my experience was very good. I give them an exellent rating.|I've been to this surgery center quite a few times for injections. The injections haven't worked but Dr. Hass was amazing. She talked me through the whole procedure each time!
I'm trying to set up an appointment for a nerve stimulator trial and no one is answering the phone or returning my messages. I'm not sure what's going on but I've left two messages and called 4 times in the last two weeks. I'm going to call the Practice Administrator tomorrow.
Edit: The Practice Administrator texted me the next morning and apologized. Someone called a couple of minutes later and I set up my trial appointment. I'm going to  give them 5 stars because they were quick to resolve my issues.
8/24/2023 Edit.
For a while there were people answering the phones. Not anymore. They said before, that my phone calls never registered in their system. I'm guessing that because I now have to leave messages that most of my calls aren't going through even though I get their phone recordings when I leave a message. I don't understand. I'm just going to have to find another provider.|Great place for different types of surgeries to alleviate chronic pain. The staff is extremely friendly and will do whatever they can to make you feel comfortable. They treat all patients with respect and can clearly see they truly care about their patients. Depending on the surgery they want to make sure the patients are fully taken care of the minute they leave the building. This place gives people hope and a chance to feel somewhat normal when they are dealing with not normal circumstances during their daily life.|The staff is fabulous- caring, attentive, friendly, quick in a good way, and the nurses have humor. I like that Dr. Anne talks to you during procedures (helps to calm and is much appreciated)- thank you Dr. Anne. Wish all places were like this- they should be the standard for the medical field and recognized by the state/peers/patients/etc.- seriously, I worked in the medical field before getting sick and seen it all, now on the other end, I find it's difficult to find providers who genuinely care for patients for the long haul and TCSC/TCPC go above and beyond and are consistent. Melissa in billing is awesome- she should be in charge of the billing at the surgery center (ran into issues with previous billing staff over a year ago, glad to see it's changed for the better). Unconditionally recommend!|Terrible customer service! Several attempts to contact scheduling for a procedure to be done. Told lies from the supervisor. Trying to tell me facts about my case and what's going on. Not cool. Over 1 hour and 25 minutes of waiting on the phone to be hung up on more than two times to get zero voicemails and no callbacks after waiting in queue. I do not recommend this place.

The staff and nurses were great and understanding I'm really glad I found Advance Pain Management when I moved up here.|Personally, I felt compelled to change my review. My first experience was positive, but the next one was not.  I had an allergic reaction to one of the injections and no one would call me back. So I never went back.
Then, I had a new injury in 2023. It was a nightmare. I saw so many doctors and they all treated me like I was a drug-seeking addict!. Really?? Walk a mile in my shoes and tell me, you do not need any type of medication to manage your pain. The joke was on them as I could not even have the stuff they were accusing me of wanting.
The injections did not help and unless I wanted more injections I was told there was nothing else they could do to help me.
I've had a lot of bad care at Mankato clinic over the years, but this one took the cake.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy if I had one.
The doctors need more pain training and Mankato clinic needs to recheck their policies for how they treat people who come in for pain issues. We want to feel better. If it takes a pill to do that, then give us a pill. I was told injections can do more damage. so why push injections??? That's right because they cost thousands of dollars were as they do not make much on pills.
Shame on you Mankato Clinic.
On the plus side though, the staff on the procedure side were absolutely amazing. And the reception was also amazing.
If you are in pain, go to Mayo or to one of the pain clinics in the cities.  You will be treated better.|Dr. Michael is very knowledgeable when it comes to how the mechanics of the bones, muscles and tendons all work together. He is also very kind, friendly and listens well. He explains thoroughly, and shows me, what's going on with me and what treatments he recommends that may work. I recommend him to find the source of your pain like he did mine and help you find relief for it.|I like the providers and the nurses. They treat people well and are very helpful.
I am updating my review to express my gratitude for the care I receive from APM.
(Now owned by Mankato Clinic)
My provider gently encouraged me to consider a treatment that I was pretty skeptical about (fearful) but eventually I decided to take the steps to try it, and I am so grateful that I did!!
I believe that the providers care for their patients, and if you have a chronic pain issue, please don't suffer forever.
This is a wonderful clinic with caring staff.|Had a procedure done here in July 2020, 3 weeks post-surgery upper right extremity by orthopedic general surgeon, as I was continuing to have intense pain that was excruciating.   I was referred here for a nerve block procedure to help decrease the pain. I never had an initial assessment with Dr. Ifechi, simply made a call for the procedure over the phone with staff. That nerve block was somewhat helpful with my pain, however, I ended up in ER several hours after I had gotten home from Advanced Pain Mngt due to serious side effects that affected my breathing & very serious, which they should have known about my lung disease from the Ortho Surgeon referral. It was recommended I go back for a second procedure, but I opted out. I received a bill for this, which was a considerable amount, but Medicare Part B paid the majority of the bill. I was reviewing my Medicare claims that were submitted & processed one day & glad I did. Advanced Pain Mngt submitted a medical claim to Medicare for an evaluation & diagnosis on a date in July 2020 post-surgery & prior to my scheduled date of the 24th. I never had an evaluation there & knew nothing about a diagnosis involved.  The claim submitted for the actual nerve block procedure  was accurate, but rather spendy. This procedure & billing fraud took place prior to Mankato Clinic taking Advanced Pain Mngt under their umbrella. I did contact Advanced Pain Mngt after they became a part of Mankato Clinic, yet billing statements from previously owned facility were not available & Mankato Clinic could not answer. I did find it interesting when I called Advanced Pain Mngt asking a nurse about this over billing & what this diagnosis meant that Dr. Ifechi found during an evaluation I wasn't even involved in.  She informed me that he generally does submit claims to Medicare with Medicare Advantage plans with a ""CRPS"" diagnosis CMS Code so insurance will pay. This CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) was never mentioned by Dr. Ifechi or by the referring Ortho Surgeon. I will not return even though they have a different Billing Dept now. Unethical business practices & an unnecessary nerve block procedure for a fictitious diagnosis. I highly comnend the staff especially the wonderful caring nurses. I have been seen at a different pain management facility & they take the time to care, they offer options for pain mngt & present the best solutions for each individual with an accurate diagnosis. Advanced Pain Mngt is a ""one-size fits all"" approach & that is clearly not in the best interest of any patient dealing with severe &/or chronic pain conditions. Ask many questions & get the answers you need. Peace of mind is a wonderful feeling.|Bad Bad Bad.......

Like all the other negative reviews on here, my experience is pretty much the same. Dr. Ifeci Anyadioha does not care about you or even attempt to get personal with you or try to get to know you or your problems. He just does a quick glance at the files and says what HE wants to do. And of course he wants to go right into steroid injections because they cost $3,000+ each, this place is all about money and that's it. There's really no genuine empathy or show of concern towards the patient. It's a total joke.
I've had numerous shots and tests so far, still in the same pain as when I first went there.

As far as the nurses go, they are pretty great, I do like them. That's about the only positive thing I can comment on this horrid place.

Wish I would've gone to the Mayo clinic in Rochester for my back care.

Please consider other options before this place. This place should be a very last resort if needed.|The staff is very nice & professional. The new doctor is nice but very rough during procedures even with anesthesia. Never had that problem with Dr. Metta. I have been going here for years & it used to help, but it seems I'm worse now. I'm going to have to find other options. I will miss the doctors & nurses, because they are all so nice, but I need to find a solution.|I was a patient at the Mankato , MN facility.  Dr. Ifichi is very good at what he does.  He explains things well and performs the epidurals with care and accuracy.  The reason I am giving Advanced Pain Management a 1 star rating is because of their billing department.  They continued to mishandle insurance claims and are very hard to reach to get things fixed.  As a result I had one very large mishandled claim go into collections. My credit rating is in the mid 800's, so it is not like we do not take bill paying serious.  For this reason I will look for another provider and suggest you do also.",2023-10-04|2019-08-29|2023-04-08|2019-01-04|2022-01-09|2016-11-21|2017-09-20|2020-12-16,5|1|5|5|1|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Appointments recommended","Do you take Medicare?","Yes, they take Medicare, Medicaid.

Immediately when she entered the room, without sitting down or introducing herself, she said ""No more opioids! You will never be getting oxycodone here again!"" I was given 18 tabs and told to take them every day for my pain because I do treatment everyday that is very painful and would send me to the ER without my oxycodone. She claimed that I was supposed to be taking the tablets they were giving me 1x a week. Which would mean they wanted to give me enough pills in 1 month to last me over a 6 month time frame?? Um no. It didn't make sense. She was yelling at us and getting out of her chair and then sitting down so my partner had to pull out his camera to record in case she became more violent. She was getting in my face and yelling at me while talking down to my partner. She also referenced a packet during my appt. that showed dates of appointments that were not mine. When my partner went back in to try to get the papers (because that's our right) after the appt., they acted super weird about it and said they couldn't prove that the notes she was looking at were actually from my chart and not another patients. My partner and I left scared and confused as she kept saying basically that she would blacklist me now. We never got to speak an entire sentence the entire appointment, she interrupted everything we said. So then when she said they don't offer oxycodone to patients that don't have cancer (even though my friends and family members have gotten it from that clinic!!) we asked what other options I had. She said there were no other options for me. Then what the hell does the spine and pain clinic do for patients who don't have cancer?? She literally would not answer and kept saying how I wouldn't be getting opioids. And we repeatedly kept saying that we understood that but wanted to know what other options there were. Then she randomly starts talking about LDN and prescribes it to me? And at the end she says ""Oh yeah and I'm on LDN too."" She never said goodbye or anything. She got up from her chair with her papers and just started walking out of the room. When I told her she was being unprofessional, she said ""You're saying that because I'm not giving you oxycodone"" To which I replied, ""No we're saying that because you haven't answered a single question we've had or let us finish a single question we've needed answered"" She also said I refused a drug test which wasn't true and I wasn't sure why she was then asking for a drug test if I wasn't getting oxycodone... I just left crying and so confused as to how someone could treat a human being that way and stand over me and my partner and yell at us for asking questions and trying to talk. She seemed very unstable.|I suffer from 2 hurniated discs and arthritis in my back.  I have been getting steroid injections in my back with Dr. Adimi for over a year.  The last injections I got, I noticed they were no longer working like they had before.  I had to go into the clinic and look for next steps/options.  I was assigned to the NP Meral Atay.  I arrived at my appointment balling in excruciating pain.  Something was severely wrong and I couldn't manage the pain.  I was in a wheel chair and could barely walk.  I have never been prescribed opioids with Dr. Adimi.  This appointment was very different.  I have never been in so much pain in my life.  When I saw Meral Atay she was absolutely awful.  She was incredibly insensitive to my back pain and offered me a steroid pill to stop the pain.  The only next option she gave me was to get something implanted in my back to TRY and see if it would work.  When I questioned this procedure Meral said there was ""nothing more they can do for me"" and WALKED OUT OF MY APPOINTMENT!  My blood pressure at the time of the appointment was 185/99, I don't have a history of high blood pressure, this was clearly a reaction to the pain I was in.  This nurse literally walked out of the office, offering me NOTHING for pain relief and left me there balling my eyes out.  She walked out of the office and then called SECURITY when I asked to see Dr. Adimi.  I never received a call back from anyone.  I limped out of the office balling with a sky high blood pressure.  The absolute WORST experience I have EVER had in a clinic.  They advertise as a ""Pain Clinic"" but only push injections on you and refuse you any acute pain relief.  They are NOT a pain clinic.  Dr. Adimi knew about this and never even bothered to call me back.  I would never recommend this clinic to anyone.  I believe Meral Atay is the worst nurse I have ever met and I will never enter that clinic again.|I have been suffering with Trochanteric Bursitis which caused severe burning and muscle pain in both hips and legs.  I was referred to Pain Clinic by Ortho.  The first two visits were with Angie PA.  At both visits she recommended that I continue with scheduled Gabapentin and Tramadol and discontinue medical cannabis.

When I realized I needed a refill on Tramadol I called the clinic.  They told me that a visit is required to get a refill.  Angie was booked for the week so I had to see a different PA for virtual visit.  She asked me why I had discontinued medical cannabis and was not aware of my diagnosis of chronic bursitis.  She then told me that I would need to sign pain contract and have UA done for Tramadol to be prescribed.  I was very confused as this was not explained at all by Angie at first two visits.  As another reviewer stated, I felt that I was fighting with the clinic.  They did not give me all of the information and then when I am confused and frustrated they treated me like it was my fault.  The PA told me she would speak to Angie about this and call me back that day.  I never heard back from her.  I am looking to switch pain clinics as I don't like the way I have been treated and don't feel it builds a trusting patient/doctor relationship.|I've been suffering from chronic Lyme disease and pain is inseparable part of my life. The pain reaches its highest in the late afternoon and evening, but with help of Percocet I've been able to function without going insane from pain. The first time I saw Dr.Ademi, he told me that he would start cutting off my medication and then would take me off. Without fully learning about my case (I believe he knows nothing about Lyme), he rushed to apply the same strategy on me that he uses for his back pain patients.
He told me to schedule an appointment in 4 weeks, but wrote a prescription for two weeks only. When I called the clinic to request the refill, they told me that they don't do refills over the phone.
From that time and on, I was in a constant confrontation with the clinic. Instead of being on my side to help me to fight this horrific disease that it is, the doctor instead made me to go through a horrific stress, denying me a medication. Instead of fighting the disease I had to use all my very limited energy to fight the clinic.
When they have finally told me that they are sending the prescription to my pharmacy, I went there only to find out that I didn't have a medication on my name. I called the clinic and left a message, but nobody called me back that day. And then there was a weekend and Christmas.
Without any medication to address the pain, I sunk into a deep depression. It was the most miserable Christmas I ever had.
The amount of stress this clinic caused me is so  great that I am leaving not only this clinic, but all other doctors that I used to see in the same building. Even a thought of being near Spine & Pain Center makes me anxious.|I love Dr. Adimi he is very kind and knowledgeable. Remembers information about his patients that I know isn't in the chart. He is awesome at injections. I get lumbar sympathetic injections. I followed him from another facility because he was good at injections.
I was able to get to know him as a physician better at Ridgeview. The other facility only allowed me to see nurse practitioners at office visits so follow ups were never by the physician. Dr Adimi does his  own follow ups at his office, which I appreciate and givs patient and doctor opportunities to understand what is going on. He is good at explaining things i recently had an MRI and he made sure I understood even though i have a medical background.
I drive 2 hours to see him and it is well worth the trip. Wish I didn't have to have a driver for the injection but that is not his rule its the surgery center even without sedation. If you are looking for a caring GOOD pain doctor look no more.|My first review would be something great 5+ stars. That is when I was being seen by Dr. Ademi.
Now I don't have same opinion.
Not treated as a individual nor feel like I'm being listened to nor do I feel all people directly involved in my care read the important part of my reason for being treated at a pain clinic. When you are treated by someone like Dr. Ademi and someone else comes around who treats you Less as a individual, or importance, listens and treats you the way they feel not what's best as a whole person.
It's hard not to be affected by this change.
No same day call backs ect...
I truly miss being directly treated by Dr. Ademi.
I felt like I was truly cared for.
I will however try to keep a open mind to someone new and hopefully that person will be open to what I'm saying not what I already know and already do to fight my every day pain. And most of all listen and hear me.
Recieve knowledge as to why my pain and other symptoms are more intensified.
So Dr.Ademi is great this is why I chose to change my first review. He's awesome.|The best in the field of many Pain Management doctors I've seen so far. But my pain is still not manageable in places, but not because of Dr. Adimi and the very capable staff. I appreciate the opportunity to see Dr. Adimi for other problems I'm experiencing.

Dropped me cold turkey.  Owes me money and won't pay. Very unprofessional.  Not sure what happened to her why she turned that way. But send me my money or I'm getting a lawyer|Worst place ever... I have insurance but she will not bill them. Instead she charges me $200 cash and does not give you a receipt. At my last appointment she took my $200 and when I tried to explain my co pay wad only $45 she got mad and told me she was not responsible for billing my insurance and threatened to can the police if I did not leave.

She has been an absolute staple in her communities. She takes the time to listen to people and she serves such an overlooked and under severed demographic of patients the health care system has over looked or failed. She has walked away from facilities that treated patients like numbers and not people and opened her own practice hoping to make a change in the metro area. She is a beautiful mentor , mother and woman we need more people like her. I read some of her reviews ... because I know she is to classy to address those but Providers have the right to charge a fee for certification she has always been transparent in pricing this service is not covered by insurance as a patient/customer it's always our choice and right to find something else.

Very thorough with his work and practice. Always takes the time to hear my concerns with zero pressure about the time he spends with me. This is a doctor that makes me feel seen and heard. I see Dr Banik for pain management & although I'm one of those unusual not fixable chronic pain cases, we have found solutions, so that I can at least tolerate standing and walking. For reference I was becoming completely immobile before I started knee ablation procedures. Through every procedure he always lifts me up with encouraging words and laughter. I feel very taken care of by Dr Banik and would recommend him in a heart beat. He's a doctor who cares. We've worked together I believe 4 years now and I plan on maintaining him as my doctor for as long as he's here|I've had two successful epidurals for back and leg problems from Dr. Banik. He spent a generous amount of time ahead of both appointments listening to my descriptions of longtime post-injury issues and targeted the injections exactly. I highly recommend Dr. Banik and his team.|Dr. Banik and his nurse Anna are fantastic!
I receive trigger point injections from Dr. Banik.
This is because I had neck surgery in 2009 and five days later(2010) I had staphylococcus.
My neck surgeon removed all the infected material and by God's will  I healed.  Now, I live with severe pain because the musculoskeletal tissues are permanently damaged.
Dr. Banik gives my injections precisely where I need them for maximum benefit.  He stops and asks where I need more injections to thoroughly cover my pain. He prescribes a pain medication that I am Extremely careful with.
I am also a transplant patient  at the University of MN. Dr.Banik works well with my team.

Dr. Banik has never been late to one of my appointments. He has been kind and thorough with my care. He is aware of my medical history and  takes it all into consideration when treating me. I would and have  recommended Dr. Banik to friends and family.|Dr. Banik was more than an hour late for the appointment. Then he rushed in and asked about my asthma. I don't have asthma. Then he asked about my COPD. I don't have COPD. I have osteoarthritis in my back and several joints from an accident 60 years earlier. Once he pulled up my chart, he explained that I have problems with my back. Gosh; thanks for the news.

His ""After the visit"" notes were inaccurate as well. I'll never go back.|Dr Banik and his nurse Anna have been critical in me regaining a quality of life. When I first met them I was in a wheelchair in horrendous pain 24 hours a day. 3 years of pain management with them later, I am able to walk, clean my house, enjoy family outings, take care of my kids and grandkids and thoroughly enjoy life 100% more. I owe all of this to them and am so grateful every day!|I was Prescribed a Tens Unit after a Nerve Block done by Dr Banik. It took Months and multipule calls to have his office call the medical supplier and have them send the Prescribed unit to my home. I have made several calls for Tens Unit Leads so you can use this system after having an Apt January 26th with DR Banik. Today is February 14th and I have left VMs made several attempts to obtain the leads for this unit so I can walk! After speaking to 4 different people today I find out there is not a prescription for Tens Unit Leads!? I don't understand what it's going to take to get someone to do there job at this Location I have the call logs proving I have called prior to today! Update 8-31-2023 Dr Banik spoke to me and we figured out there was a communication error. My issue has since been handled by Dr banik. Please speak to this office if your having issues the nurses and Dr will help! Thank you Dr. Banik|Dr. Banking is fantastic.  He listens patiently and he is very kind.|If it were possible I would give him 0 stars. Dr.Banik is a horrible pain doctor. I been going to him on and off for over a year. What has he done to ""help""? He told me to ignore my pain that I'm making it a bigger deal than it really is basically saying it was mostly in my head. He told me to get a boyfriend, get a job, and watch some exercise videos of things I can't physically do. He kept making comments about me being on pain meds and that I'm too young. He then kept insisting there's nothing he can do but ""guide"" me. Every time i saw him i would be waiting for a long time in the room just for him to invalidate me ,make me feel horrible for being on meds insisting i didn't need them, making me feel so depressed I wanted to cry, and he would leave as quickly as he could. I sat in a room waiting for him he comes in tells me there's nothing he can do within less than 15 minutes he was leaving having done absolutely nothing which is what he did for pretty much every visit. he didn't help at all  i have been to multiple pain clinics and he did even less than MAPS clinic did. At least they tried some things while banik did nothing",2025-01-22|2024-11-29|2022-08-30|2022-08-17|2020-08-28|2023-02-14|2024-12-01|2020-02-26,5|5|5|1|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJb9xoYx0ts1IRjKVfUFtU5sA,9

She is an absolutely amazing medical professional. I initially came to her for post-stem cell treatments, HA, and PRP, and since then, I've relied on her for trigger point injections, SI joint injections, shockwave therapy, and more--basically, I go here for everything now! I literally went from barely being able to walk because my back was so messed up to 95% in 48 hours.

What sets Cynthia apart is not just her expertise but her genuine care for her patients. She has done so much to help me get back on my feet when I could barely move, and her preventative approach ensures I don't get to that point again. I also love that she offers in-house and mobile IV services, making treatment even more accessible. Plus, she provides referrals when needed, ensuring I always get the best possible care.

I'm on their subscription plan for prescriptions and see Cynthia at least once a month. The level of service is top-notch--professional, compassionate, and incredibly versatile in the treatments they offer. If you're looking for someone who truly cares about your health and well-being, Cynthia and Moderni Spine are the best in the business! Highly recommend!|Cynthia at Moderni Spine is my go-to for joint and back care. She has helped me manage pain and mobility with a crazy array of different treatments, keeping me feeling my best. On top of that, her in-house and mobile IV services are a game-changer for recovery and overall wellness.  We get them to come to our house when sickness is running through and they definitely help get us back on our feet.

Whether it's targeted joint care, back treatments, or IV therapy, Cynthia provides professional, effective, and convenient care. Really great service.  My wife and I are very happy that we found someone so good.|I was going through the most painful and disruptive health issue of my life.  I had been to 8 different doctors  in a month  including 2 orthopedic doctors and a neurosurgeon and I was back to ground zero (constant intense pain, not sleeping at all,  and no treatment plan other than ""lets wait and see how you feel in a month"") but I wasn't going to make it a month.  I found Moderni Spine (Cynthia Konrath) either by dumb luck or divine intervention    by calling spine care places that were listed on my insurance network website.

I left a message and Cynthia called back.  In a ten minute phone call, I could tell that I had found someone special.  I told my friends and family that I think I had found someone that could help and that I was going to see her tomorrow and that I had actually already talked to the person that I was going to see (unheard of in healthcare as I knew it).  Cynthia cleared time for me at 9:00 the next morning and with some emails and record transfers she was more informed  about my situation by the next morning than the previous 8 doctors combined.

From that point on I received better  healthcare than I would have thought possible for an ordinary person.  Cynthia helped me keep the pain under control,  she was easily accessible for questions and assurance that I was moving in the right direction,  she guided me through various treatments,  and she eventually set me up with an amazing surgeon.  I'm now pain free, drug free and I have no physical restrictions.

I'm so thankful that I found Moderni Spine and Cynthia Konrath.  She has a unique business model and she is so good at what she does.  It's hard to put into words how different this place is but if I have any friends or family that need orthopedic care, they won't need to look around.  They'll be going to Moderni  Spine.|Dr, Cynthia Konrath is an angel in the space of pain management and A treasure to the medical community and the people of Minnesota.   Highly intelligent and open to learning she brings a collaborative and comprehensive treatment to the space of pain management.  Leaving no stone unturned and looking for the stones she hasn't turned over you can trust that she will take good care of you using traditional , ""alternative"", and cutting edge regenerative medicine.  Well networked within the Twin Cities every treatment is available for your care.  I would get an appointment with her now before she's booked up.|From the moment I walked through the doors of Moderni Spine, I was welcomed with warmth and professionalism. Cynthia Konrath, PA, made me feel not only comfortable but also hopeful about finding relief for my chronic neck and back pain. Her extensive expertise in pain management became evident during my very first visit.

I was introduced to shockwave therapy, a cutting-edge treatment that delivered noticeable relief after just one session. What truly sets Moderni Spine apart is the personalized approach to care. Each treatment is meticulously adjusted to ensure optimal results, addressing my specific pain and discomfort.

The clinic itself is exceptional--one of the cleanest and most well-maintained facilities I have ever visited. The environment is not only welcoming but also conducive to healing, reflecting the high standards that Moderni Spine upholds in every aspect of patient care.

An added benefit of choosing Moderni Spine is their collaboration with Integrative Massage, which is conveniently located within the clinic. This service has been an invaluable addition to my treatment plan, significantly accelerating my recovery process.

Cynthia's network extends beyond the clinic as well. She has referred me to several reputable wellness providers, all of whom have contributed to my overall health and wellness goals. Her ability to connect patients with the right resources is just another testament to her dedication and expertise.

I highly recommend Moderni Spine for anyone seeking expert care for pain management. Cynthia Konrath's clinical experience and commitment to patient-centered care make this clinic a standout choice for those in need of comprehensive pain relief.|Cynthia spent time listening to my concerns, significantly more than my regular doctor. She had a variety of treatment options for my pain and discussed the pros and cons of each.|Cynthia Konrath, PA with Moderni Spine has been incredible sharing her clinical knowledge and wisdom to guide me through a perplexing set is issues with my lower lumbar back pain!  She has been patient in answering my many questions in an effort to understand my challenging back pain situation. She is also well networked and was able to refer me to the appropriate spine surgeon who provided an excellent consult on my condition.  I would recommend Cynthia without reservation to provide any individual with comprehensive clinical expertise on their spine issues.|Prior to visiting Cynthia, I saw a neurologist for occipital nerve injections to assist with headaches.  My experience with Cynthia was different in the best way!  She took the time to listen, ask additional questions I hadn't been asked by the previous doctor, and explain/ clarify treatment options and next steps.  The process was more gentle and the ambience of her office was welcoming. I look forward to continuous pain management with Cynthia at Moderni Spine.",2025-02-13|2025-02-13|2024-12-08|2024-12-07|2024-08-14|2024-12-09|2024-03-30|2023-10-02,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Identifies as women-owned, Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, Free parking lot, On-site parking","What is an orthopedic clinic?","An orthopedic clinic specializes in diagnosing, treating, and preventing injuries and conditions related to the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons.",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJITx0rwQd9ocR6_b_nObIS9A,13

He is in the middle of move to a new location right now and he will do telehealths with you to make sure you are alright, I appreciate his concern and heard work. Highly recommended!|The Superior Performance team is amazing and has helped me immensely in my recovery journey back to triathlons. I started physical therapy in September of 2022 and have enjoyed every visit. Everyone is very knowledgeable, friendly, and motivating! I love the at-home exercises I received throughout my care as they're great tools to add to my training outside of the clinic. I highly recommend this incredible team for all of your PT needs!

Thanks to the SP team for getting me back to racing status - I couldn't have done it without you. Here's to a successful 2023 season!|I was so very pleased with my visit at the Superior Performance Center! The staff was welcoming and the facility was very inviting. It was such a calming environment, with a friendly professional atmosphere. I felt my opinions were valued and my privacy was respected as a client. The doctor listened to my concerns and took care of my needs, which is more than I can say about other facilities. I was pretty hurt, they shed some light on what all would work. Other places don't care too much, but they do care!|I was referred to SPC as a pain clinic, however they are not a pain clinic they are more of a Physical Therapy clinic and messages.  My severe pain was treated with medication to help me sleep.  I was also offered a treatment that the Doctor had done a few times.  He also said he could find someone that could do the procedure for me.  I was really feeling very confident in the Doctor.  The doctor also was very unprofessional, he was dressed in a running suit.  The person that assisted him had no medical knowledge and I had to repeat things multiple times because of this issue.  I believe she did the messages at this clinic.  I would ask questions and make sure they can help with what you need and not force you into something completely different!|Honestly i have never met such a wonderful staff like the Superior Performance Center's staff. The amount of excitement & eagerness they have in seeing to my mental and Physical wellness has Got me posting this Review even though I'm not the type too. With all the positive atmosphere in their facilities Im so happy to have found a group of people who have my best interests in heart. Amazing Experience!!!|I chose Superior Performance Center as my primary provider for me and my family. Not only it is easy to schedule appointment and be seen rapidly. You can even have an appointment to be seen the next day. They are very family oriented and the staff is welcoming and patient. They made us feel special!|My podiatrist recommended Superior prior to foot surgery. Lee (the physical therapist)  was incredible to work with. If you are looking for care that goes beyond what a ""big box"" ortho center offers, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everyone from the office staff to the doc, Pt and MSk specialist were thorough, friendly, and committed to helping me get back to pre-injury performance levels. After surgery, I continued PT. My surgeon attributes my quick recovery (back to hiking/biking within 6 weeks of surgery)  to the strengthening and conditioning I worked on at Superior prior to surgery. I've just ""graduated"" from physical therapy. While I am so glad to be back to my usual active self, I will truly miss the great staff and experience of working with them.

A few months later I found Dr.Hanson and he quickly operated on my failed original surgery at the L4 disc. The 2nd time around when he did it was so different. He was fast and I was in much less pain start to finish. My surgery now 6 months out has gone smoothly and I can back to living a normal life. If you are wondering where to go for spine surgery, Dr.Hanson is the needle in the haystack!!|I had lumbar spinal stenosis with pain in my buttocks and back of upper thighs for 6 months. Tried conservative approaches to try and alleviate the condition with no success. This included drugs, cortisone shots, chiropractor treatments and physical therapy. I was introduced to MN Spine by the chiropractor I was seeing. I had a teleconference with Dr. Hanson who had my MRI's and was able to tell me how he would use a minimally invasive procedure to remove the bone spurs compressing my nerves and causing me the pain. I had talked to a couple of other surgeons who wanted to perform 1- 2 fusions, and remove bone spurs. This would entail cutting me open from the front and moving my aorta and then cutting me open from the back. 5-6 hours with 6-month recovery. Dr. Hanson assured me that would not be necessary. Procedure was 1 hour with estimated 6-week recovery. I am in week two and feel almost 100%. Cannot praise Dr. Hanson and his staff enough. Had another surgeon who had previously performed back surgery look over Dr. Hanson's background. He told me that Dr. Hanson was very well trained and not to give a second thought in using him. Procedure was done at Burnsville Surgery Center and this is a top-class facility. I would echo the same sentiments as the surgeon who told me to not have second thoughts in using Dr. Hanson.
Excellent job with fantastic results. Jackie, his assistant was also excellent. Communication is great, Dr. Hanson provides his personal cell phone number for questions/concerns. Never heard of another Doctor that does that. He listens to your questions /concerns and takes the time to address them.|I had debilitating nerve pain from disk compression and bone spurs for years. Finally found Dr Hanson through a friend. My experience from start to finish was first class. I found Dr Hanson to be friendly, took his time to understand my concerns and highly skilled and meticulous with artificial disk replacement.  His entire staff at his clinic and at the surgical center were friendly caring experts. I had more pain after a dental visit than post op disk replacement.  Looking forward to getting my active lifestyle back thanks to Dr Hanson and his staff!
Highly recommend Dr Hanson!|Update to my deleted review.

I'd like to apologize personally to Dr. Hanson. I made a judgement error. I thought I had post surgical complication. But it turns out I have Carpal tunnel in both hands.

So for that I'm sorry Dr. Hanson

My surgery with Dr. Hanson was a success. He is a one of kind down to earth surgeon and deserves a 5 STAR review.

To you and your amazing staff. Thank you.
And thanks for putting up with me.|I was referred to Dr. Hanson as a Top Tier Dr. from insurance. I talked to a handful of people who had seen him & highly recommended him as well. I was told by another surgeon that I needed to have surgery ASAP. I wasn't in a severe situation, but he was concerned that if I hit a pothole while driving, I could be paralyzed. That sounded pretty severe to me, so I was confused about how I wasn't considered severe but needed to have surgery right away because of potholes. So I opted for a second opinion. That 2nd opinion was that of Dr. Hanson. Dr. Hanson gave it to me straight & said I'm not ready for surgery because it would limit my mobility & he didn't feel it was necessary without trying other things first. I've started doing the procedures suggested by Dr. Hanson & have had good results so far. Even though I have moved on with my care to another Dr. & facility, I received a message from Melina at Dr. Hanson's office wanting to update my chart with the info from the procedures I've had done with the new Dr.  I've NEVER had another Dr. or clinic follow-up after I'm technically not a patient anymore. There is a chance I will have to see Dr. Hanson again, so I feel very confident that they will be able to give me the same fantastic care in the future.  I'm so grateful I chose to get a 2nd opinion & it was with Dr. Hanson.  It's the best decision I've made in my search for pain relief.|I had severe back pain and a pinched sciatic nerve. An MRI showed I had a spinal cyst, I was told open back surgery was my only option until I found Dr. Hanson. Dr. Hanson did a minimally invasive surgery to remove my cyst and decompress my sciatic nerve. My incision is so small you can barely see it. I was feeling better the day after surgery. A month later I am feeling amazing. I highly recommend Dr. Hanson and his team to anyone having any back or neck issues. They are amazing, thank you for my life back Dr. Hanson!|Doctor Hanson is an awesome surgeon. He has the skills and training to perform minimally invasive surgeries, that have helped me with painful lower back and neck issues. Doctor Hanson takes as much time as necessary to review your scans and discuss all the options available to resolve your issue. He personally follows up after your procedure and is readily available if you have a question or issue after the surgery. Every surgery he has performed for me, including a fusion on my lower back and an artificial disc replacement in my neck have been successful, with minimal down time and quick recoveries. I have and will continue to put my trust and health in Doctor Hanson's hands.|Update: We finally were able to schedule a consultation with Dr. Hanson and he appears very knowledgeable and was able to explain procedure in detail and answer our questions. Wish would not have to wait 4 weeks. Thanks to Jackie who was kind and helped to make the consultation happen, therefore I am changing my initial review from 1 to 3.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attempted to schedule a virtual consultation with Dr. Hanson as an option advertised on the clinic website. Was told they need all the records, then they will schedule a consult. After mailing all the records and a CD, I never received any updates on when my consultation will be scheduled.When called was promised to receive a call the following week but again have not heard anything. Asked to at least return the CD as I am going to a different provider now and even that could not be accomplished. Unfortunately very poor impression of this clinic and now reading other reviews I am glad I did not choose to receive care there. It's sad as perhaps Dr. Hanson is a good MD but since I never got a chance to meet with him, my overall rating for this facility is low.",2024-11-14|2024-05-29|2023-10-24|2024-05-01|2023-08-08|2021-04-24|2021-04-24|2022-10-01,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|3,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|2 p.m.",68|67.4|60,"Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","How experienced is the doctor?","Dr. Hanson is one of the distinguished spine surgeons to perform endoscopic spine surgery in the area and has been recognized by industry leading trade publication, Becker's Spine Review.

I had been chasing a problem for almost three years. I had originally gone to another TMJ clinic and it was an awful experience. I was feeling a little defeated but Dr. Strief listened to my concerns and took the time to really to get the bottom of what was going on. He came up with a plan and the results have been amazing. Literally night and day. The office staff is so friendly and know you by name which is so nice. I am so happy and could not recommend them enough.|Twin Cities TMJ & Facial Pain Clinic is the place to go for excellent service, care for the clients, helpful resources, integrity, and for the best help for TMJ pain to be resolved.   Dr. David C. Streif,  DDS is the very best doctor I have ever had in all the many years I have experienced problems with my TMJ disorder.   He is professional, friendly,  very knowledgeable, and truly cares for each of his clients who he is helping to get pain relief.  He has made me dental appliances to wear nightly to help align my jaw joints correctly, to help me with the wear and tear that happens to our jaw joints if we grind or clench our teeth, and he has custom made these appliances to fit correctly over my teeth.  He will make sure the fit for these appliances is perfect.  He is a wonderful doctor!   He has surely hired all of the right staff also-  Kim who works at the front desk,  answering calls and making you feel welcome, always with a smile.  Chelle is there to help Dr. Streif get your night guard ready for you, and Jessica is there to assist you also with your night guard and walk you back to the front desk after your appointment is over.  The entire staff all work as a team together and their teamwork is outstanding.  Please give the Twin Cities TMJ & Facial Pain Clinic a call if you are in any TMJ pain or facial pain.  There are solutions and they can be found right here!

I would like to add more to my earlier review that I made several years ago for Dr. Streif. I had not seen him or his staff in over two years, but just came into his office on March 5, 2024. I can't thank him enough for his kindness, caring, concerned attitude, compassion, and professionalism he treats his patients with. Dr. Streif truly wants to see you get out of your pain and will help you do just that. He goes the extra mile for us, works out the best plan for helping you achieve your goals, and he wants you to have a happy life. He truly cares about you as a person and demonstrates that by his words and actions. His staff works with you also, letting you know as well that you matter, and your desire to get out of your pain is important to them. I would say that Dr. Streif and his team treat you as they would treat a family member. A big thank you to Dr. Streif, Kim, and Michelle who definitely helped me so very much when I was there on March 5th!|I have had severe TMJ since I was 10 years old.  I wasn't aware that there were TMJ specialists out there.  My dentist referred me to see Dr. Streif.  Dr. Streif was extremely attentive and created a night guard for me.  It was completely different than any previous dental appliance I have received.  My jaw pain went from a 8/10 to a 0/10.  I am very grateful.  The office team is goes above and beyond as well.  I had a lot of issues with my insurance/billing.  The office team help guide me through the situation and reached out to my insurance company multiple times. I would suggest anyone with TMJ pain to see Dr/ Streif and his team.|After a long, confusing exam the doctor recommended therapy at the therapist next door to his clinic. Both the exam and something like 8 therapy sessions were a waste of time.

My jaw pain has barely improved and the recommended therapists have run out of ideas on how to treat it. I guess I'll ask my family doctor if she has any other options because I'm not going back.|Dr Streif is one of the best doctors I have ever seen!  My issue was somewhat unique, and Dr. Streif took the time to fully assess my situation and got down to the root cause of my issue by asking numerous questions, listening, looking at x-rays, and examination.  He even provided me with a hard copy summary of my visit before I left the office, and it included the diagnose, assessment, treatment plan, and costs.  What set this visit apart from other doctor visits was Dr. Streif's thorough assessment (making me feel confident in the diagnosis), listening skills (didn't feel rushed), and kindness (I felt as though he cared about me and my situation).
Great doctor, would definitely see again and recommend!|Very nice doctor and staff. The night guard has solved all of my jaw issues. Thank you!|Very rude front desk staff every time we called or went in. Called once because of unbearable pain and was referred to the website.

The appointment as a whole went a lot better than I expected. The support staff member was also great and I am definitely going to go back to continue treatment. (I am being seen for migraines/neck pain, and regular adjustments)

It's a small, homey office that definitely has the personal touch every patient craves for when looking for any kind of wellness clinic. 5 stars!|I have been adjusted by Dr Jason for many years. He is AWESOME and so are his techniques - he adjusts from head to toe. He is the best chiropractor for me (stopped looking). I highly recommend Dr Jason...you won't be disappointed!|Dr. Jason has a gift. I suffered with military deployment related issues ranging from concentration, back and neck pain and digestion. I was pretty fit, but still couldn't get my body healed and functioning normally. The VA did some chiro stuff, but it was very limited. Dr. Jason knows my specific issues, and can quickly and easily address them in a short visit. If I'm on top of proper stretching and staying active a single adjustment can last weeks. When I'm traveling or stuck in the office I'll pop in and get a quick adjustment when needed. Very reasonable prices, and works with most insurances. Recently I've brought my 8.5 month pregnant wife in, and should honestly couldn't believe the relief she felt from being adjusted this close to birth.|I've been to several different chiropractors.  Recently I was going to one 3 days a week for a few months, but not feeling better.  I decided to go elsewhere.  After one adjustment with Dr Jason, I felt better than I had in years!!!  Best chiropractor I've ever been to!

I had been skeptical of acupuncture, and needles, for my entire life. She knowledgeably put my mind at ease the first visit. I had thought that there is no way poking me with a bunch of needles would relieve my pain, but I no longer think that. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and a couple other medical problems, and even after the first visit I could notice a difference in my pain level. The pain relief I receive from going has improved my quality of life, and I look forward to going. Her personality and professionalism can't be beat! The office is easy to get to, nicely decorated, and very clean. She is now a part of my weekly routine, hopefully, for a long time!|I have seen Dr. Kyu and Dr. Chang for acupuncture therapy for about 6-8 months now after going through pain therapy and PT with the Minneapolis VA. They are absolutely wonderful!

If you are skeptical or nervous about recieveing acupuncture therapy, go or call in and outline your questions comments and concerns. They have been a great resource and have explained the different mind sets and methodologies held to be successful here.

For me this has been a great avenue after traditional western medicine was unable to identify or acknowledge the issues I was faced with.

While there is no cure for the aches and pains I deal with, this place has definitely been able to tone the pain down to be manageable compared to the last several years of ongoing back and knee pain from army related injuries.

My advice is go in with an open mind and be willing to listen if you have any reservations on pursuing alternate pain management methods|I go to Lifetree for acupuncture with Amber and it's the number one thing I look forward to each week. First of all, it's helped me tremendously with my allergies, inflammation and hormones. It has also helped me greatly with pain. It's the best thing I've ever come across. Amber is absolutely wonderful. She is very knowledgeable, kind, gentle, takes interest in what is going on, and so much more. The clinic is peaceful and relaxing. It's one of my favorite places to be. So grateful for Amber and this clinic.|Wonderful place! I was completely skeptical of acupuncture, but the VA Pain Clinic said I should give it a try. I have Degenerative Disc Disease, Spinal Stenosis and Spinal Arthritis (I guess I hit the jackpot!) and have only had two visits thus far, but the results have been impressive. Highly recommended. Good people, great ambiance and even better great results.|Amazing clinic! Amber is fantastic, she makes you feel comfortable, easy to talk to, and she's a great listener. I am already seeing amazing results with stress management, anxiety and weight loss. I would recommend to all my friends and family!|I came in for treatment of pain and received acupuncture, manual therapy, and Reiki with Dr. Karen Chang. All 3 were really helpful, especially the Reiki sessions. I've had a couple dozen treatments and am still continuing to go over a year later. It has both reduced my pain and other symptoms too when they come up. I've had chronic pain for many years and nothing has worked completely until I tried Reiki and I finally got relief! I always leave the clinic feeling wonderful and pain free. I highly recommend this clinic for acupuncture and Reiki.|My appointment was canceled for no reason. I was looking forward to my initial consultation for over a month and I received an email stating my appointment was canceled. I tried to call the clinic and nobody answers.

Dr. Tae called me and apologized for the inconvenience. I was able the schedule with in a week for my first visit. I am impressed with Lifetree Clinic and will be returning in the future.|After a car accident I tried physical therapy, chiropractic care and orthopedic specialists with no satisfaction. Acupuncture was something I just didn't believe in but I reached a point where my pain was taking over my life. So I took a chance and I couldn't be more happy with the results. Now I have almost no pain and the movement in my back and neck have improved by 85%. It was the least invasive and least costly of all the treatments I tried.

Everyone there is so kind, friendly and supportive in your journey back to optimum health. I would highly recommend their services to anyone dealing with pain management.
Debbie Krenz|Advantage Health Group is in a class of their own! Their approach to healing pain is unlike any other.

I've battled with chronic pain for over 20 years. I'm a past competitive figure skater and while it was loads of fun, my body took a beating. I had a hip replaced 10 years ago, and while it fixed the obvious problem, it created other issues after it healed. Since seeing Dr Davis, my hip has never felt better! I've dealt with chronic lower back pain as well, and that has subsided too!

I learned to live with pain for years until I met Dr Davis, Dr Beau, Dr Ben, Allison and Katie. This team really cares about people and with the experience and knowledge they have, PEOPLE WILL LEAVE CHANGED...physically and mentally.

I cannot say enough positive things about Advantage Health Group. Superior!|Advantage Health Group is the real deal! I'm a long distance runner and had been suffering from persistent hip and shin pain for months before coming to them. I have several races on my schedule this year and was concerned that I would be sidelined and miss out on events I'd worked hard to qualify for. From the moment I started working with Dr. Davis, Allison and the team at Advantage, I knew I was in the right place. Dr. Davis approached my treatment methodically and focused on identifying the root cause of my problems vs. treating the symptoms. He paired in-clinic treatment with at-home drills that had direct and measurable impact. Over the course of my treatment, I was able to ramp up mileage and intensity without the pain returning. There were times when I'd come into an appointment truly flabbergasted by how effective the treatment was and how good I felt. The entire team is warm, welcoming and super knowledgeable. I cannot say enough good things about the professionals at Advantage Health Group. They do incredible work and exceed expectation.|I had been suffering from knee pain and Dr.Davis got to the bottom of it like a detective! Advantage Health Group really took the time to listen and come up with comprehensive plan for me.|It was September of 2022 when I was referred to Advantage Health Group. I spent the previous 3 years seeing everybody and trying everything to figure out why I was in so much pain. I had an X-Ray and an MRI and I saw four spine specialists, 3 physical therapists, a nerve specialist, a Gastrologist, and many women's health doctors. I couldn't workout, travel in a car for more than 30 minutes, or sleep without being in extreme pain. Nobody could figure it out until I came to Advantage Health Group.  I walked in and Tricia (Bless her heart) greeted me right away with a huge smile and made me feel very welcomed. Katey then sat down with me in a room and let me know the next steps and she calmed my nerves and let me know I was in good hands as another new Doctor was going to review my case. Dr. Licktieg came in and was the first Doctor in 3 years to spend more than 10 minutes with me. I think it ended up being an hour or so and he listened to my entire case and asked so many questions (which I appreciated). Nothing was missed and I finally had a diagnosis praise the Lord!  I spent the next several months being treated and regaining movement and flexibility. Dr. Bovre  then started working on strength exercises with me and I finally started feeling like myself again. Do your exercises people!  Dr. Davis Bates and Dr. Beau Bates also listened to my concerns and helped out whenever it was needed. It hasn't been an easy road but all four Doctors got me in every time I was in pain and sent me home without pain and more exercises to help reduce future pain. So to Dr. Davis Bates, Dr. Bovre, Dr. Lickteig, Dr. Beau Bates, Tricia, Katey, and Allison THANK YOU for giving me my life back.

Short version:
The waiting room is crowded and smells like dirty clothes.
Some of the staff show frustration and a lack of concern.
I waited nearly two hours before walking out.

Full version:
The first thing I noticed when entering the building was the smell, which reminded me of dirty clothes. The hard, plastic seats were crammed together to seat as many people as possible, and none of the receptionists seemed to notice me standing at the window for what felt like a full minute.

I had arrived fifteen minutes early for my 12:30 appointment, finished my paperwork and began what would become a long wait. Around 1:00, I asked to use the restroom, but the receptionist refused because of a drug screen. I waited another fifteen minutes and was again told to wait because I was next in line.

(During this time, one of the nurses called patients to the back. When she learned that one of them had stepped outside, she showed frustration on her face and let out a sigh. At first, I thought it was unprofessional but understandable, but by the end of my visit, I was more on the side of the patient.)

I was finally called back at 1:20 (fifty minutes late), and the nurse offered no apology or explanation. Instead, she hurtled through a series of questions and tests, and my annoyance became anger when she thrust the thermometer into my ear with no apparent regard for my personal space. Once finished, I was finally allowed to use the restroom.

Afterward, I was instructed to sit in one of the chairs lined against a wall, and when I saw the other patients, I couldn't help but think of that scene from The Wire in which the drug dealers bark at their customers to line up so they could be quickly processed.

I waited there until 2:00 and began to wonder if I should just leave. I had already decided I wouldn't be back, so there was no point waiting another hour, but I also didn't want to leave if I was next. I approached the receptionist to ask, but while I was in mid-sentence, she walked away to answer the phone. At that point, I was finished.

I approached another receptionist and told her I wanted to end my appointment and be refunded. However, I had already taken the drug screen, so I would be charged $65 or I could wait for the manager to come and waive the fees. I was told she was speaking with the doctor, so I stood at the counter for twenty minutes, and when she finally returned, it was from the Break Room!

(I should also note that while waiting, I overheard the first receptionist tell someone on the phone that he must arrive within fifteen minutes of his appointment, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud.)

The manager was kind and apologetic and waived the fees without any hassle. She also told me this kind of wait is typical for new patients, and I left (nearly two hours late) without seeing the doctor.|I have used Dr. Barclay for several years and he is a one of a kind doctor!!! He will sit down and discuss all of my problems and always gives me what he thinks best and I do everything he tells me.Once again a very nice and devoted pain doctor!!!|Dr Vivek Barkley is absolutely the best pain management doctor I have ever had.

Dr. Dodd has consistently resolved my back pain issues and reduced my back pain from an 8 to 10 (on scale of 10) pain level to a 0-2 level. I ride horses, haul hay, hunt, snow ski, and work out lifting weights. I am a very rough and tumble guy. My quality of life changed drastically for the better with Dr. Dodd's professional expertise and medical help.Highest ratings for this doctor.|I've been a patient of Dr. Dodd's for years.  He always takes the time to listen to my concerns and explains everything thoroughly! I would highly recommend Dr. Dodd to anyone looking for a pain management doctor!|I want to start by saying Dr.D was a nice doctor that seem to genuinely care for his patients. Unfortunately, that desire to help may of stretched him into an area of practice that he didn't have much if any training in. If referred to him for spinal CSF leak treatment I'd urge you to look else where. During my procedure I ended up with a spinal puncture that caused an additional spinal CSF leak. It took getting to a speciality clinic (Duke, Durham NC) to find and patch this puncture. While reviewing the case notes it was mentioned that the wrong size needle (way too big) was used for patching increasing the chances of an additional puncture. Additionally following this procedure there was no after care which I now know is extremely important. Sweet doctor but not a spinal CSF leak doctor.|I recently made a change from neurospine to Dr. Dodd.   If you are tired of being ""just the next person in line"",  make the switch.  It was so refreshing to have a doctor that actually read my history and discussed it with me. Great doctor!|Dr Dodd, is an extremely knowledgeable and personable physician!  He intently listened to my pain conditions and now I am pain free!|Everything he told me was bull. All the injections he gave me was for naught. If he would have taken the time to look at my c-scan he would have known that injections wouldn't work. You failed and failed as my doctor to provide me with proper treatment.|Great doctor!

I have been seeing Dr. Pasha for over 14 years. He has done injections on my lower back and neck and has shaved my disks (this is after I went to a different dr and had back surgery.) & it has  helped me a lot .. He is a doctor who listens & explains everything to you.  He has a great staff of Nurse Practitioners , Clinic nurses and also a great Surgry staff &  everyone is very nice& they know what their doing. The staff they all treat you like a human & not a drug seeker. I recommend him to everyone who asks.|I had. my first visit with Dr. Pasha today. I had no wait time at all. Was called back almost immediately. Looking forward to my next visit to help with my chronic pain.
He was very thorough and caring. Thank you Dr. Pasha.|Front desk staff is very rude, even complaining to me about another patient. Found out Dr Pasha has been lying to my Aunt to keep her from switching Doctors. Steer clear of this place. Basically they are just drug dealers with degrees and no desire to help people. Seems to me the only goal here is profit. We will never use this clinic again and advise you to find someone else. His license should probably be revoked and we will be reporting this Dr to the proper authorities.|He helped me alot and spent time with me which most docs don't do now. The staff isA+  at the desk  in pre op and post op A++++ AWESOME GROUP OF NURSES!!!!!!!  Admitting nurse was outstanding.  I wish Dr Pasha  would talk more to  me more that's my only complaint!! Great Doc just doesn't  say a whole lot.  I think we got off on the wrong side on the first visit it was late in the day and we traveled over 100 miles to get there. But I stuck with him because I believed  in him after watching his videos. So I hope we can get on the right foot next time or maybe he just doesn't  talk much but I Do!  Anyway he did 6 injections in my back  and I was put I was put out for it , which was awesome . Didn't feel a thing woke up in recovery asked when we were going . I'm sticking  with him because so far he has really helped none of the pain drs around Columbus offered what he offers . They call and check up on you ,return phone calls promptly and have communication  through the internet . Haven't had any other docs do that !  I'm a retired RN after 30 years and I know a good doc when I see one even if he doesn't  say much lol. Next time I'm going to try to make him feel like he can talk to me . So pleased with place and staff I would recommend  him to anyone . I have been in pain for over 20 years and he really is the only doc that did invasive treatments. KUDOS TO ALL WHO WORK THERE THANKS SO MUCH !!!!!!!!! I hope next time I can give him a 5 star!|This was the MOST rude, combative, unhelpful, unprofessional group of ""professionals"" I have EVER encountered.
I have MS, and a back like a bag of pretzels, but felt it was worth the co-pay  to ask questions about the upcoming  "" medical marijuana"" issue. Big mistake! They treated me like I was a hoodlum from the dark side!
Dr. Pasha would interrupt me at every turn with an ""I don't care"" or a ""google it"".
I wobbled out of that appointment after 3-minutes in worse shape then when I came in.
Thanks a lot, ""doctor""....for nothing!!|Have been seeing dr pasha for over a year,my back had gotten worse tried showing him my new MRI.said he didn't have time to look at it. Very unprofessional and he got very angry with me when I asked to up my meds. For just the 1 month until i see dr stringer for my surgery. Dont waste your time with this doctor,all he cares about is a check damn sure dont care about nobody's pain. And dr pasha has a bad attitude, he dont ever discuss anything with u either.all he is worried about is giving crackheads there pills so they can go sell them. Changing to total pain in meridian hope I get better results|Having had six back surgeries, I can attest that Dr. Pasha is one of the most outstanding pain management doctors in the country. Not only that, he is a very kind and gracious person...I highly recommend him to anyone suffering from acute and chronic pain.

Just as thing throw you behind then you need to be considered of the patient the same thing can happen to them.

I saw Dr. Marshall in December and she was suppose to call in my message. Well she never did so I went up there to see why well she dropped me abs I had been going there for over 10 years. She gave me a paper showing all kinds of drugs in my test. If I had that in my system they would have said something before now but they never did. When I saw Dr. Marshall she was friendly and did not say anything about something being in my system. They made me go without my medicine all of at once. It's been hard. They done me awful with me being their patient for over 10 years. If anything was in my system it could have came from when I was in the hospital. I've been in and out the hospital every few days and they new that. Just a little warning be careful if you choose to go there.|They are a joke.  Their system is down and cannot send prescriptions to pharmacy.  When left office said it would be fixed in 45 minutes.  It has now been over 36 hours.  No prescription at pharmacy yet and do not answer the phone.  Writing this for a friend.  How can a doctor do this and why not write them a prescription when they leave the office?  Wow and this is a pain clinic.|The doctors are great at this clinic but the staff is lazy and won't answer the phones and won't return phone calls so you can get your prescriptions filled and  not very professional when answering the phone when they do decide to answer the phone. I love Dr Marshall and Dr Tyner and they had been very good as far as my care for 10 years but I'm about ready to leave this clinic and go to another where they will answer your phone calls when you need them and you will have your prescription sent to the pharmacy on time.|I have been going here for two years and now all of sudden my urine tested positive for cocaine and she discharged me! In the 52 years I've been on this earth I have NEVER used an illegal drug in my life! The nurses play and talk too much, they're rude and unprofessional. I'm currently talking to a lawyer. They're mistake can follow me anywhere I go. If you somewhere else to go I suggest you do.|NOPE! Was scheduled for surgery and they didn't send over my paper work! HIPPA violations with insurance cards laying on the front counter desk with IDS and full Medicaid card information for one! My husband and I took off work for the procedure only to find out I was never scheduled with the hospital! I waited over 2 hours and the office never sent over the paper work! I left and went elsewhere! What happen to people doing what they are paid to do? My husband and I lost vacation time and money because we took off! I so badly wanted to trust and believe in this place but after that I will not be going back and would never recommend anyone to them. It's a big NO for me!|Edit from earlier review:

Dr Marshall is amazing and speaks to me like I'm a person not just a number. She is very thorough having found an infection missed my several of my other physicians. The nursing staff is very helpful and genuinely care about your well being. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star review is due to one exceptionally rude receptionist. Other than that it is a wonderful place to go. I highly recommend it. This coming from someone who has been trying for years to find out what was wrong to finally getting a diagnosis and being in constant pain every day for the past 10 years.|They do not answer the phone ever. I work in a pharmacy and we can never get them on the phone. When I have spoken to them, everyone seems extremely rude and annoyed.|I had gave them 5 but I'm changing it because there is no one to contact during emergencies. I never tried to contact them for no reason but only for their mistakes.3x  in a row they did not send my prescription to the pharmacy, they sent it to the wrong pharmacy. They I drove around for 2 days looking for my prescriptions. Then  after the 3rd day asked me to come back to Jackson to pick up a paper prescription. I live in magnolia. They didn't apologize. Or compensate me for all the trouble I went through and my pain and suffering. Y'all know the withdrawal you go through when you run out of medication. The check out lady has a nasty attitude on the phone she was so disrespectful to me. She needs to be fired. And when their office makes mistakes. You can't even contact the nurse you get a VM. I'm supposed to get 3 prescriptions. I only got one for the whole 3 mths till I go back. I didn't even bother with them because it's a headache. I will discuss at my appointment. I'm really disappointed in their service at this time I've been a patient for 3 yrs now. But I'm going to give them another chance to get it together. Nobody is perfect. But Doctors aren't supposed to make mistakes they have ppl lives in their hands.

UPDATE:::::::::::11/08/2021
Giving an update on my service. Dr. Marshall. Here I go again going to my pharmacy and my prescription wasn't there. Would you consider this a professional business. I'm not sure who is in charge of sending the prescriptions but they need to be fired also the rude check out lady she gets 3thumbs down.Kymberly Tyner is a sweet heart wouldn't change it for nothing in the world.

I have been happy with Terressa Hewlit ever since she took over my care around 8 years ago.|Amanda is amazing!!!!she listens and truly cares about my needs.  She doesn't sugar coat anything and gets right down to finding a custom procedure that caters to my personal pain and injury.
Wish she could clone herself across all my doctors's offices.|I've been coming here for years with severe arthritis and several other conditions.  They have completely healed me on several conditions for which I'm so thankful. Hey   Other conditions that's really ongoing,
They've helped me to manage the pain.  They have been most professional but most caring on a personal level.  I've been seen by Nurse Practitioner Teresa Hewitt for about ten years and I've had around 6 or 7 surgical procedures by Dr Willow and on each one, have received the best care by everyone there and the optimum benefit was received from Dr Wilson, again, for which I've been most thankful.  I could not possibly have received better care than I have at Willow Pain and Wellness.|I have been a patient of Willow Pain and Wellness, and Dr. Kinard for a couple of years.  I have scoliosis and DDD.  I have suffered with back pain for most of my life and just dealt with the pain.  I work up one day and had trouble moving.  The pain worsened so significantly over just a few days to the point I could not function.  Dr. Kinard's staff got me in quickly and I was able and have a procedure that made my pain go from a 10 to a 2 in no time flat.

I cannot say enough about every person I came in contact with at the clinic, from the scheduler, to the front desk, to the procedure crew, and the providers.  Everyone there was the most professional I have ever met.

I have recommended this clinic to numerous friends and relatives and they have all had great experiences also.

If I ever have to have another procedure, I will not hesitate to go back!|I'm have been going to Willow pain and wellness for over 3 yrs now. I have been in so many pain mgnt centers and they are absolutely the best place I have ever been too. They treat you with respect and dignity and care so much about your well being. Dr. Hewlett has been my Dr. since I 1st started and she really cares. She always makes sure if there is a treatment I need to have done to help my pain or whatever the case is I know I'm being took care of. She always has my best interest in mind. Everyone from the front desk, nurses and Dr. Kinard that I have come in contact with are all top notch and mostly they care about you getting as well as you possibly can be. Thank you too everyone from the bottom of my heart for all you do.|I really didn't want to go to my appointment I didn't think anyone would listen how bad my pain was. Like all other ER'S and Hispitals I get a couple shots same meds the other hospitals had given me. Band-Aid care I call it. I went to Willow Wellness and had nothing but the best care from the front desk, nurse and Doctor Kinard he explained  everything to me and answered all my questions. I finally will find out just what is wrong and how we can fix it. I look forward to having Dr. Kinard handling my care. Thank you all so much.|I've been going to Willow Pain and Wellness for 3 months now. Most caring staff I've ever encountered ..from the front desk to the doctors. So personal and professional. They take time with you to figure out what's going on and plan a path of action to take to get you back going as quickly and safely as possible. I'm so thankful for each and every one of them.|I definitely will recommend this place to anyone I know who needs it. From the front desk to everyone I have had the pleasure of meeting especially Theresa the CPN have all been super friendly and helpful. Christy got me in very quickly for my first appointment and two days later I had my first round of injections. They have a great staff at the hospital also. I can't thank Dr. Kinard enough for taking a great amount of time listening to my needs (a rarity today, unfortunately) and explaining his priorities to giving me the best care possible.

She explained everything and it made sense what she was saying. I waited way too long for her to get back (from lunch) per her RN, even though I was on time even early. I didn't get any pain relief and was told she would not give me any type of pain relief if I was having surgery that she weens people off their meds prior so at a level of pain that brought tears no I did not get any help n left feeling that I wasn't obviously going to stop suffering anytime from her services so I will not be seeing that clinic again. I needed help that very moment and was rejected. But like I said she was accurate in her observations and that I can not fail her for.

She keeps making me appointment for shoulder specialist even when my doctor says I don't need surgery. On my appointment on the Dec 4,2024 I arrived at appointment at 8:15. It was 10:00 when I asked the lady why haven't she seen me yet because I had an eye appointment in Grenada an my appointment is at 11. They asked me would I like to reschedule my appointment after waiting 2 hours. I said no. Then she finally came in the room with a nasty attitude. I said I have been coming here for 6 months no other nurses have treated me like this. She is very very unprofessional and needs to be supervised while seeing patients.

I was in severe pain in lower back and right leg. I called them and was given an appointment 2 weeks out. Nothing was done but a drug test and an appointment for a MRI, which took an additional week. Waited 2 weeks from the original appointment for a follow up and to get a resolution started. My drug test was clean and MRI results were L5 at S1 has mild buldge pushing on nerves to right leg. I was literally 10 minutes away on the day of appointment and they called to say the provider canceled my appointment. I was given no further explanation, only told that that the nurse would get the message when they were out of clinic. They didn't even offer a reschedule. Keep in mind I never received any pain management at all.|The wait time is ridiculous even with an early morning appt. I had an 8 Am appt and didn't get in til 9. Then they took patients ahead of me to schedule the next test. My time is as valuable as theirs.|These people are awesome. Especially the
CNP who changed my life monorterig my pain situation. I would recommend this facility to anyone who suffers with pain|Can only rate this place based on my provider there. The provider was Nicole Taylor, like many of the others I would give a zero if allowed. She was hateful from the start, I guess old white man is not her preferred demographic, or at least the way I was made to feel by her. She wrote me a prescription that 3 different pharmacist said they had not seen in over a year.  They thought it was discontinued. Then changed  that to one, that only one place had and it was almost six hundred dollars. Ask her to change back to what I had, so I would have something. She refused and left me with nothing. Don't bother calling the CARE number, some woman called back claiming to be manager for the place,  all she did is start telling me I was wrong.  Called back to CARE LINE NEVER HEARD A WORD,  I do have a question, if a provider put in visit notes that certain things were discussed, but in reality the subject was never mentioned is that not falsifying records?

Edit:  if you notice in NMMC response to me they invited me to contact them through the website.  I did fill out the form on Monday night. Tuesday,Wednesday and now Thursday afternoon and nothing. They just want to look like they care.|The best group on people I have ever experienced. Dr. Windham and his staff honestly care about your well being. These people have restored my faith in the medical industry. I have been the multiple times and it has always been a great experience.

Jason Throop|I am deeply disappointed by the quality of service I experienced at North MS Regional Pain Consultants. My recent encounter was the worst experience I have ever had. Scheduling appointments was a cumbersome process, often requiring weeks of waiting. Furthermore, the care provided by the NP's was subpar, with unnecessary tests being ordered solely for billing purposes, leading to prolonged physical therapy sessions with minimal benefit. The nurses exhibited unprofessional behavior, displaying rudeness and a lack of preparedness, as evidenced by their failure to review my medical history before appointments. This negligence was further highlighted by a misinterpretation of my drug test results, indicating positive for medications I had recently been prescribed postpartum. The overall disorganization and lack of communication within the office only compounded my frustration, resulting in unnecessary confusion and numerous follow-up calls. This experience falls far below the standard of care expected. The overall disorganization, lack of communication, and rudeness within the office are deeply concerning, leading to confusion and frustration.|The back procedure I endured was a three step process. It was necessary to complete each step and have certain results to proceed to the next step. The third step is where the desired maximum pain relief occurs. I completed the first two steps and met with the nurse practitioner to discuss the third step. It was only then that I was told positive results could last from four months to four years. WOW. I was not willing to go to the expense and pain for a possible four months of relief. I should have this information to make an informed decision up front. Perhaps it was withheld on purpose because if all patients knew this business might be drastically reduced.|I just want to say that my mom is now clean of all narcotics that you tried to keep her on when she did not need to be. You had her addicted to all kinds of pain medication's, and tranquilizers and fentanyl. I detoxed her at home twice. Remember me the first time I got her off of everything then you turned around and put her on it again. Well, I detoxed her the second time after I threw a fit and made you tear up all of her fentanyl patches she is a year, clean and doing very well thanks to me, and the good Lord above.

One was when they put a spinal stimulator in and told me she had to take medication right when she got home but after asking about the prescription twice found out there was no prescription and ended up having to wait hours because office staff didn't feel it was important to alert a physician. Then, patient was treated like an active drug addict but wasn't on any narcotics. They told the patient she needed a hip replacement but that took time since she is 100% reliant on me and my husband so we
Had to wait until her out of pocket was met. They told her about the pain but offered no help until we saw Dr. Burns. He was willing to help her. After she healed from hip surgery THE PATIENT asked to be taken off of pain medication but spoke to him about spasms in her muscles so they agreed to keep her on muscle relaxers. She explained the ones she was currently taking seemed to be too strong and asked if they could try another one to see if that helped. They didn't. So we went back but this time we saw Ashley who had a tendency not to listen. She told the patient that she wouldn't change the muscle relaxer back to what it originally was instead of talking to doctor burns at her earliest convenience and made her feel like she was being treated like a drug addict once again. We were released by the end of the week because I just couldn't take Ashley treating her like that anymore.

Please find other care. This just isn't it. I have saved a few people who have been referred to them from their unfair treatment and blind eyes and I would hope whoever sees this will take this review as a warning. Total Pain Care as a whole just doesn't care. Ashley doesn't care. We have since found a better option and quality care and the patient is thriving compared to what she was under Ashley. We are pleased with the results since being fired by this clinic.|Horrible service! Dr cook, was scheduled to see patients and do surgery in the same day, so location was changed and was NOT aware.  Other patients had been waiting 2 hours plus. Secretary said it was unprofessional also. I was 15-30 late due to a wreck occurring IN FRONT of me and stopped to help the injured woman out of her car WHILE the woman was pinned in the vehicle and had to take a sawzal and cut the vehicle to get her out. Had to cut her out and keep her conscious and wound up a little later than expected.|My mother-in-law went for her first appointment and it was a nightmare! The doctor was rude, wouldn't take the time to listen, and when she continued asking questions she was told if she complained they would refuse to see her at all. When you're in pain from 4 metal joints and an arthritic ridden body at 77 years old, you should be allowed to complain as much as you wish! Doctors make enough money to listen and actually care for their patients. These folks just want you in and out. They took x-rays as she was LEAVING! Those are needed before and during the appointment, so that's an obvious money grab. To say the least, we're taking her elsewhere. Don't waste your time on this place. The bad reviews are true|I couldn't ask for better care!! Erin Farmer is absolutely amazing and truly cares about her patients. Dr. Tyler Burns performs my surgeries and he's so down to earth. My nurse Shannon is hands down the sweetest. From the minute my husband and I are checked in to the time we leave, we are treated with respect and listened to. They have gone above and beyond for the both of us.|My experience at the center was OK. The man at the reception desk was kind as were the nurses in the surgical center. I drove 3 hours and was told by the intake group that I likely wouldn't see a doctor today because I was 15 minute late. Whatever, it was 10. I was seen and had a cervical epidural that did not take.

Later, I received a bill for an additional $541 for ""office fees,"" so be sure you inquire about those before you agree to services. The woman in billing was condescending and plain RUDE. She must have a miserable life. Bless her. :(|It's not my favorite, they act like we are criminals, I loved dr Cook, & dr. Oliver, my new NP is ok.|I didn't like the service at all the staff wasn't pleasant and the doctor didn't listen to my complaints did do any exam I was there for my pain medication to be renewed and she gave me nerves pills that I clearly said I was allergic to.

The nurse practitioners I saw were always compassionate and helpful (Emily was the last one - she is excellent). I was referred to their Meridian location where I got stem cell treatment from Dr. Pearson in my spine discs and it changed my life for the better. I still have some minor issues but I didn't need to keep going monthly to the doctor. In fact I haven't been back in over 3 years.

I changed my insurance to Humana, he got really upset, and even raised his voice to me!! Told the nurse to not put the IV in, and asked me why I changed insurance!!! Said I could pay for the procedure and let insurance company reimburse me! Told me Humana wasn't any good, and everyone was going to stop taking it!! I was there for injections in my back! It was even a couple sitting on the other side of the screen who were also shocked the way he talked to me, as the nurse was also! After that his office totally changed towards me!! I was supposed to get an appointment to get nerves burned in my back, didn't hear from them after two weeks, so I called . Jessica his nurse told me the insurance denied the procedure!! I called the insurance company, it hadn't been denied, Dr. McLeod canceled it! They just out and lied! I got the insurance company to send me a copy of it!! I called his office again and spoke with Jessica about my concerns of being discriminated against because of my insurance, and what she told me wasn't true!!! Also told her I'd find another Doctor because I didn't feel safe with Dr. McLeod doing anything to me!! After the way I was being treated, I'm not taking any chances! She said ok! Never even tried to deny anything!! I'm still just in shock over it! They acted very unethical. Mississippi Sports Medicine takes Humana PPO, but Dr. McLeod doesn't like it! I have filed a grievance with my insurance company!! And have contacted MSM about how I was treated! McLeod knows he was wrong, and he knows exactly what I'm talking about!!!|I was highly impressed with Dr. McLeod and staff. He listened attentively to me as his patient.

Definitely would recommend them to everyone.|After 7 years of being treated my Dr. pretty much accused me of selling my medications since I forgot to get one refilled. Although I never failed a drug test, had not gotten any refilled and had more medicine than supposed to or even asked a reason to why. (I am busy) They were more concerned about their license instead of my health. Still in shock on how I was treated after 7 years...|Very short wait - in and out in 45 minutes. Always friendly staff.

During all of this waiting in the hallway, not one person seemed to notice that we had been there that long or cared. People were walking back and forth past us, including the doctor who I didn't know would be my husband's.

I was speaking to a friendly person in this office about my appointment with Dr. Chen and when she put me on hold another person named Renee picked up and asked if I was Shannon to which I said no, and she said well you don't have to get an attitude!, Which was extremely rude.! I just wonder if Dr. Chen and his associates know how his staff treats his patients, and I will definitely be sure to let him know.

I would never have achieved these answers had it not been for the willingness to listen and advocate for my care shown by my NP....and not simply administer meds to mask the disease progression. I now require further extensive treatment and the goal is remission, but I am grateful to have dedicated care and concern and ability to ease my ever growing pain along the way.|I have used Joe Chen MD and staff several times.

Days 2 two days to come up with a 25$ payment. I had caught up and owed $25 and they called me on the 1st and said they needed that $25 or they were going to terminate there services I asked if it could be payed on the 3rd because that's when I get payed and the answer was no now or your letter gets mailed out today.

And when you protest about the way you are being treated they will fake a bad UA to get you out the door before you become a issue, matter of fact they will call you day's later and say there was a problem on your last UA even though if there was it would show the day you dropped it. Beware of this place and the way they handle things.|I'd like to give ZERO stars due to the lack of customer SERVICE. I returned a phone call that I received, the person that answered the phone said ""just a minute"" and placed me on hold, I was on hold for NINETEEN MINUTES! That is NOT good customer SERVICE!
If the office was busy and I do understand offices can get busy and a customer may be placed on hold for a moment BUT NOT NINETEEN MINUTES, at least come back and acknowledge the caller, say I'm sorry we're busy at the moment may I take your information and someone will call you back?

No one did that! I finally hung up and called back; after this second call back and a few minutes someone answered the phone, I told her I was previously on hold for 19 minutes she didn't care, I said no worries about my injection, the injection did not work and I will not be returning to this office again....

No one should be put on hold for 19 minutes. The proper customer service telephone etiquette would be 1-2 minutes tops , NOT 19 minutes AND at least come back to the phone to acknowledge the caller/customer: ""I do apologize we are very busy at the moment, may I take down your phone number and someone will give you a call back as soon as possible, if not today then tomorrow.""

Called yesterday to see if they would closed today as the schools are and I drive about an hour. There is no answer from 7:30am until 8:30am today. Took an hour to get an answer yesterday.  Will continue to call there is no answering machine or answering service. First medical office that isnt accessible.  Doctors and nurse are good, . The front desk people don't seem to be considered with patients who call. So I need to reschedule my appointment as I'm not going to risk others or my safety by driving in snow and sleet. I'll bet I don't get a response. I have worked in Doctors office and hospital in office role. The staff is the worst I've ever been exposed to. They treate me like I'm bothering them. They all need to be fired or have customer service training.  I had a card with appointment time written on it, as wellbas the time in my phone, the calendar at my house and when I arrived after long drive they told me I was an hour late and wouldn't attempt to work me in. The reason was they close period at noon. The patients are irrelevant. They get paid because we come to see Doctor or NP NOT THEM.|Have been going here almost a year. Dr Cole is a great doctor, staff is too never really had problems till now. Been in pain management for over 10yrs and now I have a doctor that's giving me problems, wonder if he treats everyone like that.|Dr. Alan Cole and his staff are very wonderful people. Dr Cole listens to your concerns and addresses everything and fully helps his patients get back to a normal life and his staff are not only very wonderful there are nice, kind, sweet and very helpful. I would recommend this place to everyone|Dr. Cole is great at what he does but I have to say that his Front Desk Staff are absolutely horrible! They are rude and very inconsiderate of people's issues. How can you work in the Medical Field and not have a compassionate and nice way about you! I had one hang the phone up in my face! What kind of professional does that. She got mad because I told her she was being rude and she was. Hanging up in my face proved it. That front desk staff are not whose supposed to be there. And that response to the reviews apologizing is a Joke that don't care they just think everyone that comes in there is just looking for Drugs! Newsflash people there are real people out here in pain! Please do better! I love Dr Cole he actually cares I would hate to have to leave him because of Front Desk Staff|The physicians are great and actually listen to me. However as far as executing referrals or follow up with treatment is absolutely horrible. Mr Garret NP having trying to get a referrals done to merit neurology for MONTHS. Everything I call merit for this they've not received any referrals and when I call ms pain and migraine about this I receive no help.|The Physician's here are great. The office staff on the other hand , have no empathy no compassion no respect for the patients whom they come in contact with. I have never seen office staff that answers the phone and put people on hold before the patient can speak. I've read the reviews of this office, the providers are going to lose patients based on their office staff , they are the chief complaint of each review. What more will it take for someone to step in and take the proper steps to get things under control? Working in healthcare is not always easy but no matter if patients or patients family members give you a hard time there is never a reason for this type of behavior. The generic responses is confirmation that each review is being over-looked. Prescription mix ups , no communication, short snobby sentences, from nurses will make people question the future of healthcare. I hate to see such great providers be brought down by rude nurses and front seat receptionist.|Dr cole is great and NP Garrett Jones is great.  Office Manager not so great!  She will not return emails or phone calls, no one in the office and give you a number to call for billing.  Been trying to get a bill straight for 5 months with out any luck.  Many calls and emails sent!|After reading reviews.  I will not be making an appointment.  I worked in the medical field for 30 years.

I just don't approve of some of the policies that the pain clinic have for patients. Like for instance,I was told I had alcohol in my system which was beer. The only reason for that was because,I was told by one of the nurses at the Granada,MS. Hospital because it could be helpful for my blatter and kidney. Which I just had a prostate urolift procedure on 10/08/2024. I'm trying to see what's wrong with alcohol being in your system just because I'm taking painkillers for my pain that I have do to a neck fusion surgery. I can understand if I was a drug addict or a person who abused drugs,but I'm neither and have no record of being one. It's just these pain management facilities are adding to much to their policies, almost like they are trying to stop patients that really have pain problems from getting the proper care or medication that they need and they know it.

I'm not the type of person to leave reviews but I felt like I needed to do so now. There is no communication between doctors and patients or at least in my experience. He called in some medication a while back and I was never informed after I was told they would get back in contact with me. (I wasn't able to go to work for two days because I wasn't able to sit for more than 10-15 minutes). I have called multiple times to leave a message for the doctor and it was never put in. About a month ago he told me he was going to refer me to a different doctor. I never heard anything back so I called back to the office today and spoke to one of the receptionist at the flowood and she told me that a referral was sent to a completely different office I don't necessarily want to go there but at this point it's fine I just want to be treated and figure out what's wrong. There definitely needs to be more communication through the clinic with the patients. I wish the best for these offices and hope everything gets situated. A big shoutout goes to Debbie at the flowood clinic for being so kind and understanding every time I would call.

It stinks for the nice people that they do still have working there.|I don't usually write reviews, but this place is ridiculous.  From the very first appointment.  I get there about 10mins early, walk in and there are about 5 people in front of me.  2 clerks at the desk and one is on her cell phone with a call, that was not business related from what I could hear, 10 minutes later she decides that it's time to help out.  After my appointment I was scheduled for injections for pain.  The day before my appointment for injections I get a call to tell me what time the appointment will be and that I will have a $100+ copay.  I informed them that VA would be paying for everything.  They rescheduled my appointment for a month later so that they could get the authorization code.  Today is the day before my new appointment, a month later, and they still don't have the authorization code because they did absolutely nothing, so now it looks like the appointment will be cancelled again.

Second issue was my pain meds.  I went to my appointment on a Thursday and waited in the lobby for a good 2 hours for a 10 minute appointment with the Doc just so that he could verify that I am on 4 separate medications.  I get my 2 pain med prescriptions that can't be called in and leave.  I have 2 other meds in my file that needed to be refilled that should be called in since I am still taking them.  I go to pick up meds on Friday afternoon, and medication is not there, because no one had called them in.  Call Docs office first thing Monday morning to get my meds called in and the Doc and nurse out for the week.  I was informed that I cannot get the meds filled and the other Doc in the office, who I am scheduled to see in 2 weeks, wont fill them because they have never seen me.  I had to go a full week without the meds that I needed.  The following Monday morning the Docs office calls and asks me what pharmacy I use so they could call in the medication.  Monday afternoon I call the pharmacy to verify that meds are ready and nothing has been called in.  So I call the Docs office to find out what is going on, and without asking name or anything, I am told that it could take 1-2 days to call in the medication.  Overall this place has been horrible to deal with.  I live in Meridian and was looking forward to not having to drive an hour and a half.  But at this point I would just about drive to the moon.|The best treatment you can get, the Doctors and nurses, also staff are more than helpful, and they will go out of there way to do more than expected  than any other hospital I've ever been to, Thank you all and the best of luck to all at Rush|Wrong diagnosis and charged me for a shot I didn't receive!|Dr Cook Great but he's not there anymore.

I absolutely Love him. He takes the time out to answer any questions that I have.

Dr Mei specializes in pain management. He has done injections on my back and neck which has helped me so much.

The office staff is very nice. The wait time has improved from a year ago. I only waited about 20 minutes.

I Definitely recommend using Dr Mei, if you are in any pain.|Dr. Mei is a wonderful doctor--kind, compassionate, helpful, and a good listener. He follows medical best practices, including having patients bring all of their medication to ensure the best care possible. His staff is also knowledgeable and helpful. I am very grateful to have been referred to his office for help with long-term pain management because I could not ask for a better doctor!|Dr. Mei has been a great doctor for me. I was hurting so bad before seeing him but now I am doing so much better!! I highly recommend Dr. Mei.|Dr Mei is great. He really cares about his patients. He takes time to talk to you which is rare. I've been seeing him for several years for pain management. He's also done a nerve block and epidural for me in connection with surgeries. He's very good at them and always explains what he's doing and why before he performs them. I've had to have several surgeries and I always tell my surgeons that I want Dr Mei to do the pain management after surgery. He is strict and expects you to use your medication properly but that's what a pain mgmt doctor should do. I highly recommend him!|I have been with Dr Mei for years ,he is nice so is his staff .He does want you to bring your medication so nothing in mixing together .He takes your health and pain serious.|Terrible Doctor.
He will force you to bring in every prescription you have regardless of who prescribed it and count every pill every time you have to go for another prescription.
He is very controlling and you will wait at least 3 hours to see him.
Then you go back to waiting room and wait another 30 to 45 minutes for them to get you your prescription.
Dont go to this controlling quak.
His office is old and dirty.
Paint is flaking off doors and bathroom is dirty.
Ho elsewhere for your pain. There are many new options available.
You just need to find the right doctor.
Mei is not it.|He is very kind and always willing to help in anyway he can. He has helped me very much. Would recommend him to anyone.|Simply put, Dr. Mei does not listen to patients and has zero compassion. He has an egotistical, very controlling demeanor that is condescending and demeaning, especially to senior citizen patients. Do not initial or sign his contract without reading it entirely; I'm quite sure he's pushing the boundaries of what is entirely legal. He will most assuredly protect himself and his God complex before thinking of you, the patient. Run do not walk to another doctor that will show you their kindness and compassion. Last but not least, being kept there for FOUR hours in an attempt to see and understand him is not acceptable. Don't even attempt to talk or ask him questions, you are irrelevant.",2025-02-22|2025-02-23|2025-02-21|2020-10-01|2025-02-22|2024-06-04|2025-02-21|2024-02-23,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|1,,,"10 a.m.|2 p.m.|3 p.m.",38.6|37.6|34,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Is he a good doctor and why does he he have such have such a bad bed side manner","Dr Mei is a bit quirky and is difficult to understand, but he has always been a kind and caring provider to me.

The nursing staff is wonderful now for the reason I personally left and wouldn't recommend. The clinical side has shady billing practices and the nurse practitioner only cares about racking up your bill. I chose to leave and wein myself off the pain meds because I got tired of unexplained bills and forever owing them hundreds of dollars without explanation. I can't do business like that. Again I will say Dr. Hapworth is great and the nursing staff is top notch. It's unfortunate the nurse practitioner and billing department are shady.|Dr. Hapworth took plenty of time explaining my epidural before, as well as during the procedure telling me step by step what to expect next. After the procedure, he explained what to expect in the days following. He was very pleasant and didn't try to rush through our conversation.

The rest of the staff were cheerful and helpful. It is their policy to call the day after to check on patient condition. I would not hesitate to return if another procedure is needed.|Wylie Arnett..........

Dr. Hapworth was very helpful at first.
I've had multiple epidurals over the years zero issues
I had my second T level epidural at location - went home felt a little dizzy, eyes blurry, bad headache, and my ears were ringing really loud - called surgery center they told me to lay flat.  Later was told by another Dr. possible spinal leak should have went to ER.  When I had follow up appointment with Dr. Hapworth I was telling him what all happened- like I said this had never happened before so I was concerned- he acted upset - told me the second one was under xray exactly like the first one .......told me hydrocodone can cause ringing- changed meds cut them in half ......lol.....
Guess that will teach me to keep my mouth shut .....anyway asked two pharmacists 30+ years, and two other doctors they said they've never heard that before. I think he was really trying to help me- I'm not mad, and maybe he was concerned about a lawsuit which I would never do with someone who is trying to help me .......anyway I wish him the best|Dr. Hapworth is an incredible doctor! He is very knowledgeable, kind and professional. Dr. Hapworth explained my condition in a way that was easy to understand. I had excellent outcomes with his treatment plan. I am so pleased with the  care I received from Dr. Hapworth and his amazing staff. I highly recommend Dr. Hapworth to anyone!|Dr. Hapworth is a definite asset to the medical community!! He actually sit down talked to me and explained everything he was gonna do in lamonz terms even though I didn't tell him I was A Physical Therapist and was more than understanding of what he was saying but he talked to me like A human being and we set up a game plan if the procedure I was having didn't work. Hope your lucky enough to get him if you go to the clinic. If I had to say something negative there was this nurse with long dirty blonde hair probably 50 just did not want to be there and it showed greatly, but the rest of the nurses and staff were awesome!|I was at Alabama Orthopedics for 3 years until my doctor went into another field of medicine.  I had an awful three months after that and decided to change doctors.  You can read my review on AOC, it was horrible.  Anyway, I like the facility of Pain and Rehabilitation.  Nice facility, nice doctors, quick wait times, etc...  After several appointments, I began to feel uneasy.  I was being given expensive tests with no real help.  I had been on pain medication at AOC and need it for my condition.  Dr. Hapworth said I had to go be screened by a psychologist and would base my medication decision on his prognosis.  I went and the psychologist was extremely nice.  He said he had no problem with me getting my medication and made the recommendation.  I went for an appointment yesterday and was told they would call me.  They called today and said, despite the psychologists report, it was illegal and they can not prescribe.   What they did not know was I had called the Alabama Board of Medicine and they said it was NOT illegal, but up to doctors discretion.  I began to put two and two together.  All they want is money.  I was called three times prior to all 4 appointments to bring my co-pay.  Before my injection in Pascagoula, I was called 5 times to remember my co-pay.  So, here is what they want.  They want to run a bunch of expensive tests on you but do not help.  How about being shocked (hurt like hell) for 45 minutes?  Maybe put a needle in you and run an electrical current (now this REALLY hurt)?  Make you go to Mississippi for some injections that did nothing?  Plus, they are LIARS!  So, if you want a bunch of expensive tests, harassing calls about co-pays but no help, this is the place for you!!!!  Do not waste your time, if you really want help, go find it elsewhere.|Staff is friendly and courteous.  They always have a smile on their faces and really appear to be happy at work.  Dr. Tucker is patient and thorough explaining procedures to me to ensure I understand what's about to happen.  I've been there three times for three separate procedures and every time I've been extremely pleased with the experience.|I live In Alabama  and Dr. Barfield has been doing treatment on me now I'm coming to Mississippi to do the Rf ablation. He is a fine Dr that always explains what he's going to do before hand and is very informative of what he is doing while doing the procedure.

Her son makes sure his appointments are on the same day so he can get his prescription and his mom's when they leave after the visit.

My rating is based off my review of details|I was referred to the pain clinic by a NP neurologist who said I didn't need surgery. I have been in agony with neck pain for over a year.  I made an appt and they put me with Jennifer. She set me up for shots in my neck. After the first shots I had no relief at all. At my follow up with her she said that arthritis was not causing my pain because the shots would have worked if it was. She set me up for shots two more times and no relief. When I went back to see her for follow up I was emotional from pain and not being able to sleep and asked her if they could help me.She replied by saying to me that I should be grateful because a lot of people had it worse than I did. I was shocked since she cannot begin to feel what I live with every day. I felt that was way out of line. The next day I called the office and asked to switch providers and they said it wasn't allowed so I went back one more time and she scheduled me for more shots and said I think its arthritis and this will work if it is and all I'm thinking was after the first shots she told me it wasn't arthritis. Let me say though that Dr. Menon was great and the nurses with him. I cancelled my next appt and got a second opinion at Semmes Murphy who looked at the same MRI and saw immediately that I had cervical spondylosis affecting disc levels C-4 C-5 C-6 and C-7. I don't know how the first neurologist didn't see that either.|They listened to me when I said I would rather not have medication and use physical therapy. Much appreciated as too many people receive narcotics for pain management. I say try to avoid them and work with your doctor. Thank you again.|My husband (Roger James) was seeing Jennifer McDowell and will no longer. He has dementia and is noted in his medical chart that he has to have someone with him at all appointments. Her bedside manner is horrible and should not be a nurse let alone a NP. She always makes us wait in the room for 45 minutes before she comes into the room then gone in less than 5 minutes. She kicked my husband's  service dog out of the office because of barking on Halloween when everyone was dressed up and scary. She is a piece of work.

My husband had is first injection in his back in Jackson and felt the whole thing. He does not take to Anesthesia and would be better to fully sedate him.|I love everybody in the office.

It's a place where the fusion of modern medicine and compassionate care creates a symphony of relief and recovery. This place, my friends, is the Interventional Spine & Sports Institute.

Now, I've seen my fair share of medical facilities, from the grandest hospitals to the humblest clinics, but there's something special about this institute. It's not just the cutting-edge treatments or the state-of-the-art facilities; it's the heart and soul poured into every patient's care.

I remember walking through their doors, feeling the weight of years of back pain bearing down on me. But the folks there, they greeted me with smiles as warm as a sun-drenched porch. They took the time to listen, to really listen, to the story of my pain, nodding along as if it were a gospel hymn they knew by heart.

And let me tell you about their medical cannabis certification. In a world where relief is often doled out in cold, clinical doses, they offer a path to healing that's both grounded in science and rooted in the nurturing soil of Mother Nature. They understand that sometimes, the best medicine doesn't come from a lab, but from the earth itself.

Their experts guided me through the process with the kind of expertise and kindness that's as rare as an honest mechanic. They made sure I understood every step, from the initial evaluation right down to the moment I held that certification in my hands. It was like being handed a key to a locked door I'd been leaning against for far too long.

So, if you find yourself in need of a place that combines the best of modern medicine with the timeless touch of Southern hospitality, look no further than the Interventional Spine & Sports Institute. It's more than a clinic; it's a community, a family, and a slice of heaven for those of us who've been through the wringer and come out the other side looking for a little bit of peace.

In the end, isn't that what we're all searching for? A little bit of peace, a little bit of comfort, and a whole lot of healing. Well, at the Interventional Spine & Sports Institute, that's exactly what you'll find.|Kelly really does care about her patients. Such a breath of fresh air after feeling like I had been dumped on the side of the road by my surgeons. I went in for the first visit and was blown away by the empathy shown by Kelly.

She does take veterans through community care and VA|I highly recommend Dr. Marshall  to anyone that's having severe pain. She and her staff are very professional and beautiful bedside manners. If ever I need a Dr. to treat me for my pain.  I will be running to Dr Lori Marshall.  I thank you Dr Marshall for getting me some more years of my life pain free.|Lori Marshall is an amazing doctor and cares so much for her patients! The office staff are sweet as can be and have gone above and beyond for me. They get you in and out super quick and not many doctors I know can get you in and out in 20 minutes maybe 25 at the most when they have 20 patients waiting in the waiting room alone. Lori Marshall cares so much for her patients and although she probably has a lot of patients, I know for me she gave me as much attention as I needed.|I have good and bad experiences with this clinic. The office staff is horrible and very unprofessional. When you call to make and appointment they are very rude. Her Nurse practitioners are great and the lady that does the scheduling is great. I have been going to them for 4 months now and I absolutely think she does a great deal for helping her patients with their pain care. I just wish she would help educate her staff and have them be a bit more professional and friendlier to the patients.  If you don't live in pain on a daily basis & you have no clue what it is like to be in chronic pain just ask the people who come to this clinic cause I assure you we come to Dr. Marshal because we trust in her to make our days a bit less painful. The staff should think of the level of pain the patients are in when they choose to be rude and nasty.|Dr Lori Marshall is a very Proffesional Pain Doctor My Problem is with the up front They are the Most unproffesional Group of People I have ever seen !! Let's see where do begin. They can't read nor understand Drs orders or the requests from the Dr. Such as which Dr or Nurse practitioner I'm going to see . Dr Marshall only sees patients on certain days. Then they send you home with another persons prescription . The scheduled me on Nov 18 and I get there on the 18 th the lady in the office said well your Appointment was on the 17 th. I hand her my Appt card that clearly states the18 th of Nov. she said well u can't be seen today you need to come another day.  OMG !! I called today asking was my diagnosis faxed in and put in my chart I have to have another surgery She told me I didn't know what I was talking about . So I ask her Again was any papers faxed to this office FOR ME and put in my chart She told me there was static in the phone and hung up on me.  This bunch up front is clearly a joke
I come to the Dr from well over an hour away and there's really no room for errors  I have a very long drive to see Dr Marshall. Please don't allow these uneducated and Unproffesional staff reflect on Dr Marshall and her Nurse Practitioners . The are Very Good at what they do & despite the staff she has upfront !!!|This dr is absolutely awful. The clinic and it's staff are depressing and rude. They have changed and canceled appointments on me several times. I was a patient there for 3 years and the past month the ""dr"" , ""didn't get around"" to calling in the correct medication so I went a month without. She is hardly ever present and is impossible to get in to see! I counted my blessings after the last straw. I wish I had never gone there!|Dr Marshall office is very unprofessional. They won't give you a call back when they say they will and if you keep calling they hang up the phone on you. She does not have a person that can call you if you need something I do not have acontact line. I have seen several times they sit and watch the phone ring and won't pick it up one of the saddest doctors office I ever seen. Can't get in touch with no one and when you do they lie and say they will have someone call you back|Impossible to get in touch with.... Doesn't have an answering service or after hour number.

I saw Dr Riley and he went over and beyond explaining everything to me. To the point that I cried that I finally felt seen and I now understand why I am having all of my symptoms. He spent hours with me and making sure we had the best treatment plan for the future. He wants to fix the main issue and not prescribe out the symptoms! He is amazing and I highly recommend him!|Kathy and Dr. Riley have been absolutely wonderful during my recent visits with them! They were both so kind and informative!

I can tell they genuinely care about their patients and take the time to listen and give all the information needed! 10/10 recommend for anybody looking for relief options from TMJ pain!|I had an excellent visit at MS Orofacial Pain Specialists.

His receptionist/ assistant was professional and very helpful in all aspects of the visit. Would definitely recommend this practice for your TMJ problems.|Dr. Riley takes the time to listen to you about what you may be suffering through. Both him and Kathy are kind and always make you feel heard. You are not just another patient walking through the door. Dr. Riley offers different sources of treatment and is very conservative with those options. I didn't realize how much my TMJ issues have affected me and getting treatment with him has definitely made a difference. Together we went the splint direction and Dr. Riley had spent the time to make sure that splint fit perfectly in my mouth. He truly does care that you feel better and get relief.|The first time Dr. Riley treated my TMJ was 36 years ago when I was 17-18.  After my jaw threatened to lock multiple times, he was one of the dentists that helped put my jaw popping, locking, and pain in ""remission"".  I moved away from Mississippi, and after moving back- some 20 years later- I began to have jaw problems again.  Imagine my surprise when I was looking for treatment, and found Dr. Riley!

I have been a patient again for 10+ years and he has monitored my TMJ and managed my bite splint, helping me keep the pain and popping at bay.  Dr. Riley is knowledgeable, professional, and nice!  I highly recommend him for treating TMJ.|I cannot recommend Dr. Riley enough. He is kind, knowledgeable, and passionate about the field, and that is evident in how he strives to fix the problem at hand.

I was referred to Dr Barclay's office and I was skeptical because it's two hours away from where  I live but I gave it a shot. All of the pain management doctors  my area are turning people away then they just have to suffer. I did for a year.
After seeing Dr Barclay the very first time.I was relieved. Not only is he considerate, compassionate, and concerned with your medical condition he treats his patients with the upmost respect. A BIG DIFFEENCE FROM THE PAIN DRS ON THE COAST. They treat you like you are a drug addicts when they are the ones who gets you hooked on the pain medication.. I hated going to the dr every month to be treated like POS..

I have been being seen for over 20 years  for my pain in my back and now I have Rhumatoid Arthrits so that kicked up the pain about 50 %. I just want to thank the staff for being so kind and Dr. Barclay for being a really good caring doctor who gets things done so you see good results. No other Dr had told me why I was in so much pain until I went to see Dr Barclay.  Thank you Doc.|My mother has been trying to talk with the office staff regarding a bill that she received & they have treated her horribly. Absolutely have talked to my 64 year old mother without any respect for person, patient, or customer!!!!  The office personnel are past rude and disrespectful. The issue is that the Ins company said that they used the wrong billing code & Barclay's office needs to contact them so that they can fix the codes. Obviously this offends Barclay's staff and they wouldn't even take it into consideration. These ppl need some core education & training on respect & communication skills with the public especially, when running a medical clinic!!|I fought pain every since my first back surgery. I've seen a couple Doctors in my 16 years of trying to get back some quality of life after these back surgeries. Dr Barclay is definitely the only Dr I've been to that really takes the time to listen and continues to find the right things to manage your pain. Whether it be medicine, injections, back brace or all the above he really does go the extra mile to understand and tries his best to get you a quality of life back.
I owe this Dr my life because without him I couldn't do a lot without having to stop for hours. I started coming to him and after a couple visits we not only got rid of some of the medicine my previous Dr had me on ""entirely to much"" to finding a medicine that actually worked without feeling doped up! He listened and now I can enjoy more of this thing we call life. Sure I still have some pain at times but that's expected because I don't care what anyone says if you take so much medicine all you do is sleep or sit around then that alone is no quality of life.|He convinces you to get procedures that don't not work just for you to keep getting pain medication. He done a procedure on me in April few months later I had a stroke in the same place he done the procedure. He a is Joke. Not a good at all you be in that clinic all day. Your appointment can be at 10  am you don't leave til 3 or 4. This place horrible!!|I have been going to This Pain Dr For Many Years . He is a Very Caring and Compassionate Dr. I finally got a chance after many years to explain all my complications from Pelvis Mesh and the damage it caused to me. Irreversable severe nerve damage. This made him understand what was causing my severe pain I was going through. I see one of his Nurse Practioners. She is also a Compassionate Doctor. It may take a long wait time. I Look at it like this your Doctor is taking time to listen to you. He or she is taking time to help you understand your problem.|I have suffered with chronic pain for more than half my life. Dr Barclay and his staff has been able to give me the relief I needed to continue working. I am more than grateful to him and his clinic.|Everyone is so nice and knowledgeable.

Last year my long-term physician referred me to Dr. Cole.  I have been seeing Dr. Cole and his P.A., Garrett, for several months now.  Dr. Cole revised my old treatment plan and it seems to be working well.|Dr. Cole and his NP Garrett Jones are awesome. I have been a patient for 5 years now and I will not go anywhere else. The front desk staff and the nurses are always super friendly. I have never had a single problem in the 5 years ive been a patient there.I highly recommend this clinic if you suffer from debilitating pain. Dr. Cole and NP Jones are very caring and listen to everything and create a plan that works. They have several different treatments and will work with you to find the best treatment options for your individual problems.The longest wait I've ever had there was 45 minutes. They really work hard to get you in quick and sit down every appointment and ask if the treatments are working. They accept most insurance companies. I really recommend if you are in pain to give them a try.|I am 5 months into Dr. COLE as my doctor and he has assisted me with a pain management program that has helped me to live almost pain free daily. I have multiple diagnosis that requires me to be on pain management and he genuinely cares about you. I've been to other pain doctors and their wait times and treatment make you feel worse and dread seeing them monthly. I kn ow it's getting harder to find good doctors and I'm glad I found Dr. Cole.|I've had debilitating migraines for 20 years and I have been to many, many, many doctors all over the country looking for long lasting relief. I heard about Dr Cole and decided to give him a shot since he is so close to home.

I went into this experience so full of hope. Dr Cole's treatment plans are unlike any I'd ever heard of. I was in an acute migraine situation so he admitted me to the hospital for almost two weeks. After that I stuck with Dr Cole through office location changes and through his transformation into an infusion clinic.  His Ketamine infusions were a life changer for me! My headaches improved as did my mental health and even my fibromyalgia became easier to live with.

Dr Cole is very smart and applies his knowledge to his unique treatment plans that are intended to treat you as a whole and improve your daily function. My problems with this clinic started when his clinic stopped accepting my insurance. His treatments are not cheap but I continued to see him as long as I could then I had to stop and find someone who did accept my insurance.

I had an amazing experience with his nurses Merilee, Zaffitt, and Kelli. The front desk lady was always not the most hospitable but I didn't let that bother me. I was definitely not fond of the female NP he brought in to help. I was in an acute migraine situation when I first met her. I called and asked to be worked in that day because I was hurting so bad. I was hoping for an injection to help my migraine and the nurse on the phone told me that I did not dictate whether I would get a shot or not that was up to the doctor.  I had only voiced that I needed a shot or something.  I was literally vomiting at the office. When she came in the room she was huffy and looking over my chart then wrote out my normal meds and she was done. I was stunned and told her I was there because I couldn't get control of my headache and asked her if there wasn't anything they could do that day since that was the whole reason I'd came in and she literally looked at me and said ""No there is not."" I left in tears.

I have new insurance and I've been having a horrible time with daily headaches and migraines. So I called the office and asked if they accepted my insurance and they did so I scheduled an appointment. I was very excited about possibly being pain free for a little while. I got a call from someone at the clinic telling me they cancelled my appointment because I had been dropped as a patient. I was dumbfounded because I had actually canceled my last appointment with my reason being they didn't accept my insurance and I couldn't afford to continue paying out of pocket. I tried to explain that to the lady I was talking to and she said no that Dr Cole had dropped me as a patient because I failed a drug test. I never failed a drug test and when I demanded to know when and what drug test, she said oh no, wait, that's not right. You didn't fail a drug test. Then she said she needed to call me back. She said my chart was packed away and not entered into the new system as they had just moved offices again. She calls back and says that I was dropped as a patient because I was seeing other doctors for pain treatment while I was seeing Dr Cole. I told the lady I absolutely had NOT been seeking  pain treatment from other doctors and I wanted to know who I had seen. I told her I had 4 surgeries during the time I was with Dr Cole but I had discussed those surgeries beforehand with Dr Cole and it was not an issue for him. Every time I asked her to tell me who I saw she said that info was unavailable to her BUT she WAS able to see enough to tell me I had been dropped. I also told her I had never been told there was an issue while I was seeing him.

I had written a good review on their website and had to demand they take it down. I have recommended Dr Cole to many people. I feel so very let down in a situation where I'm suffering and seeking help. Getting relief should not be so hard.|I recently visited Dr Alan Coles office where I received a prescription. I drove to multiple pharmacies and received multiple complaints about how the pharmacy doesn't fill for that provider. I found a pharmacy 5 days and 15 pharmacies later. I have been with that pharmacy since but ran into an issue where the pharmacy wouldn't be able to fill my perception till the following month. The pharmacy suggested that I ask the doctor to change the medication too something they can fill for me the same day or sooner than a month later. I then called the Dr office too see if the change could be made and was told I would get a call later that day.  I never received a call back so I followed up the next day at 8:30 a.m. and was told that the doctor agreed to the change and I would need to pick up the new prescription before they close at 12.  It takes me almost 2 hrs to get to most of my Dr offices including this particular one so when I arrived I was planning on picking up a prescription that could be filled instead I was given a nasty attitude by front desk, was told they didn't have a restroom for me to use after waiting 35 minutes, my prescription was changed too a lower dosage of the same unfillable prescription and was told to take it or my prescription will be thrown on the ground and I could get it off the ground. This has been so humiliating. I asked for workers names and titles and they told me they don't have a title and the names where Alyssa and David. I then asked for a number I can call to complain and was told that they can't give me a number and they will have someone reach out to me. This has been the worst experience ever.|I love Mississippi Pain and Migraine, especially Dr. Garrett Jones ,they are so nice and friendly and really care about their patients from the front door to the back...|I don't know how I'm posting under my grandson's name. My name is Marcia Kay McDaniel. I was a patient of Dr. Cole for years. He literally saved my life. He was the most caring kindest doctor I've ever met. He had to release me as a patient and I don't know why. I know I wasn't taking certain meds he thought I needed. I never even got them filled. I wish I could still be a patient but I'd recommend him to anyone having horrible debilitating headaches. I've had a headache for about 15 years now. Dr. Cole got it to a level that I can tolerate ok. Every once in awhile it gets bad for a day or so and I don't know I lived in that much pain.
There was one receptionist there that was hateful so I guess she's still with him. Rude and obnoxious are the nicest words I can say about that whench.|The most useless front office staff I have ever experienced in my 60+ years on this earth.

I loved him when I went in and had two shots. I was told to call back in 2 weeks if I did not have complete relief from the two shots he gave me. He told me to tell his nurse that she was to make another appointment to have him give me another shot. I called back to get an appointment and twice they left me a message I could NOT get another appointment until I had seen my Hip doctor. I was schedule for that on the 27th of March and I was going to that one, but this had nothing to do with my hip doctor. Jessica his scheduler was nasty and did not want to set an appointment, by this time I was furious because none of them would listen to what I was supposed told to do by my doctor.  After the 4th call I had it. I was NOT nice and I asked him to call me.
Again I had to make another call and when the girl answered the phone she said there was a big note on my file that they should not schedule me because no one yelled at his nurses. I was told to go somewhere else. Well, I will he is NOT the only pain doctor in Ms.
I do not understand why people who are in the business of helping someone in a lot of pain do not want to pay attention to what the patient is saying. He had two people that were rude to me the day I came in to see him the first time. One lady who sits on the front desk name Sam, made 3 other couples mad before me. I said nothing, but then when the nurse does not want to listen to me as to why I was calling, I was told to call, and I was doing what my doctor had told me to do, I am the one that suffers and I am the one that has to pay for this because there is NO compassion with the girl named Jessica and a doctor named Carroll McCleod. A phone call would have been nice when I asked him to call, but I was informed HE DOES NOT CALL HIS PATIENTS.  I AM SORRY THAT 36 YEAR S IN THE BUSINESS HAS TURNED HIM INTO STONE. I have two other doctors I use there, and I love them,
I was warned after the shots from another friend of mine whose husband was using Dr. McCleod, and his wife told me this would happen. I never would have believed this. I am really sorry, I really liked Dr. McCleod and he is a friend of my son's, it is too bad he did not know the whole story only heard the last phone call.|I have been a patient of Dr Mcleod's since 2008. He is always personable, caring and attentive during our visits. He does not make me feel like I am only a patient number. He does not rush his visits. He really wants to know how I am doing and if anything has changed since our last appointment. I have recommended him to family and friends. Dr McLeod cares about his patients. His staff is the same way. Nurse practitioner, Brian, is the same way as Dr McLeod.  He cares about the patients and never rushes through an appointment.  I thank God for Dr McLeod and his staff. He changed my life and outlook for my future from the very first visit. Before I became his patient, I could not imagine living another 40-50 years with the amount of pain I was experiencing.  He has helped me so much that I am still able to continue working full time and be an attentive wife and mother.   Dr McLeod and his staff have always wanted to help me live as close to the way I did before my car wreck.  His staff that works with him at the procedure clinic  are just as awesome. They want to make sure you are comfortable, informed and do not rush their patients. Again, a patient is NOT a number. Each patients knows when they leave the office and procedure clinic that they have been heard, examined and given the best care possible.|I am 67 years old. I saw dr. McLeod on advice of a friend.. dr. McLeod is a very personable, professional physician  in my opinion.. this staff is excellent too very nice people. Dr. McLeod did in three or four visits what another physician could not do in a year.folks I can
drop a pencil and pick it up without pain.. I can drive a car/truck 3+ hours and get out like a normal person with no pain. I put up with this pain for so long. I didn't realize how much I was hurting. Dr. McLeod fixed me.. ask my wife. I will recommend dr. McLeod and his staff to anyone with legitimate pain|I love Dr. McLeod, Brian Gates, and all of the staff. Everyone is kind, understanding, and professional. I don't like having pain and I don't like having to take medicines but I actually look forward to seeing this group on each visit. If you have to have pain these are the ones you want to go to for pain management.|I've seen Dr. Mcleod once for hope that he would take me as a patient.  Having chronic pain is not good.  So, if your case is difficult you may want to look elsewhere because I suspected he did not believe my condition.  In other words, he may have thought I was seeking drugs.  He did not know my complete history.  He only criticized my former physicians by stating he did not believe in their methods.  I've read in other reviews that his bedside manner are not up to par, well I can understand why they would state the obvious. But that is not what I was looking for in as a Pain Specialist. I understand Pain Doctors are high risk to lose their license, drug abuse complaints and the other.  I just feel he should have asked for more information before giving me an over-the-counter diagnosis.|Almost a year later he's still my doctor. 5 days now since my last visit I'm painless folks maybe not 100% but 99% is good enough for me. I can't say enough for Dr McLeod I appreciate his effort I can drive a car now without getting out every 15 miles to to get the pain out of my legs pick up a pencil when you drop it without pain. It's the little things I can do that I really like it's so different. I would like to leave a little praise for one of his staff members name is Nathan. I must have looked spooked on my visit cuz Nathan did all he could to assure me everything is going to be ok. I gave Nathan the inopportunity to answer a couple  questions about drugs that he was administering to me. He.jumped on those questions with both feet answered them thoroughly. He sounded a lot like some of my professors in pharmacy school. Nathan had his moment in the Sun but it's not just Nathan it's all of the staff they welcome you with a smile and they depart you with a smile. We'll see you guys in about 3 weeks|Dr. McCleod has been such a blessing to me in helping me overcome my pain from SI joint and bursitis. He's compassionate and understanding, and he will do anything to make sure that his patients are comfortable. I highly recommend Dr. McCleod!|We were supposed to be referred to a surgeon for a procedure for compression fracture never heard from anyone for 3 weeks I called office and no one returned my can after we scheduled with another surgeon we got a call from surgeon they had not been able to get in touch with them either! In meantime fracture got worse due to the waiting and trips back and forth in pain. So sad for an 80 year old that has worked their entire life to be treated like oh you're old we can help you.

He is very knowledgeable as well as compassionate!! My husband recently went to him for lower back pain and neuropathy. He had been to a couple of drs and a couple of more scheduled to be seen. He has not had anyone explain to him what was going on nor given the treatment he needed. Dr. Sitzman assessed his conditions, explained in detail and presented a plan of action. We will be forever grateful!! He is an amazing physician and a caring man!|Dr. Sitzman is the bomb!  He is a GREAT physician and I can truly say that he really cares about his patients. I have been seeing him for about 6 - 7 years now and my pain has greatly diminished.  I would recommend him to anyone.|Dr. Sitzman and his staff are great. Hip, back, neck, shoulder... he has treated me for these and probably more I don't remember. Very, very good doctor. Pain MANAGEMENT - I've had great outcomes with him.|Dr. Sitzman is wonderful. I feel cared for and respected by him and his great staff. My life is good and I'm able to work despite health issues. I'm so very blessed to be under his care.|Dr. Sitzman is the greatest example of what a doctor should be. He is dedicated to his patients. On a personal note on March 25 1997 my world was devastated in an instant. An 18 wheeler hit my geo tracker and kept on going however this caused me to hit a tree at 70 mph head on. I was told that I would never walk work or have kids. After countless days of surgeries and therapy I went back to work as a fulltime nurse still having to have occasional surgeries and therapy you can imagine how much pain I would have on a daily basis I would have so in 2003 I was referred to Dr sitzman  the first time I saw him I informed him that I was a nurse and this was important to me.  So he has worked with me and my pain. He would work me in on short notice whenever I would have a flare up with me pain. Some of those flare ups would have me in so much pain and he would work his magic on me. So now I have been doing my passion in life as a fulltime pediatric nephrology nurse at ummc children's hospital in Jackson ms.  There is not enough thanks in the world I can say about him  I know that he is the best if you ask me|If you are ready to make an appointment with a uncaring, condescending narcissist, that's what will be waiting for you at advanced pain therapy, Dr. Sitzman is a sociopath with a god complex. He takes responsibility for nothing. And puts certain patients last. If you have any kind of intelligence he is not the doctor for you!|Dr. Todd Sitzman is an anesthesiologist with advanced training in pain management and over 25 years of experience. He is compassionate and provides comprehensive holistic patient assessments. I've been a patient of Dr. Sitzman for 8 years. His fees are reflective of clinical standards/laws driven by Medicare, Medicaid regulations. All patients fees are standard and not unique to the payor source. I've heard Dr. Sitzman tell family members of patient's with a terminal illness and complex pain to call him anytime day or night if their loved one's pain was uncontrolled. I've watch an elderly patient with bone cancer come into the clinic crying due to pain from a fractured him that was inoperable. Dr. Sitzman responded to the family's urgent request for intervention. Within a short time this elderly man was telling jokes and smiling. He takes extra time with elderly patients, veterans, and any one that is vulnerable.

Take time to research his credentials:                                                                           ""He is an active member of numerous national and international pain societies: president of North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS); past president of American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), Southern Pain Society (SPS), Mississippi Pain Society (MPS) and Mississippi Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. He is the recipient of AAPM's Distinguished Service Award in 2012. He has authored more than 75 scientific publications including abstracts, manuscripts, and book chapters, and serves on the editorial boards of the journals Pain Medicine and Pain Practice. He is actively involved in patient advocacy and postgraduate medical education, and lectures nationally and internationally on topics related to pain pharmacology and interventional pain therapies.""

Pain is complex and requires a physician with special training in evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of all different types of pain. Pain is actually a wide spectrum of disorders including acute pain, chronic pain and cancer pain and sometimes a combination of these. Pain can also arise for many different reasons such as surgery, injury, nerve damage, and metabolic problems such as diabetes. Occasionally, pain can even be the problem all by itself, without any obvious cause at all.

As the field of medicine learns more about the complexities of pain, it has become more important to have physicians with specialized knowledge and skills to treat these conditions.

Dr. Sitzman has an in-depth knowledge of the physiology of pain, the ability to evaluate patients with complicated pain problems, understanding of specialized tests for diagnosing painful conditions, appropriate prescribing of medications to varying pain problems, and skills to perform procedures (such as nerve blocks, spinal injections and other interventional techniques) are all part of what a pain management clinician uses to treat pain. He is one unique and talented physician I'm thrilled to have as part of my pain management team!|Dr. Sitzman, is the greatest, I've been seeing him for my hip for several years now and he does a fantastic job, he is very professional, and very passionate at what he does, thank you doc, your the best",2022-02-20|2020-01-09|2022-04-07|2019-06-27|2019-12-08|2021-07-04|2019-01-28|2018-10-05,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|experienced_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJLRwjFschnYgR6MPHTw4iiF0,22

At first things were going well. When I went in to establish care with Dr. Burns, I arrived about a hour and a half early. I was able to be seen right away and the staff were very nice. I was greeted by Dr. Burns with a big hello.  However, as soon as he read over my chart things went off the deep end; fast. The very first thing he said to me was ""You have four children. That's four too many...(pause)(silence) if you ask me."", in a serious tone of voice. Four too many? ....If I ask you? Quick side note; He does not know anything about my martial/relationship status(which really should not matter), financial stability, or physical ability to take care of or give birth to a child. Also, take note that I'm not an extremely young person. Next year I will be 30. My question is why? If I didn't know any better I would say that he's racist and believes that black children should not be brought into this world. ""Why?"", would have been a good question to ask right then and there.  Later during the appointment.  He asks if I wanted anymore children. I reply, yes.  He then asks, "" Can I talk you out of it? "" This time I did ask him why and he tells me ""because they add stress."" I hadn't complained of being stressed at all. Additionally, I was not even treated for the main reason of the visit. He shrugged off my concern as nothing to worry about. Well , my condition got worst.  Way worst.

Davene Wells took over care for me at midsouth pain clinic. My old doctor which was Dr.Garrett left and she replaced him. Her attitude was and is HORRIBLE!!! She try to talk to folks like they are incompetent and like they don't understand English! Each time I saw her which was 3 times she seemed to always be mad and aggressive and going to a place where you're already going through things is just unacceptable. You should not be in a field where you have to deal with people everyday and clearly she doesn't like people. I would not recommend her to NO ONE! Each time you see her it's always over an hour wait! Highly not recommended|The staff and doctor was very nice. I gave it 2 stars because I have been hurting for days and they haven't sent my prescription in yet. I have called and left messages not one return phone call. Other than that the doctor and his NP is great bedside manners and the staff was nice.|The staff was nice and friendly with the exception of one. She was loud,rude, and talked to patients in a rude like tone. She was the only one that acted that way.  Also it's been 3 weeks almost 4 and they never called my pain script in for my back. I had to take a urine test and I understand they have to send it off to a lab due to not having one on site. I called and left a message for Chris nurse. She returned my calls but this last time I never heard back from anyone. I'm seriously thinking about finding another location or a different treatment center. I have missed 3 days of work due to being in so much pain.

Dr. Deaver was attentive and had some really good ideas about a plan of treatment for me.   He listened and answered all my questions.  The RN in the office with him was also very knowledgeable and kind!  Everyone from the front desk back was friendly and kind.   Being a nurse myself, that is all very important to me in an office setting.   I certainly appreciated them all.|I was met with respect and extreme concern for my health. The staff was caring and friendly and explained everything with detail and patience. I felt very safe and welcomed by the health care team in this clinic. I would highly recommend this team to anyone who suffers with chronic pain. This team is truly here to help you.|I was referred to this clinic, never got to my first initially appointment. The clinic called 15 minutes to my appointment time to tell me my appointment was canceled. I was already standing outside their clinic doors to read a sign that said we are closed and sorry for the inconvenience. All over a winter storm that eveyone knew was coming into the area long before that thursday morning.|When everybody told me I needed surgery and told me I didn't have a chance without it at 25 years old , Dr Terry got me in the next day for a procedure after not being able to walk for 2 months and I was able to walk out of the building right  after the procedure unassisted. I feel great and my quality of life is improving. And my pain is little to none Very thankful for a fighting chance.|Dr Deaver did not care at all about me, nor would care to work with my Neurologist to figure out what is best. He just decided that he didn't understand my functional movement disorder with functioning seizures so he wouldn't help me. I mean what happened to the days of doctors trying and caring? Just because you may have to work a little bit harder and communicate with another doctor you just give up? Why even be a doctor if you can't even bother to care about a patient?|I will have to say my recent visits and nerve block shots have helped. Nothing will take away all the pain but the relieve I get from the shots help out tremendously.  I sometimes wish I didn't have the work on me everyday then I wouldn't feel as much of the pain, but my life and my body says I can't just sit down and do nothing. There is to much to do in my life. I do appreciate all that they have done for me.|The appointment was for my wife. But I will leave a review as I had asked them to stop texting me but yet they sent another message with a different number.  My wife had her first appointment yesterday. It did not go well at all. They did not have courtesy to tell us her medical records had not come in yet. She has severe PTSD at doctors' offices from another doctor. Any way she had to wait for hours at the office to be called back then wait some more then to be taken into the office of DR. Deaver. Now Instead of telling her that her medical records had not came in like he should have he had her explain why she was there, just to look at her like she was lying and faking her illness. He even told her he did not believe her that the neurologist agreed she should go to pain management for her condition.  He was cruel to my wife by making her go through the whole thing to then tell her he can't help her. If we would have known her records from her main physician and the neurologist were not in yet we could have had at least two hours to call while we were waiting! We had no idea. And my poor sick wife whom woke up already sick with a migraine and throwing up before we left felt betrayed and mocked by Dr. Deaver. And now she has to wait 3 more excruciating weeks before he will see her again even if he gets her records early. And it takes even longer to find somewhere else so she is stuck with someone who now has a bad opinion of her as she was extremely sick when she went in and she gets emotional plus all the stress they cause her.|Ashley has always been nice to me.

They not only lied to me but wouldn't even give me a NSAID injection much less something that actually works. I'm a good honest person that has been suffering for a long time with metal plates and screws and surgeons telling me it shouldn't hurt anymore when they don't have any experience with metal plates and screws in their bones or they would feel different about pain killers. No one can tell Another person how much pain they are in cuz they can't possibly know, that surgeon hit a nerve in my shoulder and my whole arm is useless and I left a bad but honest review bout him so I'm sure he called y'all telling ya bunch of crap when the truth is less than a month after surgery he wouldn't tell the insurance company why I even needed my meds when they kept rejecting them. I don't wanna drink and I've only drank twice in the past year and both times it was cuz I couldn't even get around cuz the pain is dabilatating & it's 24/7. Rubi at Mercy with a bone sticking out of my shouldergsve me a bunch of crap for anxiety and wouldn't even give me a Tylenol 3, with a bone literally sticking out of my shoulder and told me Preston jones the Ortho surgeon in the bluff wouldn't even write me a prescription either so I went around him and he sent me a bill in the mail, before I left that appointment he said 'Now you ain't gotta come back"" and looked at me real hard. Alot of ppl don't like me fore some reason, people even burnt my house down that my Mother left me recently, all I wanted was a good honest, kind, & caring Dr to see through whatever junk they been told and find out for theirs what kind of a oerson I am, but unfortunately that didn't happen, he had his mind made up when he walked in the room for the Apt. With over a dozen broken bones and disc disease the new Dr told me he didn't know who got me started on the pain meds but it was ridiculous and in my opinion not giving someone as messed up from head to toe as me is pure negligence & wrong morally. I just need someone to stick up for me & help me, I'm truly suffering and am still willing to try Anything I don't just want pain medicine but it's just all that has given me relief so far, is pain killers for pain., God bless & Sincerely, -Wesley Smith|Dr Roberts was caring and direct. He ordered an MRI and physical therapy and set up a follow up appointment to further assess the problem.|Doctor Roberts is great. He's excellent at explaining, asking your opinion, do u have a question.  His assistant McKenzie if fabulous as well.  I will miss Doctor Roberts when he goes to his new position. I will miss you.  Kim|Knee injections are not fun and they are painful. Not significantly but they are. However, I think that I had a nice distraction talking with my physician. There was minimal setup, just sitting in my chair and no special hospital draping or equipment. In and out. Efficient. My experiences have always been good but this was especially stress free.|So glad Dr Roberts has returned to OHC. He is excellent and caring. I trust his judgement. And McKenna,  Vanessa, and Montana are exceptional in their care of veterans. Thank you all.|Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I liked it there and look forward to my next visit.|If I could give less than 1 star, I would.

My wife went in with severe back pain. The options given were physical therapy, a shot, or surgery. She decided to try therapy first. The physical therapy did not work.

So, she had a follow-up appointment already scheduled. She called beforehand to ensure she would get the shot, and the receptionist said yes, no problem.

Her appointment was with Dr. Caron, who we then found did not do shots, so the receptionist either lied or had no clue. She had to make an appointment with Dr. Roberts and waited over a month to see him. Mind you, she is in pain almost constantly.

She was so looking forward to some pain relief.

On the day of her long-awaited appointment, we showed up to find Dr. Roberts was not in. Instead of scheduling her for the next day, they rescheduled her for another month and a half later. It was not her fault Dr. Roberts was not there as he was supposed to be? Why should she have to suffer another 1.5 months?

Why didn't they call to tell us about the cancelation? Then we would not have wasted time and gas.

We are going to a pain management center in Springfield, where we hope they care for their patients.

The problem we had with Ozarks Healthcare was only with pain management.  We haven't had problems in other departments, at least so far.|I liked Dr. Roberts a lot as he was a very competent doctor, and did a good job.
However when I went to my last appointment which was a follow up & a pre visit to get on the schedule to have another shot put in my back, I was suddenly and without any warning told I couldn't get on the schedule because in two days time Dr. Roberts was leaving the clinic.
While I wish him well in his future endeavors, I also firmly believe that any Doctor who is planning to leave the place they are currently practicing at should send out a letter/notice to their patients well in advance of their departure from the clinic, or at least have their office/company send out a letter/notice well in advance of their departure so that a patient like me will have a heads up in advance giving me a chance to find another provider, and get on their schedule to continue treatment without interruption instead of having me show up for a regularly scheduled follow up visit for treatment just to be told I can't get on the schedule to have another shot in my back like I need continue treatment because the doc won't be there in two days time.",2025-02-20|2025-01-31|2024-05-21|2024-04-18|2024-02-16|2025-02-15|2023-10-13|2017-09-14,1|5|5|5|5|5|1|1,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",87.8|82.6|75.6,"Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Iam hurting so bad I have bad arthritis I can't walk knees need replacement diabetic CHF  and cold.

Both the old and new locations. The staff and Doc Sturm have always treated me with kindness, respect, and understanding. Last year I did a Drip and decided to do it again this year. As a treat to myself.
They make a world of difference! I have done both in December, the immune boost. I add B12 & Toradol. Makes the season perfect. Now they have a monthly subscription and I am super hyped.
IF you want to feel better. If you want to be a person and not a number. This office IS your last stop!|This is a response to James Mitchell's review from today 1/13/2025, and high compliments on Arch Pain Management's busness.

I was in the office when Mr Mitchell was there discussing his issue at the office of Dr. Sturm today, and heard much of the exchange.

I've been a patient of Dr. Sturm for several years, as has a friend of mine, and we have the high respect and regard for Dr. Sturm and his amazing staff.  They have always treated us with wisdom, respect and wonderful kindness.

Dr. Sturm's staff discussed their policies and probably state and federal laws clearly and politely with Mr. Mitchell.  If he spends time living in both Illinois and Missouri as his review stated, which are neighboring states, then surely he can find the service he wants in Illinois where he mentioned that he holds a drivers license.

Dr. Sturm provides excellent,  high quality service to the local community in a field that can't be easy to navigate.  He's always up on the latest related information, and spends quality time with each patient.  We've never had to wait long at all, and every member of the staff is polite, engaging, fun and respectful.  Thank you to Dr. Sturm and all your staff for all that you do!  God Bless!|*RESPONSE TO THEIR RESPONSE* Lets say I'm not getting the full story. Why didn't she get the polite option to reschedule? Why did you call her husband who wasn't even there and abandon him as a patient when he is a completely different patient and case? No matter how you spin it, what you guys did and more importantly how you handled it was unethical.*
My mother was completely disrespected here. I read her review and the offices response below and their response was a joke. They said she put everyone at risk over a ""just a med refill"". Excuse me, being a pain management center, they should know what a big deal that is for some people! She had COVID for almost 2 full weeks and told them ""she was at the end of it"" when  she was actually feeling much better with no symptoms. So maybe poor wording on her part but she was being honest and still went to her appointment WEARING A MASK. (thinking that was the right thing to do) She wasn't careless or trying to harm anyone like they make it seem in their review response. So are they saying masks don't work? Something doctors strongly believe in?...they sternly told her she could kill someone and needed to go outside and call them back. Didn't ask her any follow up questions, just berated her (I'm not saying yelled but BERATED) for coming in and sent her outside. She wasn't being belligerent or anything. They then told her ""she wasn't the right fit"" and ended her care right then which left her crying in the parking lot confused on what just happened and shocked. The PROFESSIONAL thing to do would've been to simply and POLITELY reschedule her appointment a couple weeks later and explain the seriousness of their guidelines moving forward. They also called her husband who was not even there and completely unrelated to this situation and canceled him as a patient too for ""not being a good fit"" as well. My mother has mental health issues, diabetes, and severe fibromyalgia and finding a pain doctor is a stressful task in itself to be abandoned as a patient just like that...without the doctor calling either her or her husband to explain further or apologize. My mom isn't the easiest person but she's not a mean person and was treated so horrible. For what?! She could've called for a temporary refill, yes, but she felt much better and it had been almost 2 weeks! And still wore a mask! She didn't think it would be a big issue. I work at a doctors office myself and I can say that that was handled completely wrong and unprofessional. When she told me, my jaw dropped. Because of this, my mom is left without pain meds that her body has been accustomed to for years and now trying to get in somewhere asap is hard with appointments booking so far out. She is crying daily from the stress this has caused and the pain she is in. Seems this place didn't want to deal with a certain type of patient and abandoned her and her husband (again, he wasn't even there). This could've been handled so differently. This IS patient abandonment and is causing her mental and physical distress. I'm trying to convince them to speak with an attorney.|I arrived for my appointment. i was told they could not accept me because i have an Indiana drivers license. We have residences in both states because of grandkids. I go to VA Columbia where  am prescribed narcotics. I was told i had to have an Missouri drivers license regardless where i lived. They then told me he could not perscribe narcotics for me. I didnt want them. My take away is this place is a big narcotics perscribing doctor. If you want them go see this doctor. Bad people.|Dr Sturm has been my pain doctor for a few years and he is by far along with his staff extremely polite, very professional and very knowledgeable. It wasn't for them I really don't know where I would be in life. Thanks Doc and staff.

I am going to have to add on to my post. I was reading about how some of the reviewers on here were accusing the doctor and staff of being racist. Personally that is a bunch of bull if you are abusing your prescription they have every right in the world to no longer have to have you as a patient. That's your fault. Wants your name gets out there as an abuser of your prescription you might as well just hang it up because no one's going to see you. That's all on you deal with it. It's not because you're a person of color it's because you possibly decided to sell your prescription to make money. Karma's a bi*+@.|We love dr sturm and his team.  My husband had a heart attack and needed pain meds and Justin has been a huge help.  We had problems with getting meds before but Justin steps up and gets them ordered for us.  We highly recommend this place for anyone who needs pain management.|I've been seeing Dr.Sturm for maybe 3 yrs.Ive never had a problem with him,he's always treated me right until last month. He let some of his office team harrass me.So I walked in there for my appointment and I had a mask on because I had covid I immediately told the head girl in there why I was wearing it.She told me very rudely that I needed to leave go to my car and call her.I did she answered heard it was me, and started yelling at me.Then handed the phone to the bigger guy that works in there too and he treated me the same, like they didn't even know me I always got along with them.He said that they all decided I wasn't a good fit for that office know more.That was after I said that when the doctor wasn't busy that I want to talk to him, basically to see if he agreed to me not coming back.They said doctor told them he didn't want me me back.Soo..anyways I sat in my car outside for about 30 min crying, I trusted these people and they turned on me for walking in with a mask on because of covid. I believed I was doing the right thing and they threw me out.It really hurt me because I liked Dr.Sturm and the rest of the crew and they all thought I wasn't a good fit for them hmm.I would never intentionally do something to put anyone in danger thats why I wore the mask.   SB|The doctor was rude, and late every for every appointment. He never examined the patient even after 5 visits. He wrongfully accused her of using illicit drugs even after she took a drug test for them and passed. I would not recommend this place to anyone even people who are seeking a strictly cannabis based treatment.",2024-12-29|2025-01-13|2025-01-04|2025-01-13|2020-10-22|2024-12-05|2024-12-03|2024-10-30,5|5|1|2|5|5|3|1,,,,,"Language assistance, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking","What Insurances do you not take?","Hi here is a list of all the Insurances we do NOT take here: https://stlouispainmanagement.com/faq/

As I read through the previous reviews, it's to bad ""we"" the patients cannot begin an ""open blog"". I have been rescheduled and rescheduled and rescheduled. The first ""family emergency, Doctor Brown, if there is a Dr. Brown the receptionist desk? Gave me a 30 minute notice before my appointment Dr. Brown has been whisked away by a family emergency. My re-scheduled, rescheduled appointment was rescheduled because Dr. Brown has been yet again engaged in a continuing ""Family Emergency"". I am now on my 3 rescheduled ... scheduled appointment. The staff is ridiculous and I really don't think they know anything about anything. It's getting EXHAUSTING and EXTREMELY-
REPETITIVE, over and over. If I could leave a NEGATIVE 5 Star or worse I would. So, if you are considering using this Pain Management Institute, be ready for a REALLY BIG frustrating experience. I am still awaiting for my next reschedule appointment with Dr. Brown, I am currently going on 3 months out . I will be the first to give kudos, I really think it's worth the time to acknowledge good work , performance, ethics especially in the hardworking of the caregivers in hospitals and clinics in this state of Missouri. These professionals truly give it all. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR Anything close to professional, YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE WRONG solution for your pain. All you are going to get is MORE PAIN and MORE. Jumping around with this pain institute.
One more note Dr. Oliver, the one doctor who helped me was kind and did his best to help me with ONE of my pain debilitating nerves in my spine. This was one week ago I had this procedure.
So, while still waiting for Doctor Brown , the only orthopedic doctor , really??? To return from his never ending family emergency, maybe, just maybe, I can get my shoulder cuff repaired? Who knows. Can you report an incompetent group - staff? If so please let me know.
MY ADVICE go somewhere else.
Thank you Dr. Oliver for your part of my recovery.
Susan Raftery|If I could give zero stars, I would. The office staff is rude, unprofessional, and completely disorganized. Communication is abysmal--no one seems to know what anyone else is doing. My elderly father pays in cash, but they refuse to issue receipts, claiming payments are ""immediately entered into the system,"" which is hard to believe given the constant confusion.

One day, I was told insurance would cover everything; the next, they demanded $250. When I asked for clarity, the billing staff dismissed my concerns, accusing me of lying because ""the person responsible has been out all week."" This type of treatment is sadly the norm.

After nearly a year of dealing with both the Chesterfield and Troy offices, we've experienced nothing but frustration. My father has followed every instruction to try a device recommended in August, yet it's now January, and we're still waiting. Despite completing every requirement--and more--the process feels like an endless loop of repeated visits and excuses.

Dr. Whitlow, in particular, is unprofessional and avoids even basic responsibilities. He hasn't performed physical exams during my father's last three visits, nor has he reviewed critical information before appointments. How can proper care be provided without preparation or communication?

This clinic is a disorganized mess. The lack of professionalism, accountability, and basic respect for patients is unacceptable. I will be filing a formal complaint with Mercy's governing board.|Dr. Oliver is amazing!! With chronic pain and spine issues, I've come to realize that needles and uncomfortable procedures are a necessary part of my life. Dr. Oliver's technique and bedside manner make the process of getting various injections much less scary. He's extremely kind, knowledgeable, skilled, attentive, and empathetic. I never feel rushed and he's always willing to answer any and all questions I have.  He's one of the first doctors who truly listened to me and believed me without skepticism or judgement when I described the debilitating pain I've been living with. Most importantly, he offers effective treatments for my pain. The relief he has been able to provide is life changing!!|Dr.gheith and his staff are remarkable people. I would not hesitate to send my mother to him...in fact I have. I went in for leg pain and weakness. He thoroughly reviewed my mri's, he noticed a couple artifacts that were in related to my leg pain and got me set up with the appropriate physicians to address these concerns. He could've said not my problem but he brought to my attention and now i feel confident I'm getting ahead of possible future issues.|I was very impressed with Dr. Oliver who I saw at IPI.  He was the first doctor that explained why I was suffering.   He showed my son and I on a spine model and spinal photo where exactly the pain is coming from and what was going on.  I was so relieved after seeing many doctors to finally be able to understand what is going on with me.  He spent well over an hour with me and we discussed further options for my pain relief.   The staff was great, very kind and when I called afterward and left a message they got back to me within minutes.   I would highly recommend this place.|After waiting a long time for Dr Geith to come in the room he tells my husband that he had a heart murmur and atrophied in his legs. Then he wants my husband to go to 3 different doctors he recommended before he does the mild procedure for his spinal stenosis. We walked out!
First of all; my husband pays for a primary care doctor to be at his service. This doctor was his mother's doctor as well. He went to him and told him what Dr Gieth said. His primary doc told him that he didn't have a heart murmur nor atrophied in his legs. His doctor checked him again and said the same thing. Dr Geith must get a kick back for making people go to other doctors. But I just don't understand why he lied to us. I do not trust him!!|I was told that Dr Gheith treated his mother for CRPS and that he created his own method of treating it, I was also told ""Not to toot our own horn but we are highly sought after in the nation for CRPS"". When I saw Dr. Gheith he said I had only two options, nerve block or spinal cord stiumulator. There's nothing unique about these options and I didn't get the impression from him that any of this was true. I'm concerned because I have a procedure scheduled and I just don't know why they were so persistent about getting me in. Looking at other reviews to see other's experiences. I also was left in the waiting room for a very long time.|Staff is not connecting well with the doctors or patients. Staff said they never received my MRI results which they had and I contacted imaging center to send it again. I know they received them the 1st time bc on my next visit the Dr asked me if the staff contacted me with the results which they had not. Appointments should be spread farther apart to reduce waiting time.  I never received my paperwork via snail mail and it's  extension and should be made available online. Dr should discuss the main side effects. I'm giving 4 stars bc I like my doctor.",2025-02-10|2025-01-14|2024-12-07|2025-01-23|2024-11-16|2025-01-25|2024-12-27|2024-12-12,1|1|5|5|5|1|3|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJX02qFTIr34cRPoG04-p-JHI,158

It's been 3 weeks now and no one has returned my call. Unbelievable. I moved on to Cox Health.|I was scheduled for a second procedure a few days ago. My appointment was scheduled for after 4pm. I was given the calming pill and hadn't sat for very long when the nurse/tech came back to bring me to the procedure table. My anxiety was high because the pill had not taken effect yet and I knew the previous procedure was painful. I asked if we could wait a few more minutes for the pill to start working and she told me it's ""really late in the day"" and they could just proceed with the (painful) procedure or reschedule me. I opted for the rescheduling of course. The pill finally took effect about ten more minutes later after i got home. I then received a letter from the doctor in the mail a few days later dropping me as a patient without explanation of reason. I feel there is serious lacking of bedside manner and compassion for me and I've a feeling I'm not the only one. I hope enough feedback will bring some awareness and accountability within the clinic's team.|I have gone here for years with great success. The staff is top-notch! They are kind, polite, and show an interest in not only your progress but also in you on a personal level. I live with chronic pain but thanks to them it is very minimal!|The only thing they care about is making sure you don't take opioids. They don't care if you actually have pain or not. They got me hooked on Suboxone and I couldn't take it because of anxiety. They don't care. Good luck if you have to go here!|Update;  Elite pain Management  gets a Minus 10 Star. This Place Should be Shut Down.
Girlfriend was going to Elite Pain Mangement for pain management.  They were giving her injections in her lower back. She complained to them for months about the pain in the top middle of her back and all they would say,  is we'll get to your top back when we're done working on your bottom back. Well because they didn't listen to they patient, my girlfriend had to be rush to the emergency room
where they did emergency surgery the next morning. She  has stage 4 cancer. No one would listen to her. She almost died that weekend. She doesn't go to Elite Pain Management anymore. She is now deceased. Maybe if someone listened to her, she might be still alive today.
Old review,  First, long red hair receiptionest is got to be the most rudest disrespectful person I've ever met. And to top it off she tries to make you think your the rude person. Second, I was referred to Elite by Cox. Cox said I didn't need surgery so sent me to Elite. Elite said I need surgery and wanted to send me back to Cox. Neither place knows what they are doing. Both places have received a 1 star each for being so incompetent and not turthly caring for their patients. I am now being properly cared for and treated by Mercy. Oh and because of Elite and Cox incompetence, I've been bed ridden 3 1/2 to 4 months in massive pain. And they are very lousy at keeping appointments. Went for my designated appointment and they are so behind they screwed up the rest of my day. Every surprised they have a total 3 star review Also they don't keep their appointment time. Here with other patient as their driver  and they're running over a hour late. Now I change my review from a 1 star to a minus 1.5 star.|Dr. Tonkin and his staff are very professional, caring and respectful! Dr. Tonkin gave me an injection last week so much pain relief, it kept me out of pain till my shoulder surgery which was yesterday. The ppl leaving bad reviews needs JESUS  Dr Tonkin and staff have helped me more than my old pain doctor! So if you need relief see the Best Elite Pain Management Dr. Tonkin and staff YOU ROCK!VERY PLEASED AND SATISFIED! THANK YOU  MAGGIE|BEWARE!!!One of the worst experiences I've had ever in my life at age 48. YOU MUST READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE seeing Dr. Tomkins and learn how about his practice of treating people! It's absolutely awful and it happened to me as well!

I regret not reading other's reviews before seeing him. My wife and I not one, but many bad experiences going there.

Our impression was Dr. Tonkin thinks he is way too important to stop by check on you and see how your progress is coming along like a true professional caring doctor would do. He outsources to his assistants to assess the situation. He showed my wife and I repeatedly he didn't care at all about us. Just our wallets of course! They love to take your money and charge you handsomely for every little thing they can.

They will waste so much of your time! Upfront summary for example -  we had 1pm appointment for a 20 minute visit with a ""physician assistant"" (not Dr. Tonkin) and we left at 6pm.

At Elite Pain Management for every doctor appointment we had, we had very long wait times before seeing a physician.  One afternoon we had a 1pm appointment. We had sold a home and had a closing at 4:30 pm. After waiting to see a physician,  the actual appointment only last 15-20 minutes, so getting in and out for a 4:30 closing should not have been a problem right? WRONG! We told them several times we needed to be done so we could make this closing at 4:30. They kept telling us OK no problem. We waited until almost 5pm before being seen and we had to reschedule the closing. Every appointment we had was similar to this. You wait and wait and they waste so much of your time!  Literally you'll spend HOURS....not minutes, but hours way past your appointment time to get in for a 10 minute visit with Dr. TONKINS' assistant and on a rare occasion Dr. Tonkins.

OUR FINAL AND WORST EXPERIENCE: We had many terrible experiences there, but this one was our last.

So here's what happened for my last visit there and the last time being their patient/client. I had a nerve ablation scheduled, after waiting for a period of time as usual, it was finally my turn. They got me prepped and ready on the surgical table, but then things went sideways fast. As I was prepped and ready to go by the staff,  Dr. Tonkins was in the other room making small talk.  I had asked 2 different staff members if I could speak with Dr. Tonkin before he performed the nerve ablation. They kept telling me he was busy with another patient, so I waited laying face down on the surgical table with level 9-10 pain. My SI Joint was throbbing and it hurt really bad to stay there in that position, but I had no choice.

Laying there face down and listening to Dr. Tonkin make small talk/flirting/joking around in the next room for over 15 minutes, my pain kept increasing getting worse and worse. The pain was getting so high I was starting feel nauseous. Now I was worried I was going to throw up all over the floor.  On top of that, I was also feeling nervous and uneasy about Dr. Tomkins doing a painful ablation on the WRONG side, but according to the staff, he insisted it was going to be done on the LEFT side not the right side. That didn't make any sense to me. I wanted to have a discussion about the procedure and get an explanation why he refused to work on the right side where it hurt so bad. If he had a good reason that would put me at ease about the procedure, that would have been great, but that never happened.

What happened next is unbelievable! Again, laying there in terrible pain and feeling sick,  I cried out to him for help so he could hear me from the other room. Dr. Tonkin came into the room and shouted out in anger....""YOU'RE DONE"" and prematurely ended the procedure and then sent me a letter weeks later dropping me as a client. All because I asked to speak to him about my legitimate concerns I had as a patient of his.

I found Dr. Tonkins to be defensive, egotistical, he doesn't communicate with his patients and is quick to anger. If you ask him questions, he may get angry and ask you to leave and drop you as a client.|To any future patients that wish to attend this facility. There's gotta be a reason why their reviews are only at a 2.9. Could it be that they are making people take morning appointments? I just called and scheduled an appointment with another pain. Clinic that specifically asked me what day and what time can I make this appointment?  Imagine that and I was told today whenever they called me  and fire me as a patient that every Doctor's office tells you that you don't have the option of scheduling in the PM or AM. Well, I just called another pain clinic. And I was asked what time can I come in for this appointment. So if you all are looking for a place For pain management and you can't make morning appointments.Then my suggestion is find another pain clinic.I had been coming to this pain clinic for 4 years.I had nothing but good things to say about the staff.I was still fired because I can't make morning appointments. And by all means, do not voice your opinion about any rules that they make up throughout the year. That's not within your contract. By all means, do not speak up on your own behalf. Because then you will be accused of being rude. The nurses will collab together. Make up ignorant stuff to tell Doctor tonklin.  And he will fire you because of what they say. Because if Doctor Tomlin would have listened to the phone call between me and those nurses? Yeah, he would hear that. I was excited and upset but he wasn't going to hear me being rude to them. Ladies because I was throwing compliments to the ladies this this place is a cash cow that's all this places.  Whenever this new building comes out, that's whenever they started making other appointments. Like these annual wellness Check up. Aint that something that you do at your primary care Doctor I mean, if you're going to the pain management facility for your pain, because the primary care Doctor can't prescribe can't prescribe opiates. Why would you be made to go to an annual wellness Check up at a pain clinic if you got a primary care provider. This is them scheduling numerous appointments to make money. Numerous appointments that are not needed and I think that's another reason why I was let go because I questioned all of these appointments.  I mean I was going to 1 appointment per month and now they come up with other reasons to schedule patients for other appointments. No wonder your reviews don't exceed number 3.
I never had the feeling of intimidation by the staff but I was d*** sure accused of being rude to them whenever I defended myself pertaining to the am. And PM appointments. I know what I heard sitting in the lobby as other people were coming up to get their appointment scheduled and I know what was said to me when I walked up to the Desk to get appointment scheduled.I honestly believe this was an attack on me. I don't abuse my medicine it's bullshit that I was fired because  I can't make morning  appointments. I truly  hope this place fails. I see another of reviews  to where you are supervised during urine analysis.  I can say I was never watched to pee . AVOID THIS PLACE.  Boy oh boy you all are killing it in the reviews keep up the good work. Hire you some more 20 yr old nurses to run the side you never pay attention to. Because  the nurses in this establishment  will Sabotage your Dr.  I was fired for being rude ... I've been  going to this place for 5 yrs and I'm just now being rude.. go figure. Point is .. Unless you get shots in your spine you will never see tonkins face. 5 yrs folks have never seen his face. I literally  had to Google him to know what he looked like. And i've seen another review or a lady said that she was treated like a low life which is not surprising at all.. Considering they literally think that they can read people's minds. Apparently it's not just the nurses that are rude to patients. Here's a thought. How would the city of Springfield or the local news like to hear how you dispose of medication in the toilet at this facility or the health department?  I think I'll call to inform  them and ky3.",2025-01-30|2024-11-03|2024-12-17|2024-09-02|2023-04-11|2024-07-25|2024-04-18|2024-04-12,1|1|5|1|1|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ1WSqsYxkz4cR7tJ5fzs0z0A,241

I have been fighting a very painful situation for the past 4 years and everyone that I have been to kind of ignored me. Dr. Mark performed the most thorough exam I have ever had. He pinpointed my pain areas and reported them to Dr. Christofer who then came in and talked about how to help me. I left there with a plan finally. I am extremely happy with what I have experienced so far.|This is a fantastic office. I've had 6 total surgeries on my thumb and forefinger over the last 18 months including a complete fusion. I had been a patient of a pain management  Dr at BJC for 2 years during my surgeries. I was unhappy with then (they stopped listening, didn't offer any options other than narcotics, and,  when I brought up concerns over withdrawals, they completely dismissed me). I officially left their practice because my surgeon was willing to provide pain medication during recovery of my last surgery. I was optimistically naive in thinking I wouldn't be in pain afterward even though my surgeon had told me I would still be in significant pain. I went to a pain management in Belleville first. She got me mixed up with a other patient several times and answered 2 personal phone calls during our appointment. I was ready to just give up and had decided I'd just be in pain forever and would go through withdrawals on my own. On a whim I called this office. I'm beyond happy I did. The office staff is friendly and Mark is absolutely fantastic.  I walked out of my first appointment with a plan that will hopefully replace pain medication along with a plan to taper me off the pain medication. I feel like I finally found a pain management Dr and PA that actually listened to me and my concerns. I highly recommend this office :)|There is a huge communication issue here. I was never told after seeing the dr on my 1st visit here on I would be seeing her assistant.   Arriving to my 2nd visit I was set in an exam room and told dr Mark would be in.  I asked who that is?  Not my dr.?  But it was her assistant.  I had requested a dr appt. My MRI was no longer in chart and it was not retrieved.   I was never informed of the process that my future appts were not always with the dr.  My goal was to find out definitelythe source of my back. I even had the spit marked by the PT. I was referred by another dr. but did not know it was a pain management facility and so I was sent back  to the physical therapist who did help me.  As time passed, my intense pain had passed unless i moved wrong.  I was encouraged to get injections I didnt feel I needed.  I expressed 1st visit I had an MRI AND CT SCAN of my back but it was not where my pain originated or where it was. I still have not gotten another image of this area.  After multiple months the dr discovered the area but no further images were ordered.  I asked and expressed wanting to know what is wrong with back.  No difinitive conclusions or further testing was ordered. This was my purpose my original and following two visits.  I want to see the dr and be told what is the cause of my pain.  After requesting further information I was told to make another appt.  So after 3 primary appts and 3 appts with an ortho dr, I still do not know the state of my back that still causes me issues.  Im tired of being given pills or offered pain injections, paying numerous copays for visits and images thru an ER or a 3rd dr. After 11 months I still have no answers and the drs told me as much.  They ""dont know"" either.|I went to see Dr Christopher for chronic back pain on my left side. It was so bad I could hardly walk. She suggested two injections given two weeks apart. The first was fantastic, a barely felt the stick and the results were great. I could
rise from a chair without help, and walked much better. I was telling my husband he should make an appt. I couldn't wait to get the second. Well, the second was very uncomfortable to say the least. She had to stick me 4 or 5 times and probed around , saying , to get around the arthritis.
When we left  I was having a pain in my right hip , which wasn't hurting before. By the time I got home it was worse, pain shooting down the right leg causing cramping. I called the office and got the answer machine. I left a detailed message. No one EVER  called back. The next two weeks were horrible, sciatic nerve problems all on the left side. When I returned for the follow up I thought I would see the Dr but no just her assistant. After telling him what happened he said he would let her know. Still I had no response at all from the Dr. I'm through with them and would not recommend them for anyone.  They don't care!|Receptionist are beyond rude.  I will never trust a provider who does not want to view images. They only want the radiologists report  I understand the role of a radiologist.  But in the 6 years of different providers managing my back pain this is the only one to laugh at you wanting to bring the images.   Im unsure if they provide appropriate services bc I can't trust them to get to that point.|Dr. Chrisopher & her staff have given me my life back. I thought my gardening & other hobbies were just a beautiful memory but not any more. I can see myself doing these again. I suffered from severe back pain for over 10 years. I told myself that pain in life was inevitable but misery was optional. It finally got so miserable, I had to seek help. I found this in the team of Dr. Christopher. I am eternally grateful. They couldn't have more patient @ kind. The follow up even with the Abbott representative has been incredible. I can't recommend her enough. I have been a nurse for over 55 years & known many physicians. Dr. Christopher is one of the finest.     Donna Hobart|I have worked with Dr. Christopher and Physician Assistant-Mark Holder. I have received excellent care and exceptional amounts of time explaining my condition to me. I also received a unique Intracept procedure which has eliminated 95% of the lower back pain that I was experiencing.

His office staff would call me saying crazy things like I haven't seen him in 6 years and need to see him. I told them that was incorrect as my pump was less than 4 years old.  Told them to find my missing medical records but they never did including post-op notes.  The emergency alarm on the pump has been going off since March of 2024 and is still going off now. (Feb 2025).  This doctor has no regard for the health of the spine of his patients and I would be very caution especially if you have serious health problems.  You need to be aware if he did this to me, he will do it to you. Good luck if you choose to keep this doctor.|This office is fantastic. From the Dr, to the PA's, to the Nurses, to the Office staff, we highly recommend this pain clinic. They are compassionate, have empathy, do pre-authorizations correctly, and run their office smoothly.|Couldn't be any happier with the Dr, nurse practitioners, and any other nurse or office worker there. I have been coming here for 1-2 years now, but I've been doing pain management for 15 years now, and this is by far my best experience. Everyone is so nice, caring and make the whole process easy.   I'm about to get neurostim trial very soon.  Hopefully it helps. I've heard many good things.|Dr Beuer and his staff are so caring and professional. In a short period of time,they relieved my  nerve pain through ablation surgery. I highly recommend anyone to give this team a try. They will exceed your expectations.They most certainly did for me! May you too find good success by using their services.
Thanks|Been coming for the last three years for my back just mentioned to Jennifer the Nurse Practitioner about my knee pain. She immediately told me about knee injections and set me up to try them. They do my knees great. Total relief without extra medication to take. They are very knowledgeable and professional staff. Glad I found this staff and Dr. Beauer I recommend this place to you.|I was hurt in 07 and I have tried and done everything suggested  by Doctors.  I went to pain management,  chiropractor, my  primary doctor and neurosurgeon who fused my spine.  Nothing helped the pain.. The pain was horrible.  I could go for days unable to sleep.  A health professional suggested I see this doc.  Recently I received an implanted spinal stimulator.  I am receiving so much relief..  It feels so much better.  Yes, I still have pain, but its manageable with this wonderful device.  Doctor's staff are very kind, helpful and friendly.  I was met with concerned professionalism with each interaction.  Thank you, so much for your understanding, care and help.  I'm sleeping each and every night!|I've been a patient of Dr Beuer for nearly 5 years and since that time I have become a new person.  He is compassionate and caring but lets you know what you need to do to feel better and expects you to do it or he really can't be of much help.  It took a while for me to catch on to this but once I did, there's been no stopping me.  He said if I didn't lose weight, my back pain would never get any better and no amount of medication would help anymore.  I disagreed but he stood firm so I gave in.  Since then, I've lost 163 pounds, I can walk again, I can breathe again, my joints are not nearly as painful as they once were.  I get out again and am seriously considering going back to work full time.  I am not on pills that don't help anyway.  I have an implanted intrathecal pain pump that is exceptional.  It has helped my backpain more that any medication that I have ever taken.  I feel like a new woman and couldn't be happier.  My depression has even lightened up on me a bit.  Thank you Dr. Beuer for you caring kindness, your stubbornness, your intelligence, your skills and the best office staff and radiology staff ever!  I hope I never need to go anywhere else for pain care but you.  But, you could lose the country music in the procedure room.  Whatever happened to classic rock?  LOL|Dr. Beuer and his staff are wonderful.  My daughter has been under his care for a little over a year. She suffers from debilitating pain caused by Metastatic Breast Cancer in her bones. Dr. Beuer surgically placed an Intrathecal Pain Pump which delivers microdoses of medicine right where it is needed. His bedside manner is professional while genuinely caring.

I have been to other Back Pain Specialist, and none of them have ever been able to practically have me pain free. Interventional Pain Institute are by far the best place I have ever and will ever go to. His nurse practitioner Mindy is so good at what she does. She's kind and gentle. They  talk to you and find out Where the pain is coming from and located. They have found the perfect place For my injections in my back. This time My injection has lasted  eight months. I go back again in August 2024 and I will get another injection and I know it will last eight months as well.|Dr. Whitlow genuinely cares about his patients. He wants to make his patients comfortable. He has taken care of me now for about 3 years I believe. I feel I can talk to him and share my concerns and he listens to me and works with me to have a plan. He is the best Dr for pain management that I have been to and will not change. I have no need to.|Dr. Geith is an awesome physician with an excellent ""bedside manner"". His office and surgery center staff are very caring as well. Very efficient. Cleanliness was excellent at both  centers. I highly recommend Interventional Pain Institute for everyone suffering with chronic pain.
I am now very hopeful for my future.|First patient appt, dr. Whitlow was awesome. He explained to me that my treatment I was on previously with my old pain management doctor was not good for me because of my age. I got Cortizone steroid injections every three months in my back and knee. Long period of time this makes your bones brittle. He's got me on a new plan and I am super excited. I would highly recommend Dr. Whitlow, but I am sure all the other doctors in this practice are just as good. I walked out of the office with a smiles and excitement. I am 50 years old and I am a full-time nanny and grandmother And I do not wanna slow down.|The staff at this office is pretty incredible.  The doctor took the time to throughly examine and explain everything that's going on in my case. While there,  I experienced an unrelated medical incident and must say they were extremely professional and handled it accordingly. Thank you to the entire team!|I love this office. From the time you walk in they know you name. Your wait time is not long at all. They explain things to you and give you booklets. I had a morphine pain pump put in my body and after some adjustments I can say I rarely hurt.|Dr Gheith is a very friendly Dr.  He listened to my problems and has not brushed me off like other drs.  He put ia Nevro pain stimulator in my back, which has helped, and now we are trying to get my knees pain free.  He and his staff have been wonderful, and I have recommended him to other people.  Thank you Dr Gheith.|This doctor does not return calls. Well, one call was returned at 5:45 am. Really? The others I'm still waiting on a return call...3 weeks now. He does not have his patient's best interest in mind. He acts as though he is higher than the rest of the world.  Left me stranded in the hospital with no way to get in touch with him.

He can tell where the patient has pain and can fix or extremely reduce and relieve the pain with cortisone shots and if necessary prescribe medication. I get my cortisone shots every 3-4 months in my tailbone area and it relieves the pain in my lower back for a couple of months until the next cortisone shot !!! Excellent Dr and staff is very professional and courteous!!!|Dr. Noble talked about everything from meditation, prayer, drinking water, hot/cold packs and physical therapy. I have major back, knee and ankle pain. Providing medicine to get through my day pain free, wasn't even an option. A total waste of my time and insurance co-pay. I'll never return or recommend.|Every time I go here me and my family member are kept waiting 3 hours or more past our appointment time and then it's another 30 to 45 minutes before Dr. Noble comes and sees us. They really need to fix that, it seems very mismanaged. The stories from other patients I've spoken to have the same stories or even worse than what I had. There's no need to be kept waiting that long.|Only went a few times because shots in my back don't work. But I've seen first hand how he doesn't follow his own plans he discussed with his patient, they follow his rules even after having major surgery and still denies the use of pain medicine versus all these injections that last maybe two days or 4 days max. Won't be back nor will I recommend this joke of a doctor.|All staff are responsible as well as respectful.
These people care about you as a person and not as a patient...all are knowledgeable about their fields of study as well as many other fields.If you're on a pathway to becoming healthier- lay your footprints here because the knowledge and charisma between staff and patient can be considered a highly effective method in medical science- it works!|Maybe it not all the doctors fault, but I was on pain medication long before I started see Dr Noble, I have went along with all his recommendations, injections spinal stimulator, which I would not ever have done if he didn't push it. He will only treat my back pain, but I've been on the pain meds for severe osteoarthritis long before he came along. I've been fighting this arthritis since I was a teenager, I've had 14 surgeries just trying to keep working, I've had both hips replaced, currently both knees are bone on bone, both shoulders are bone on bone, I'm trying to maintain a job, but I did as Dr Noble told me to take no more pain meds than needed, some days are worse than others, I was prescribed a max of 6 pill a day,but many days only needed 4, so now as my pain has gotten to the point of out of control, he shorted me 60 pill this month when I told him my pain has gotten worse, so I called the office,  needing more meds to get through the month, and was told they couldn't help me because I didn't take 6 a day and only refilled my meds once in a month and a half, so they can't give me 180 like I always got,absolutely no compassion for someone who needs help it's his orders of not taking 6 a day when not needed that got me in this situation and now I'm just screwed,how are you supposed to keep your meds coming when you do as the doctor tell you and now because of his orders he won't give me the meds I've been using for years! I do not recommend this clinic, never once has he been on time for your appointment, always very late,like no one else matters but the doctor as far as time wasted sitting waiting to be seen 2 hours late when you are there on time but he's too busy to keep a schedule, and now this ordeal!|ONE STAR....HORRENDOUS I have been a patient of Noble's for many years, he knows how bad my back is. In addition to my back pain, I now have a very screwed up leg; I need a knee replacement plus I have a huge painful lump on my leg. The pain in my leg is joining the pain in my back. MY PAIN LEVEL IS AT OH MY GOD STAGE. On my last visit, (he had cut down on my meds) I asked if I could go back to where I was before, just until I can get my leg operated on. HE HAD HIS EYES CLOSED THE ENTIRE TIME OF MY VISIT. HE SAID BY GOING TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON & GETTING A SMALL SCRIPT OF TRAMADOL, I VIOLATED MY CONTRACT. HE MADE A NURSE WATCH ME PEE FOR THE DRUG TEST, AND WOULD NOT ORDER A STEROID SHOT FOR MY BACK WHICH WAS DUE. (I HAVE PERMANENT SCIATICA, PINCHED NERVE IN MY LOWER BACK) He said i needed to make another appointment. He has been getting weirder with every visit. He overbooks & the wait is usually 4 hours. His behavior has become bizarre, very dismissive, especially to female patients. He refuses to explain anything ( like MRI results) or listen to your concerns. The last steroid shot he gave me hurt really bad. Frankly he acts  like he is prescribing to himself. All he cares about is filling out the 5 page questionare the ""correct"" way. I will never go back to him, he treated me like I was pill shopping despite the fact I have sciatica, advanced scoliosis, bulging disks, a torn up-very swollen knee, a bowed out leg that gets so stiff & painful I can barely put weight on it. Not to mention he has lost so much weight & has had so much plastic surgery, he barely resembles what he looked liked 5 years ago.|Dr. Noble, and his staff, are professional, personable, and kind.

The man at the front desk doesn't seem to care much about his job. He is rude. Doesn't answer the phones. Doesn't call people back. I went to see Dr padda back in April and he was nothing but ignorant. Told me bc I had pink in my hair and I have tattoos, that it shows him that I have severe childhood trauma which is causing the pain in my feet. Excuse me, what?? Becuase I have pink hair and tattoos? Makes no sense! He then proceeded to tell me I needed to have many tests done. An MRI, X-RAYS and some other stuff I can't even remember.

Only things he wants to consider are physical therapy (which my insurance denied) and spinal injections for my back (which is only a small portion of my pain.) He does not believe in giving young adults pain medication, oral or otherwise. This is what he told me as a mother to a young legal adult myself . The rest of the staff I have met were incredibly helpful and sweet and have looked at him like he has bumped his dang head.|My  guy has chronic nerve pain in his face.  This pain clinic was recommended by his primary care Doc.  The gal who answered the phone was unbelievably rude. When asked if she had received the referral and being told that he was in lots of pain.  The gal responded by telling him that she had not received a referral and the doctor will not write pain prescriptions. All of this without having a clue as to the clinical nature of his need.  She did not even ask his name!!  So how the hell would she know if the referral arrived?  This place could care less about patients. Unbelievable.  We will seek care elsewhere.  Beware!|I'm in chronic pain all of the time everywhere, I have an illness combined with several diagnoses to numerous to mention. I have been to over 36 exceptional Specialist and none of them have been able to help me. Their comment is that I am over their scope of knowledge. Dr. Bult and Kelly are true professionals. They give me extraordinary care each and every time. The shots I receive in my hips, knees, shoulder, mid back, and lower back has increased my quality of life. It relieves non-stop pain for 1-4 weeks.  I do not live on pain pills. This is the best I can do since other Drs. Haven't been able to help me .
The personal care from this facility is of the highest rating I could give. Thanks for taking care of me when others didn't have a clue or even listen.|I am a a 60 man. Served my country for 33 years.  Dr. Bult and his Staff were very polite and professional during my office visit. After injections were given in my lower lumbar spine.

Dr. Liz is an exceptional doctor who genuinely cares about her patients. She listens with compassion, offers thoughtful advice, and always goes above and beyond to ensure the best care. Her dedication and kindness made a world of difference in my pain management journey. Dr. Liz is more than just a doctor; she's a wonderful person who truly makes you feel heard and supported.

Now I cannot find a doctor to help with the pain management because I was told to go to my primary care but, I utilize cannabis as well I'm on my second that won't prescribe to 10 mg oxycodones a day! Which wouldn't do much but, it's the principle! They work together so well but, one or the other does't do the trick! I've had so many injections with no relief, several nerve blocks, physical therapy, and tens etc. none of those worked so I depended on both and Liz had no problem with cannabis!! It's medically legal! I have no idea why it's ok to just cut legitimate chronic pain patients off for no reason! She followed the DEA guidelines to a T. I tried to email the marketing manager whom had backed the clinic a few years ago with no response! Now my 3 inner fingers on my right hand are numb and I've been waiting on a MRI for over 7 weeks! I've already had nerve damage from the issue being ignored!

I have never met more compassionate doctors in my life. They listen and they never rush you. And they are on the cutting edge with technology and research. Please go if you are living with pain. Your quality of life will change for the better and possibly permanently!!!
This is my story. When I first met with them I was having horrible hip pain and was in tears. I had been to specialists for hips in the St. Louis area and did not need a replacement so they didn't offer other solutions. Dr. Shomstein injected both of hips suspecting bursitis. I immediately felt relief and had a number of injections and have never had to return for my hip pain. I have been pain free for 4 years. They actually listen to you and you are never rushed because they are perfectionists and get to the root cause of the problem . I have recommended them to a lot of my friends and they have all been thrilled with the results. I have not seen Dr. Shomstein in years and had a shoulder replacement two years ago and have been suffering with horrible neck pain. The chiropractor wasn't helping so I immediately called them. They got me in quickly and sent me for an MRI and determined that I had arthritis in my C1 and C2. Dr. Shomstein is so intelligent and did a thorough check of my neck. He was 99 percent confident that my  surrounding muscles  were causing the pain. Instead of putting injections into my spine, which can be really scary and is more invasive, he put injections into all of the muscles that he suspected were  the issue. He took the less invasive procedure first. Within 3 days I realized he solved the problem. I started sleeping through the night. Hadn't in 2 years! I returned today, a month later for my follow up and told him that I was 95 % better. I hugged him and almost started crying. Living with pain becomes debilitating and I thought I had to live with this. Being the perfectionist that he is, he put a couple of injections  into the areas that were still causing slight issues. I will return in 3 weeks and I know I will report that I am 100% better. I have a very stressful job and carry my stress in my neck like most of I do! And I'm 57. So if you are sick of living with pain, go see them. Do not live in pain!!!!!!|Dr. Mekler and Rimma are phenomenal. So caring, helpful, and help my pain SO much when no one else would listen. I'm so grateful for them and would highly recommend them. They do shared decision making and want to get to the root of the issue to help!|I had left the care of Dr. Mekler and Dr. Adam. I'm so glad I'm back. Dr. Mekler goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable during the entire process. I only get a glimpse of Dr. Adam from time to time but every time he's smiling. Rimma is so helpful and friendly.
I drive from St. Louis Lambert Airport area to Fenton. Definitely worth the drive. Thank you Dr. Mekler!|Where do I begin with Dr. Mekler and Dr. Shomstein?  I can live my life again because of the compassionate care and brilliance that are these two wonderful human beings!  I've been receiving care under these two now going on 7 years and to say they are amazing is an understatement!  First, I was able to get off almost all of the medications I was taking due my multiple chronic illnesses, secondly,  I was able to go back to work after 5 years, and lastly they provided me with hope for my future again.  I can't begin to thank these two enough for helping me regain my life back and for always being in my corner...THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  YOU ARE BOTH ANGELS WALKING ON THIS EARTH!!!|Every visit delivers the highest of patient care. Always providing the time to listen,understand and address each individual(s) concerns & needs. Honestly I don't believe... I've ever...(I mean EVER) experienced this level of kindness, and caring for their patients elsewhere. Because of this, my healing journey began here, and all of the blessings have followed. I'm forever changed, and thankful beyond words. Thank you, thank you,thank you for everything you do for me!|Dr. Shomstein and Dr. Mekler are a phenomenal team. Truly a personalized approach, they do not approach pain with a ""one size fits all"" mentality. They are thorough and take the time to make sure the patient understands the plan of care. They do their procedures in the office which is very convenient! They are super kind and knowledgeable, you can tell that they are truly committed to making you feel better. So glad I found them!|Wonderful office staff and amazing doctors! Rimma is so kind and communicative! And Dr. Shomstein is thorough and informative - he spends a lot of time with his patients to correctly diagnose the problem and discusses treatment options in depth allowing patients to make an informed decision about their care. Dr Mekler has assisted in several of my procedures and is really empathetic and wonderful, as well! Best pain management experience I've ever had... the entire staff is truly committed to helping patients overcome the obstacles acute or chronic pain can cause and they really care about their patients' quality of life!|A lifetime of working in the construction industry, resulted in 3 back surgeries, a neck surgery, arthritis and a host of day in and day out pain scenarios; (many of which would immobilize me). These Doctors specifically have gotten me through not only pain management to be able to function, but have actually gotten me to a point where I am off all pain meds, restored mobility and strength, and minimized my need for followup visits to very little at all. These are not your typical Doctors. They actually are what Doctors should be, not what the industry standard spews out. They are the most engaged, most competent health care professionals and are consistent over and over applying those characteristics. If you are overwhelmed with your pain, feeling that you have no hope of ever reclaiming life without pain, tired of being an insurance claim and forced into standard industry molds, you need these Doctors. Both are excellent and invest into your health with genuine concern and application for relief.",2024-08-17|2024-05-22|2024-05-04|2023-10-13|2023-12-05|2023-09-27|2023-07-25|2023-08-01,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do they use sedation.",canmyhusbandkendrickkeeonwilliamascomemonday,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ2z269afT2IcRi0yXK00Y640,50

Going through anything that requires pain management is a frustrating process. Dr. Oliver was extremely kind and attentive. He explained everything to me in great detail. He listened to everything I had to say and addressed every concern I introduced.
This is a journey and not expected to be fixed with one visit.
That being said. I highly recommend that you disregard the blatantly negative remarks made by the lady who clearly only had 1 visit. Go and meet him for yourself! You will not be disappointed!|I was very disappointed by dr oliver's condescending manner and basically dismissing the amount of pain I'm in. I ended up going to the hospital in excruciating agony and have been here for 5 days now. Why? Because they actually listened and are arranging for surgery on not only my back which the dr opted to barely listen to the problem but my hip, which the dr completely ignored when I tried to discuss it with him. His hopefully this will work attitude towards his treatment plan left me very uncomfortable trusting him with my health.|I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and have been treated by a few different doctors over the past 20 years including some of the world-renown pioneers in Pain Management. Although my specific condition details are unique, I have found success with a particular regimen of medications and the use of a spinal cord stimulator.

My situation is unique and complex enough to not allow most pain doctors to work with me because of Governmental limitations and restrictions. Most doctors have refused to even see me when they hear what is wrong with me and how I am currently being treated.

Dr. Oliver (and others at the Interventional Pain Institute) have been nothing but professional and compassionate with me. I have resigned myself to the idea that I will likely live my (hopefully) many-remaining years in moderate-to-severe pain. They have helped give me hope again that more relief... maybe even significantly more relief is a possibility and they are willing to work with me to try.

Pain management is a difficult industry to work in. As I have witnessed for myself, a third to half of the people sitting in the waiting rooms of a pain clinic are just looking to get high on opioids and most of them don't actually want rehab. That makes it much harder on those of us in actual pain and in need of those doctors and the devices and medications they use. IPI does a great job sifting through the drug seekers so they can concentrate on those who have actual needs, and THAT is as much a service to those of us being served as it is to the doctors themselves.|All staff is very friendly and so far my appointments have been on time with little to no wait! Dr. Oliver is great! He wasn't quick to judge me or label me as a drug seeker as some other pain management doctors have in the past. He took the time to really listen to what is going on. He is very detailed in what the MRI showed and used a model that was very helpful to understand where my pain is coming from and how we can treat it. During my injection procedure I was able to talk to him and get to know him a little more, was very comfortable with him and staff, and he has very nice bedside manner. I highly recommend Dr. Oliver and his staff!!!|2023. I Had three expensive procedures but  received no relief. I am being charged additionally although I paid $222. For each co`pay.  I feel used as income source not as patient.... The last appointment I was called in am & told not to come.  Didn't get message. Charged anyway.  I paid over over $1000 in co-pays. Current charge over $300. No explanation as to what charge i is fr.  Supposedly covered by insurance.  Feel scammed. Not told of cost beforehand . Got zero Relief. Do not waste  your money|I loved Dr Oliver when he first came to St Louis.  He took over after my old doctor retired.  I'd been with his practice for 10 years.  These are pain management doctors.  They treat pain.  I have had a back surgery and still really suffered from a lot of pain.  When Dr Oliver started with me I told him my goals were to get off the medications and see if there was anything else we could try.  We tried different spinal shots, some even worked for a while.   Then it got a lot tougher.  We decided to do a spinal stimulator.  The trail went great and I was approved.  I was sent to a spine surgeon who wanted to do some more tests.  To Make a long story short, I needed 2 spine surgeries and then just hope it didn't get worse.  I had the surgery 5 weeks ago.  About 3 weeks in I get a letter from Dr Oliver letting me know he was changing offices and could no longer treat me.  No referrals no advice.  He said he may know one doctor and he would call me back.   He hasn't called.  I've called to follow up only to have an extremely rude woman who did not identify herself basically tell me to just go away.  No one there will help me.  I am 5 weeks out from a double spine surgery.  After 10 years with this same doctors office and zero problems, this is how I was treated.  I have even had drug tests that proved I was taking my meds as directed.  I understand that there is a lot of pressure on these doctors but there are ways to help people and treat people.  Dr Oliver promised to call me back and then turned his back on me.  I am so disappointed and scared.  I need help and don't know where to turn.  Don't put yourself in this position.  Stay away from Dr Oliver and Signature Orthopaedics.|Dr. Oliver is such a good Dr.! He is very interested in what you have to say and do whatever tests are necessary to find the problems you are having. He puts my mind at ease, after all he is going to be inserting needles in my back! I'm scared of needles but he makes sure I'm comfortable. I highly recommend Dr Oliver. He's an excellent Dr.|I had Dr. Oliver perform another cortisone injection procedure on my hip.  As before, it was a great experience.  It was not without some minor pain and discomfort but the outcome made it all worthwhile.  Dr. Oliver is very good at explaining the procedure (what he's going to do and what area will be affected) and making sure I'm comfortable with everything that's going on with my medical care.  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a competent, qualified orthopedic/pain management specialist.  I've been seen by several such doctors but he ranks at the top of my list.

On a side note, the only issue I have with Dr. Oliver is his support of the LSU Tigers (as I'm an Alabama Crimson Tide man)!  LOL  But in all seriousness, he is an outstanding doctor that provides great care to his patients!",2024-08-07|2024-07-04|2024-06-25|2020-02-08|2024-01-30|2019-12-16|2021-01-14|2020-10-16,5|1|5|5|1|1|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJl07KXXcz34cRMjH63qJQxpg,106

I have been going to this office for 3 months and Dr. Schmidt and his staff are very respectful and care about you. I made a call to the nurse today and the nurse called me back within a half hour. I was very impressed because my previous pain dr wouldn't call me back, sometimes for days. I'm very happy with everyone in Dr. office!!|If you want to wait...and wait....then have a doctor smugly brush your thoughts about your own care aside, then Dr. Schmidt is your guy. If you like to be talked down to and be judged for needing pain meds to function than he's absolutely perfect for you! I spent two and a half hours there today and ended up walking out before finishing up my appointment!|I had been a patient of dr. Brian Smith when he was in practice here prior to his retirement. I had been going to this office for many years and they used to take very good care of me and help with my chronic pain from multiple sclerosis. I had always been satisfied with services here prior to recently visiting. I had moved away for a couple years so I hadn't used this office.
I recently moved back into town and scheduled an appointment with the office thinking that I was going to get the help that I needed with my chronic long-term illness as they had always been so reliable in the past. However when I went to my appointment 2 months ago I first waited in the office for an hour and a half before they called me to the back then once I was back in the room they take my vitals then the nurse informs me that I now had to fill out a new patient packet because they have a new system since I had last been seen. now mine do I had already waited an hour and a half in the lobby and could have filled out the paperwork at that point so now I had to wait even longer to complete this paperwork before I could be seen by dr. Schmidt. I am about 10 to 15 minutes into filling out the paperwork then another nurse comes into the room and says, ""I am sorry Ms. Augustus but we will not be able to help you today if you are expecting any kind of medication prescribed to you."" I then asked why wouldn't you guys have told me that sooner after sitting here for two and a half hours and as I'm balling my eyes out because my pain is so severe at this point what am I supposed to do I'm here asking for help with my pain you guys are licensed pain specialist and now you're trying to tell me that you are unable to prescribe me some type of medication for my chronic pain! Then she goes to say well I'm sorry but dr. Schmidt no longer prescribe pain medication he only does injections. I know that is a lie because I seen him writing prescriptions for other patients who were waiting on them in the lobby so now I feel like the staff is lying to me and why would they not want to help me especially since I had been a patient here for many many years? I left the office in tears I'm feeling so hopeless with getting help for my pain. I have a serious chronic illness again multiple sclerosis so it's not like I'm coming in there with nothing wrong with me I'm just curious as to why they would be so quick to shut somebody down and turn them away when that is their job to help people with their pain I'm very dissatisfied and will never recommend this office to anyone.|Dr Smith's staff are fantastic they made you feel comfortable and we're very professional and knowledgeable and felt that you were an important patient to them.... with the procedure/injection on my back I was in and out in less than an hour and that was with anesthesia... Even though they told me it would take at least 2 days to have the effect of the injection I felt so much better in 2 hours it drop my pain level from a constant five to six to a level of two..... It is currently 20 hours since the injection and procedure and I am still at a level two constant.,. They said I might have some irritation or pain or the first 24 hours and to put ice on it and then heat but I have had no need for any kind of treatment to the injection area it's like never happened as far as that goes..,.... Now since it has been only 20 hours since the procedure only time will tell on the length of the effect but so far I am extremely pleased.,... I'm not sure if I can but I will try to give an update on the effects in a few weeks...... So far I highly recommend this company Dr Smith with his great staff it was a real pleasure|the doctor takes his time with you and answers all your questions the staff is nice there is a staff member at the washington mo office named Anna that was so very nice and listened to what i had to say and didnt rush me off the phone i would definetly recommend that office|DR.

However thats because when I was brought back into the treatment area I looked around and the office is disgusting. I have seen gas station restrooms cleaner than this office. There was no way I was going to let someone do a trigger point injection on me in this office. And when I pointed this out and let the staff know I was leaving they became rude and condescending.|You know the first couple yrs I really enjoyed Dr Mohd he had me almost pain free and then in one visit he yanked everything down to 1/4 of the he previously ordered and made me stop the klonipin that I had been in for 15 yrs. I tried standing up for myself but was quickly laughed at and told I wouldn't b seen anymore. So for a year and half I went through living hell seeing other pain mgmt that forced u to have 3-4 injections every other week. Finally I made an appt at a normal MD  with one look at my file he took me on with my pain meds and also gave me back the klonipin. Which tells me that Dr Mohd did not have to treat a 2 yr patient the way I was treated. I'm not saying he's a bad Dr but I don't feel he's a good Dr either. Thnx|Dr Modh is great. He actually cares about giving ppl relief. Long term patients need to understand he has to follow DEA regulations regarding opiates.  Currently, I highly recommend.|He is an amazing Doctor, with the best bedside manner, I am so glad I was sent to him, my pain level was beyond a 10, now my pain is bearable, it will never go completely away, but at least now I can do things I never could before, but if you are just looking for drugs and a high don't bother because you have to take a drug test every time you go and that is to ween out the addicts, which is fine with me. Keep up the good work Doc.|I was just glancing at the reviews on Dr Modh and staff.  I was shocked at some of the low ratings!  I have been seeing Dr Modh monthly for almost 7 years.  I am a retired Substance Abuse Counselor.  I am very much aware of the possibility of addiction with chronic pain as is Dr Modh.  I get shots most every time I see him.  And I can tell you this, I WOULD NOT TRUST ANY DOCTOR OTHER THAN HIM TO STICK NEEDLES IN MY BACK!!  I had a prior pain physician that used some type of stimulation using electricity without explaining anything.  I ended up going into shock, couldn't walk, mind totally messed up.  Finally had them call a friend who took off work and took me home and stayed until the next day.  Last time for that doctor!  If you want a GOOD PHYSICIAN, Dr Modh is for you!|Dr Modh is a very down to earth Dr. Explains everything completely. My 1 and only complaint was called around 1pm for a pill count at same same my sons car broke down with his wife and 2 babys in the car. This was during our little heat wave. I called Dr Modhs office to see if could reschedule appt was told either make it in or be terminated. Family comes 1st hated to lose you as a dr. BUT TO BE FAIR DR.MODH gets 5 Stars|If I could give this doctor and his staff zero stars I would! How can a doctor, when you're in so much pain, chronic pain, refuse an elderly woman any kind of pain medication, and just smile and smirk as you're speaking with her? This is the worst so call doctor that I have ever experienced and all they will do is take your money and take away all hope for quality life. They should be ashamed of themselves to treat patients in this manner!|He's A Great Pain Dr! He answers all Questions and is Very Responsive to your needs.

I have dealt with chronic pain in my neck for over 25  due to a cervical fusion in 2001.  I was skeptical that I could get through a day without the help of medication, yet here I am.

I am back working, driving and being like 'normal' people function now. I still have many things that are a challenge, but I am grateful for all the things that have been restored to my life.|Dr. Smith and the entire staff were amazing!  I had previously had a bad experience with back injections so I was quite nervous going in. That was all put to rest with the attentive staff and Dr. Smith!  No anesthesia required and painless!!!!  Just an overall amazing experience!  Thank you so much!|Extremely incompetent staff. Failed to contact my insurance provider in time twice for the same procedure. Now I have to schedule for the 3rd time. They blame my insurance company, but I called the insurance company, and the truth is this pain management office just dropped the ball, big time. As a result, I'm sitting here in extreme pain, waiting for my procedure, much longer that I should have. I also have to cancel my vacation plans. Thanks a lot.

Update for Summer 2022: Last year I finally got the injection after several cancellations, due to the incompetent staff here. Dr. Greg Smith did the injection and it went surprisingly well. It was painless. Now I need another injection one level up. I decided to try Greg Smith again because I know he knows what he's doing. Sadly his staff is worse than ever. Extremely rude and dragging their feet on getting the procedure approved through insurance. It's no big deal for them, but I'm in pain, and I also have to arrange someone to drive me to the procedure, so I can't be playing these games where it may or may not be approved on my injection date. Really sad that such a great doctor has such an abysmal staff.|The one doctor  that retire was truly the best. Doctor Johann was a doctor that performed several services for me as a client. Unfortunately  he his no longer there, great understanding, caring and a thoughtful kind hearted professional.

I highly recommend seeing him.|I have suffered from severe pain most of my adult life and have been treated by multiple doctors, but Dr. Fan is by far the best one I have had the opportunity of meeting, and he is the most kind and caring of any doctor you could meet. So many times, I have suffered so severely that it has robbed me of any normalcy in life, and I found myself unable to function. With the help of Dr. Fan, I have finally started showing improvement and seeing a brighter future for myself.
So for those genuinely suffering from physical pain and who want to get help, please know that there is nothing anyone or any drug you can take that will ever take the pain away completely; it is just not possible. Still, with the help of Dr. Fan, you can finally manage it and even have a chance to return to everyday life. But please know, as I said, no miracle drug or Doctor works miracles that can take all the pain away.
I highly recommend Dr. Fan to all my family, friends, and anyone else who suffers, as I have over the years.|I have been a patient of Midwest Pain and Spine for several years now and Dr. Fan, his nurse practitioner Lacy, and the staff have always treated me kindly and respectively. Dr. Fan and Lacy are very easy to communicate treatment plans and procedures with so that you know you are getting the best care possible. I've received several injections and physical therapy within their office and I would highly recommend Midwest Pain and Spine  to friends and family members.|Dr Zhu gave me an epidural shot in my back May 25, 2023 and I was never told to bring a driver so while I was laying on the bed , the nurse as me if I had someone waiting and I said no but the Dr proceeded to give me the shot.  I  didn't feel right when I left there and I told the girl at the desk and she never told me to sit down for a while so I left and went to Walmart in Desloge and when I got out of my vehicle my legs were totally numb, I had to have someone come help me and ended up at Parkland Hospital ER!!

They have provided me with the latest in all care and procedures available out there which keeps me about 85 to 90 percent pain free most of the time. I am very pleased with those results. The whole staff there is very friendly and helpful   I feel at ease and cared for by all of the staff  when I'm there. I would recommend the Midwest Pain and Spine center for your needs as far as pain.|The people that work at mid west are amazing. They are very helpful and informative. They have my new appointment set before I ever get up to the desk and they always greet you with a cheerful voice. My dr and nurses are top notch. I went to several pain therapy dr before I came here and since I have visited this office I have never nor  will I ever go anywhere else. The receptionist at the office are amazing as well.|Do not waste your time or money. They do not care about their patients. All they care about is giving injections and getting as many office visits as they possibly can. Each time my back hurts they want me to make an appointment just to tell them my back hurts and schedule an injection. Then you have to come back for injection then they want a follow up visit as well. Therefore when my back hurts they get three office visits for one occasion. When you run out of medicine they won't give you refills without making you come back over and over again. Even for patients who don't take or want narcotics like myself. I take an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxer, neither one is a narcotic. Have had an MRI that shows I have bulging discs in my back. Why do I need to keep coming back to be seen when they already know what's wrong with me and my prescriptions are non-narcotic. Every 3 months they just stop re-filling prescriptions if they decide they want to get you for an office visit. When you call to ask why your medication hasn't been refilled whoever it is that answers the phone is very defensive and quite frankly rude. It is always my fault or the pharmacy's fault on why I can't get a refill, NEVER their fault. One thing I can say is they do not discriminate.... Everyone gets treated like a drug addict, rather you take narcotics or not. Guess I should have read the reviews before I trusted my doctor's referral. Don't see a single good review and am not surprised. All I want is for my back to feel better. Been going here for over a year and they are awful. I have finally had enough and am going somewhere else.

Just as another stated. Absolutely unacceptable behavior. Rude and impossible to even get an appointment. 1st call, I was told I needed a consultation appointment first which sounded like they were going to get scheduled and I tried to make that and the call dropped. When I called back, I was told in a rude tone, they can't make any appointments till I have my doctor send over my MRI results and hung up rather quickly, as if I was wasting their time. When I did this, I called again and was told I needed something else from my referring doctor, which I suppose I needed to make a list and expected to have all of this other stuff sent over. When I told them to forget it and explained why I was going to use another office (being that other doctors contact the referring office to request exactly what they need) not making the patient the constant go between (they know what they need).  Anyway, at this, ""Kathy"", who I believe was the person I dealt with each time, told me she didn't need a lecture, to which I explained that I was trying to let her know why their office will not get my business (to improve their procedures), she hung up on me.
Don't even bother calling this place and wasting your time.
I called my referring doctor, told them the issues and was given another place to use. Called that place and made an appointment with zero issues, like the last 20 + years of making an appointment and going to a doctor.|Dr. Coleman is an amazing doctor with a great bedside manner . He does everything possible to help you reduce the pain. I trust him 100%.|The sheer incompetence of the office staff is astounding. I've had numerous procedures done here that were covered. I had a different procedure done and I specifically asked if they got it pre-approved through my insurance, long story short they did not and my insurance wont retroactively approve a procedure that's already been done. Their militant billing department insists I owe them money due to their incompetence. Every time I call the front office the phone rings and never gets answered. I would not only avoid this clinic, Id recommend avoiding the entire SSM group in its entirety you'll be avoiding a massive headache.|Custo.er service is really going diwnhill.  I have been hung up on 4 times this morning not appreciated.  We work over the road and need prescription refills when asked not at a normal convenience of when i can get to it.  Very unhappy with the customer service at this office.|I've seen Dr Coleman multiple times in the past 7 years, and am floored at how unprofessional his office staff can be.   Talking to them today was the ultimate in frustration.  Was told they don't have any records for me, even though they acknowledge I'd been seen in 2019.  Tried to understand since it didn't make sense, but was given the ""I'm following policy"".|Love Ann at the front desk, dr coleman is awesome and the nurses are great. HOWEVER dealing with the lady that makes the appointments is not fun. If you make an appointment and change your mind and want to schedule a different one, she acts like you committed a cardinal sin and doesn't hide the fact that you have put her out.  This has happened twice and I have been to that office several times. She is very demeaning and I'd rather continue in pain than deal with her. I've held my tongue because when I come out after a procedure, I am still doped up and don't want to get in a confrontation but she apologizes profusely to the person that comes to her area and has to wait until she finishes with me but she is very short and curt with me. If you make an appointment and don't change your mind, you are good to go! Just don't change your mind. She will let you know about it and will talk down to you. She needs an attitude adjustment.....|I have not met Dr. Coleman yet but am already impressed with him and his staff. They have spoken to me a number of times over the last couple of weeks in planning for a procedure my 93 year old mother will be having tomorrow to treat a compression fracture in her spine. Everyone has been very professional and answered all my questions. Today Dr. Coleman called me to introduce himself, describe the procedure, and ask detailed questions concerning my mother's present physical condition and special requirements she might have. We were on the phone for almost 25 minutes!  When was the last time you had a doctor spend that much time with you?|Dr. Coleman is the undoubtedly the best doctor I have ever had. I have been going to him for years and have always been treated with respect and and no questions have gone unanswered. He's never in a hurry to rush me through anything. His staff is top notch, caring, compassionate, and helpful through every procedure I have ever had there. They are the best. Wouldn't go anywhere else.

ID like to add that the ESI procedure that Dr Naylor did gave me my life back. Can't wait to feel the full potential of the procedure. I'm 6 days out.

Emily and the new girl were amazing and compassionate! Made a very dreaded visit unexpectedly pleasant and less anxiety inducing! Dr Baylor was awesome. Explained everything in lamen terms. Thank you for all you do!|My husband was not only in excruciating pain from a herniated disc in his neck, but also having a horrible time with the meds he was on. We were quickly losing hope as the wait to get into a pain management doctor was as long as the neurosurgeon. Dr. Naylor and his office were wonderful at working us in when they heard about our plight and Dr. Naylor himself was nothing short of amazing. He switched my husbands medications immediately and it helped his side effects tremendously. When we met Dr. Naylor we were very impressed. He took the time to show us the MRI with explanations, but most of all, answered all of our questions. We felt like we were finally getting somewhere and had a plan in place as we waited for our neurosurgeon appointment. In this office you will find a very helpful, caring and courteous staff. We would never hesitate to refer Dr. Naylor and his office to our friends and family. He has been an amazing find and is truly an asset to our community.|There was no compassion

I was new to pain management, I had an office visit where I was told what I needed insurance probably wouldn't cover. Got a call insurance covered it, the procedure was set. The wait time sucked but really what's new in a doctors office. The part where it takes a real bad turn is coming up. So I get called back they they take my vitals and give me the blue hat and leave me to wait. When I get called back they took me to a cold room where they had me lay on a table, legs on pillow stands the nurses disinfect my knees. When doctor Nayler came in he didn't really talk to me he asked to confirm my info that's it. I began to feel anxious as I'm strapped to a bed and no one is really letting me know what's going on. Dr. N tells the nurses that they have to take one of my legs down and will disinfect it again later. Without warning he stabs the needles into my knee and I jumped a little he got frustrated/annoyed and snapped at me not to move. I told him that if he tells me what he's doing it would help he just acted like a jerk. I was in pain because that does not feel like a sting or a pinch it feels like a needle going in my leg set the expectations right. So here I was alone extremely anxious, too scared to speak up anymore and in pain. That's how my first pain management procedure went.|Every person I worked with was so kind and understanding. Most of my pain management came from lifestyle changes. Replacing my old  bed, physical therapy, rest. Jessica was determined to help and she did. Several others, not in this clinic, did not bother. They aren't miracle workers but pretty darn close.|This specific review is merely just to give some serious props to the NP Jessica Latham. I can't even explain how relatable and genuine she is! I have felt heard with every appointment I've had with her. She really allows me to be heard. That is all a patient can ask for.|I've been at this place for the past few years and on my first visit the doctor that I seen was great but unfortunately he left and I always wondered why? Well I found out from my own experience that they will give you injections injections injections injections injections and after the 10th one and so manny different high priced prescriptions that don't do anything for pain at all not feeling any relief after every single one them they want you to make an appointment to talk about surgery/back stimulation. So I made the appointment was told that I would be covered for the stimulation by the office so I decided to get the appointments scheduled for the MRI they needed and another doctor that was $350 bucks just for him to tell me this may or may or work. Got all that done the day after all of these appointments they called me and said we are sorry but your not covered for the stimulation I asked well how much would it be out of pocket I was then told on the phone it would be anywhere between 10-30k so I laughed and said so there's no more options besides this. And you know they always say ""unfortunately not"" so I hung up then after that happens I get a letter stating that they will no longer  see me in that office making it sound like I've been kicked out of there or they are going to refuse me. I spoke to other doctors in the city since this. And I'm getting way better options that I have ever received from this office. As soon as they figured out I couldn't pay 10-30 thousand dollars for back stimulation that was it they was done with me throw me out next person in line let's see what got!. So please save your time and what little money you have left after paying for mass amounts useless injections and what water pills they prescribe you. Do yourself a huge favor go somewhere else and learn from my mistake !|Dr hahn insisted that after 2 months being off pain medication for the first time in over 10 years that I would be thanking him.  I like many others had been cutoff medication and left with no options feeling completely hopeless with no where to turn and no medication to help with pain, not fake pain actual pain.  Mine happened to stem from being hit by a car as a pedestrian and having 17 surgeries,  Within the first two months of being off of medication for the first time in my life had turned to illegal narcotics and when that didnt work i attempted suicide and spent 4 days on a respirator then put in the mental health care system...  My life at this point is the worst it has ever been.  i lost my children, my home, and pretty much my life.  The opoid crisis is a joke cutting patients off, not helping them with alternative pain management solutions has forced law abiding citizens in need to actually start using street drugs...What a system and a joke...  So to answer your question dr hahn, yeah i nor anyone with actual injuries will ever call you and thank you and tell you that their life is better for cutting them off with no form of replacement therapy and pain management solutions.   i have been homeless, resuscitated, lost my children and pretty much feel like id be better off|I never even saw the doctor I was supposed to see. I dont know if I know the font desk person or if I just rubbed her the wrong way but I felt like she was very condescending and offended by everything that came out of my mouth. I find the person at the front desk to be most important as they set the tone for a visit. By the time I went back to the room my stomach was so upset I just left.

I have seen him several times as a referral from my orthopedic doctor whom I trust tremendously. I had my first nerve block today. The procedure went very well, and I was nervous as I had never had one previously. He was not quick to suggest this procedure, which I respect very much. I did try other procedures, such as physical therapy and Cortizone shots prior. They just weren't working for me this time.|Very pleasant experience! The staff was professional and courteous!  My experience with Dr. Khader was pleasant as well. He is very interested in helping to relieve your pain. What struck a cord with me the most was when I a concern  HE called me back. That is VERY RARE in today's medical society!! You typically get a call back delivered by an office staff. I made me feel valued by the doctor himself!|I waited an hour longer than my scheduled appointment. The office signs say the doctor see all patients according to their appointment.  The doctor had me stand up bend from side to side. He bent my legs and knees and feet. He was on my chart the majority of time. He had an assistant.I was not told why.Dr Khader ordered an MRI. I was given a piece of paper and told to call the number and schedule my MRI and a piece of paper to do some morning exercises. Why did the receptionist not do this..The clinic was empty when I left. I told her there was a double charge on my debit card. She called billing and told me they said it wasn't. Because I was on hold for so long I just left.I will not b returning to this office ever again.The environment was not welcoming and I left feeling worse than when I came, mentally   and physically..|It was a very calming experience all the way through. All the staff and Dr.Khader were great. I only wish I new about him sooner!|Dr Khader was right on time and very attentive to my lower back and hip pain issues. He did not rush me at all and offered new things to try to ease my chronic pain. I will recommend Dr Khader to my family and friends.|Dr. Khader is wonderful. Explains everything so clearly and let's you know what is the best treatment. Does not rush into the treatment but checks with tests first. He is very personable. I highly recommend him.|Doctor Khader listened to my issues and quickly got to the problem. Very knowledgeable, professional and kind. Showed a lot of common sense in his treatment and advice. A very good experience.|The staff was very kind & professional.

I highly recommend them!|This office is amazing. I have not ever been treated so well by so many staff members. They were all so kind and really cared about me. They were not pushy about anything and explained my options well.|Very busy place. I suppose that says a lot about how good they are. Took a while to get appointment but was taken good care of. Shots went very well. I have had them quite a bit so I know when they don't go well. Everyone did a great job and Doctor Sanders is very knowledgeable and good at what she does.|We had the same exact experience as the other reviewer Hal.  My husband pad rotator cuff surgery and his doctor very clear that it was impaired at Mark have some kind of injection directly into a very particular spot of the shoulder. The surgeons wife is Dr. Rebecca Sanders so she referred my husband to her. Despite repeated calls on our part and even request the day of the referral to give us the doctors phone number south so we can advocate for ourselves and get it done quicker, it has been four weeks.Still no injection and still no appointment for the injection. By the way we have very good health insurance that does not require referrals to specialists. But this doctors office did not wanna believe us and had to wait to find out for themselves even though we would have guaranteed payment out of our own pocket in necessary. The health of my husband is more important than the bureaucracy of insurance. She's a good doctor or not because the car never happened.|Who knows if the doctor is good or not. It takes a month to get a preliminary appointment.  Then you're told we need all your records. You tell them I can pull that up right now. No not good enough. We need written authorization. I go to records and ask that my imaging be sent. Weeks go by and no word from doctor. I call and ask and am told we need reports too. I get hold of medical records and ask them to send my reports. Crickets from the doctor's office. I call and receptionist tells me she doesn't know if they have them yet or not and they are already scheduling 2 months out for the next appointment. If you're too busy to see a patient or really don't care about the patient, just tell them so they can go somewhere else. What a horrible system.|Dr Sanders has helped me with my pain.  She is so caring,  and good at her job.  She really knows how to give shots,  unlike other doctors I've tried in the area,  you have to know what you are doing.|I've had knee and hip pain for 9yrs. I expected the pain and inability to function that I would be wheelchair bound but with the shots in my low back and the knee  ablation I'm close to being pain free Thankyou Rebecca Sanders|Worst place ever. I didn't even get in to be seen. No one and I mean no one knows what they are doing. I heard them disrespect customers who call in. Talk negatively about patients where others patients can over hear.

After his therapy of ten weeks I NO LONGER CRY IN PAIN at night. This means the world to me!

His care is personal and professional. His facility is always clean and well outfitted with all the equipment you need to feel better.

My whole family comes here for care - my mom is 83 years old and is a regular customer and her life is better because Dr Mohr is in it.

My Aunt is in her 70s and loves him too and he has helped her for years

In today's world  where so much business is just transactional I challenge you to come here and get first class personal service from Dr Mohr and his staff.

After 14 weeks of therapy, I was back at work and felt great. The personal attention I received from the beginning reassured me that I was in the right place. So happy with my results. Would highly recommend Dr. Mohr to anyone and carry his cards in my wallet for just that reason.|UPDATE: After leaving my review, Aaron Mohr called me and left a voicemail asking me multiple times to ""reconsider my review."" I feel that is extremely unprofessional. My review was honest and I was not rude in any way. Although, his response to my review is well written and nice, his voicemail was not as professional. I stand by my original review as it was an honest interpretation of my experience here.

This place advertises as a physical therapy clinic, but they are not. This is a chiropractic office. The staff was generally friendly, although the two ""patient care specialists"" have extremely loud conversations about their personal life while treating patients which is off putting. They advertise to offer pain management, which is also not accurate. I would recommend going to an MD or DO for real pain management treatment. Other than filling out the paper with your pain scale every visit I was never asked how I was feeling or if I was improving. I was rushed through my visits and told to do things like walk on a treadmill while turning my head side to side to help with my post MVA neck pain?? I do not recommend this place at all. I left with more pain than I started with.

He is extremely busy, but he always takes the time to answer questions. If you have a procedure that requires him to go into your spinal canal, which can be scary since there are so many risks, Dr. Walker will explain everything so you know what to expect. He will talk to you throughout the procedure and explain what he is doing, but he also throws in some small talk to help keep you relaxed. I've been a patient of Dr. Walker for almost 10 years and I can't think of a negative thing to say about him. Dr. Walker truly cares about his patients and embodies everything a doctor should be. His front office staff, Sandy, Jade and Rhonda, are also exceptional people. If you have questions between appointments, they don't make you feel like you are bothering them. If they are unable to answer your question or resolve your issue, they will transfer you to the appropriate nurse who can handle your problem. If you have to leave a message, the nurse will actually call you back! Dr. Walker and his team are truly a wonderful group of people.|I don't want any other Dr to do my injections.

He has treated me for trigeminal Neuralgia and back pain and has given me my life back. I cannot put into words the comfort and trust that I feel with him and his staff.

Rude, condescending with no empathy. She should be moved to doesn't require patient contact.  As far as the clinic itself is concerned, front office staff are great. However, there are issues getting my mother's MRI approved by her insurance because the office didn't provide enough information for the insurance company to understand the necessity or importance of said MRI.  I've heard people say Mercy is not the appropriate name as there is no mercy shown. I don't agree completely with that but I will say, that I agree at least 75% with that statement which is so sad as the that was NOT Sister Catherine McAuley's vision. I believe she'd be ashamed today.|I don't like to leave negative reviews for anyone, but I feel like this needs to be brought to someone's attention. I went in yesterday to have a nerve block put in my back. The nurse came out to get me and took me to my room as I entered my room she asked me, what my pain level was as of that moment and I said not bad right now. And the other nurse named Shell walked into the ro and said so you're not in pain today and I said not as much as usual but I am before I could finish my sentence. She responded if you're not in pain why are you here because this isn't gonna work.. (I understand her concern) And before I could explain that I was not experiencing as much pain as I normally do because I had not worked or done anything strenuous. She said we have a high patient volume and if you don't need to see us then why are you here. I work in customer service daily, but I have worked in healthcare in the past she has a horrible bedside manner and and an absolute horrible demeanor. The look on her face was a total disgust.  I wasn't there because I wanted to be. I was there because I needed to be. My pain management doctor from Rolla scheduled me in Springfield because I could get in so much sooner. I almost left and yes, I was probably was a little irritable from not feeling good for the past eight months, but that was totally uncalled for. The rest of the staff was fantastic. They were great, but maybe she needs to find a new profession. Definitely did not come off as a caring, nurturing, consoling nurse that she should be..  we all get stressed and I understand that. There's no need for you to talk to somebody like they are under educated or not on the same level.  Wasn't I was not there asking or seeking pain medication never once have I even asked for that. I sensed that the nurse that brought me back could tell that I was totally disgusted with Shell.  I wish I would've gotten her name because she was amazing. Maybe she just needs some pointers on patient care.|I don't like doing negative reviews. This is not about individual people. Individually, everyone is great. But when my doctor and my PA don't seem to be able to agree on my care, do multiple procedures without any marked success, and then say ""we can refer you to an outside clinic"". YOU ALL ARE THE OUTSIDE CLINIC! I'm a disabled veteran. I CHOSE you all over the VA because I trust you more than the VA. I may have been wrong about that. I've always believed the private sector could do a better job than the government, but Mercy makes the government look efficient and competent by comparison. Absolutely disgusted with the way Mercy operates these days.|Dr. Broadnex is inconsiderate and the rudest doctor I've ever met! I seen Dr. Everson for many years and he was GREAT! He left and that is how Dr. Broadnex came into my life. He refused to give me an mri so my mercy doctor did. When I took results to pain clinic I was told s ince I don't like his care I need to go else where.There is no other place that cares thou  . Now scared to come back. Refuse to see last Dr|My mother got a referral back in July, the first time, this place said they did not recieve it so she had the doctor resend it. 2 weeks later, she called to see if they got it, and they tell her they misplaced it. So the doctor had to send it a third time.  She had to drive 60 miles to get here just to make an appointment. A week later, a day before her appointment, they call her and cancel her appointment. They rescheduled her for 2 weeks out. So she drives another 60 miles, gets there, checks in upstairs, goes downstairs, waits in line for over 5 minutes. She gets to the counter and they refused to see her because she was 3 minutes late to her appointment. This is the most unprofessional, incompetent business I have ever seen in my life. They have no regard for their patients. If I could, I would rate this 0 stars.|This Mercy clinic has the worst insurance coordinators in the entire world. Inept person/persons should be terminated. No excuse for not doing your job.
In pain? No worries! They will keep you that way.|My husband has seen Dr. Benjamin Lampert for several years and is very happy with his treatment plan.  My only regret is that Dr. Lampert is not accepting new patients now that I need treatment.  Also, I need to comment that the many bad reviews posted here have me looking in other places for my pain management needs, since I can't see Dr. Lampert. It's been a hard year for all of us, I know, and pain makes it seem worse.  Maybe we should cut some of these health care providers a bit of slack.  Namaste.

EDIT:  Dr. Lampert has retired.  The doctor my husband saw was not as good as Dr. Lampert.  No relief was obtained from the injections.  This is not the reason my husband will not return to Mercy Pain management.  The reason is that he was not told until just before the injections that no anesthesia would be administered.  He stated it was painful.  Then, he was deposited in the dressing room and told to get dressed.  I was not given the option to be with him to assist him in any way.  The worst part was that the attendant did NOT offer him a wheel chair for discharge.  I saw him stumbling and holding on to the wall as he came out the door.  I held him up and got him to the car.  He said ""just get me out of here.""  That is totally NOT like him.  Because of this experience, we both are patients of the Citizen's Memorial Hospital system now.|I've never had issues with the staff at this clinic. The only issue I have is the hospital decision to no longer sedate for the injections it should be the patients decision. They are extremely painful and  when you experience daily pain you shouldn't have to experience more when it's not necessary.

In this timeframe I have not only come to know her as a very good doctor of mine, but  also a friend. She always take time to listen to you, your concerns your thoughts and how you feel. She always make sure that she's totally understanding what's being said . If she don't nail your pain issues down on your first visit, you can rest assured that she will work through it until you have a satisfiable treatment .  If you're interested Dr.Boutwell can help you with food alternatives for helping with inflammation and such. She has a great supportive staff also,Nicole her assistant is very good at what she does ,She is very friendly and have a great personality .|I love Katalyst. I was seeing another doctor prior to coming here and I'm so glad I switched. Everyone here is so nice, caring, helpful, and supportive and want to find a way to make your pain better.

I have a somewhat complex case and they had so many ideas of different things we can try. 10/10|Dr Boutwell is great. Her approach is inquisitive in nature and solution oriented. One of the best pain management doctors I have encountered. The staff is friendly and helpful, good people.

However, attempting to access documentation related to my care has been utterly laughable. The person handling that request has been absolutely no help whatsoever. A glaring bit of incompetence in an otherwise good clinic.|The staff at Katalyst are so professional and caring you feel as if you are with family. I was led to Katalyst by an attorney as a result of an injury, and I am so grateful. I feel as if God himself laid the path out before me that caused Dr. Boutwell and her staff's lives to intersect mine, because the level of care i have received for CRPS through Katalyst has been otherworldly! They have all been willing to sit down with me and my wife and have talks that other doctors will run from, such as holistic treatment and spiritual matters that can affect a person's recovery and healing. Katalyst pain management and restorative health has been a godsend to my life since my injury, and would assuredly tell anyone in the world if you have been stricken with a pain disorder that booking your first appointment and following up with the folks at Katalyst will change your life for the better as well. I know it to be true, as I am sharing my experience, strength and hopes with you, as I have received nothing but benefits of a healthier life as a result of their level of skill and wisdom in the affairs of restorative health medicine! God bless, and may you find the answers to better living and healing as I have because of Katalyst's employees committment to helping their clients have the best life possible, especially after being given something as horrible as crps as a result of an injury. Thank you Katalyst from the bottom of my heart!|This place rocks. Haven't even gotten my injection yet, and leaving a review. The staff and Doc are awesome... Very nice, personable, and super knowledgeable. Will leave another after my injection.

Injection complete. As suspected they were just as amazing during that part. Explained everything fully, and gave multiple chances for questions.

Would highly recommend if your broken like me to let them do the fixing. I don't even know if the fixed anything but they still get 10 stars.|I LOVE Dr. Boutwell!!  When you have Dr. B, you not only have an excellent and thorough doc, you also have a VERY caring person.  She has been working with my son who was hit by a car.  She found a tear in a disc no one else had noticed.  Her approach and her advice and her friendly nature are priceless!|What can I say other then what a blessing Dr.Boutwell has been on my life. She and her staff are very professional and treat you like family. I have a very complex and difficult neurological issue. I have had several doctors in the past and just hit brick walls. Dr Boutwell goes at it at a very professional and caring level. She truly and honestly does everything in her power to provide me with all the new technologies and advancement in medical field at her finger tips to try and put me in the best position to live as pain free life as I can. She doesn't hesitate to try and use cutting edge stuff and always keeps me informed on what kind of new possible technologies that could be coming down the pipeline. The world could use a few more Dr. Boutwell's. I would recommend anyone who struggles with pain and needs some high quality care to look them up at Katalyst pain management.|Dr. Kaylee Boutwell and her team at Katalyst Pain Management and Restorative Treatment Center have given me an eye opening experience. I shadowed with her team for one week and it was the best shadowing experience I have ever had. I was so intrigued by all the different types of restorative care that I have never heard about and it made me want to possibly pursue a speciality in pain management.

And you don't even have anyone to help them up or down the stairs is showing little compassion in your part. This situation is nothing but accidents waiting to happen. These patients are struggling with pain to begin with and this is adding to their issues. Also your receptionist and her back up seem to lack compassion and organizational skills.

I was told by the Dr. someone would call me within 2 days after my appointment to schedule, that was 2 weeks ago. There are no specific hours on the message lines, you'd think if doctors are referring they would at least have someone answering phones. Do not waste your time! Look elsewhere!!|So pisted they made an appointment with me I waited 3 weeks go in for my appointment and they couldn't find my appointment or my referral so I had to have my stuff faxed over again and they said doctor has to review it before I could be seen it takes 2 seconds to look at it but they said they couldn't see me until doctor looks at it then asks me if it's ok they do injections only after telling me over the phone the doctor does prescribe pain meds that they treated me like a drug addict and not a patient that has severe pain due to being beaten for years and several car accidents my MRI shows arthritis scoliosis and hernated disks. Oh and they told me the wrong building I went to at Francis building then I was told at Joseph's building so all the walking and elevators just put me in more pain plus your first appointment they say is just a consolation it's a waste of time and sounds like they want to milk my insurance I rather see Dr padda who I've been seeing because he takes my pain seriously and does injections chiropractic and psychiatrist oh and nerve burning treatments that help me but my parents wont let me see him and its frustrating because no other pain management takes my pain seriously im constantly rubbing ointment on my back and doing yoga stretches it helps a little but I need my medicine and nerve burning treatments every 6 months|I would have give a minus rating if all possible that is the total of worth of this office since I was referred.  The office staff is Cold, Clueless and  Very Rude.  The last appointment I had the APN was not up to date  with my case, although cordial the APN read my results of the prior appointment and did not see the MRI that I had taken the week before.  Being the type of person I am, I told her that there should be a MRI and results showing the problems that I'm having.  To no avail, she said that they would have to get authorization from my insurance company for a procedure.  Nothing else was discussed and that was the end of my visit.  I have been dealing with my back for the past 16 years as a result of two separate accidents and chronic pain.  I have been through Physical therapy, Massage therapy,  trigger point injections and spinal block without any relief.  I feel that I'm being jerked around and honestly I feel that no one cares. I left the office feeling mentally darined.  My question is would you feel safe having needles stuck into your spine after dealing with this experience? I certainly am not happy with this outcome.|I tried for months to get appointment with this office jumped through all the hoops, put up with delays getting calls returned, two weeks ago they told me that they needed insurance referral and could schedule an appointment. Now today am told docs have reviewed med record and will not see me at all

They will push upfront payment plans that you will have to finance (very unethical & unecessary). I was left with just as much pain after my 3 month program, which I had to continue paying for 2 years. I had the option to continue with even MORE money (excuse me?).
To top it off, my program was supposed to include knee injections that they completely ""forgot"" to do. I noticed after going over my paperwork, so they offered to refund me that portion. Since nothing was itemized, I'm really not sure I got the correct refund.
The chiropractor was nice, but I always felt rushed, like I was moving through stations. The physical therapy was nothing more than printed off exercises I could have done myself.
Most of all- I specifically mentioned that my biggest source of pain was middle back. They seemed to only want to focus on lower back pain & never even X-rayed above my lower back (why???)

Stanley|I love going to this office. Everyone is awesome. I'm so thankful that I started going here. I love NP Rebecca Buchanan, then she sent me to Dr. Orr & he's amazing. Caitlyn Emert is so sweet & hard working. The girls upfront are so friendly. All the staff is great. I would recommend all my friends & family go here.|When you need to see a Chiropractor. Doctor Steven Orr and his staff, Stacey Vitale and Caitlyn Emert are there to assist you in every way possible.  They are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. The office is immaculately equipped and very clean.  They have my highest recommendation.|This is a complete honest truth review!

I spoke with the receptionist lady's and this review has nothing to do with them they are completely nice and helpful with their information as they get it!

This is a review for the doctor who said he would take my referral under self pay then after he gets my referral does not want to take me anymore ""not accepting new patients at this time"" but was told that he was accepting new patients under self pay, this whole review is just to understand why? Why say you will take me but then not take me after you received my referral and all my paperwork? Is it because of my age? Or what? You guys are the closest pain management center to me and by far the cheapest for self pay patients I give you guys credit for that but I will be leaving this review on here until I am taken care of because there is literally no reason I should be told your accepting new patients and all of a sudden your not right after you get my paperwork|I have never been disappointed with the awesome care from Dr. Zilke and Dr. Orr!
The staff is great and caring.

He's an excellent pain management physician and if you have to have injections he is quick and painless in addition to being very kind personable caring physician!|It's so sad sometimes that great doctors are burdened with horrible and disrespectful staff. I appreciated the care and attention Dr. Meek gave and followed through on his recommendations. First, a receptionist left a voicemail saying that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my shoulder (she suddenly became doctor) and even said Dr. Meek said that there was nothing wrong with it even though he was aware of a traumatic history. After recommending I get an MRI on a shoulder bothering me, I attempted to reappoint with him to hear results and move forward. The woman that answered the phone told me that I was suddenly to see a NP, whom I had not ever seen before (I only saw Dr. Meek.) I told her I'd prefer to see the doctor and she told me that he was suddenly unavailable to see me on my days off, Mondays and Fridays. I told her I saw him twice before on Fridays and would like to be accommodated. She said he couldn't see me at the Saint Peters location, kept selecting a Wednesday date, and I asked to be scheduled at the other. She said, no. It was despicable to have to, in 2021, deal with this maltreatment. I took my business to Dr. Lyndon Gross at the Orthopedic Center of St. Louis in Chesterfield, who gladly saw me on a Monday, explained the details of my shoulder injury, recommended treatment, and completed it. No disrespect, no control issues from front desk personnel, just care; all I asked for. Dr. Meek, I believe, is excellent with patient care, but some of the front desk/appointment setters are horrible.|Dr Meek is a Professional, Kind  & truly Gentle & Caring. He has been treating both my Mom & Sister for the past 10 years. My Mom is 90 & fell when she was in her early 80's & broke several vertebrae in her lower back. Dr Meek injected a kind of plastic that took the place of where the bones were. She fell on the deck & broke her right wrist 2 years ago. It was bad. One of the other Dr's at this practice set it Perfectly. She's retired from Arm Wrestling, but is good as new. My Sister has had back problems since she was 18. She was riding & the horse she was riding decided he didn't want to take the jump with her. She's had Injections & other treatments done by Dr Meek over the past 10 years & has helped her improve the quality of her life & it's all worked out Beautifully. And, Dr Coleen Glissen is a VERY Gifted Hand surgeon. She did Carpal Tunnel surgery on both my Sister's wrists & she's OUTSTANDING! The scars are so very small they're unnoticeable. This is THE place to go to for Pain. They are an amazing group of Practitioners & we're fortunate to have them in our Community.|At first, Dr. Meek led me to believe he was there for me.  He even told me he would be the physician I would go to for the rest of my life.  After a few visits it became very obvious he did not have my best interest in mind.  If you are considering this physician for care, you should look elsewhere.|Dr. Meek has an awesome ""chairside"" manner.  I've been seeing and treated by him for lower back pain for almost a year now.  He carefully reviewed and discussed my MRI results with my wife and me.  His  approach to my treatment plan was taken in stages starting from the least aggressive possible. After several pain injections that resulted in good short term but not long term relief his professional ethics dictated that these injections were not beneficial in the long term.  He then suggested a more aggressive treatment called nerve ablation.  After he carefully explained this in office procedure along with its risks and benefits I decided to have him do it.  So now the lower right side of my back has the ablation completed and am now waiting for the next visit for the left. So far so wonderful.  I'm looking forward to much less back pain and the ability to enjoy my grandchildren and everyday life.

At the doctors office one of the nurses is a little rude.. that's why I only gave 4 stars but the doctor is straight to the point and tells you how it is which is what I appreciate. Will definitely trust him and have less anxiety with my other back surgery that I'll be having in the future.|I found that Dr. Lucille was very dismissive. Would come in the office with same concern and would say on three different visits what he was going to do but never followed through on any of it. He did not seem interested whatsoever and what was going on. I was extremely disappointed with his services and his caring of what is going on. He never tried to get to the bottom of what is going on. He did not even scratch the surface to try to understand. I had seen him in the past maybe three years ago Maybe four and when I seen him recently, he did not seem like the same doctor anymore. He seemed like he just did not care and when he would leave the room and you would only talk to him. Maybe five minutes you would sit there and wait thinking maybe somebody would come back in Either him or a nurse but nobody would show up so you would just get up and go. Extremely disappointed with Dr. Lucio and how much he has changed and how he cares for his patience, which seems like he does not care at all. I would definitely not recommend him to anyone and he is supposed to be on the board at Saint Mary's now so maybe that has something to do with it. I do not know but he just does not care about the patient's needs or even their symptoms. Did not help me at all and never followed through with what he said he was going to do on all three visits|Have been suffering from chronic pain for over 15years. I have been a pain management patient for 6 years and have been able to live a mostly pain-free or comfortable since then. I recently moved and was referred to SSM by my doctor in California.
SSM Pain doesn't care about you. They care about making money off you and your insurance company. Since I've already been through all the proceedures and shots they want to give you before they prescribe something to help your pain, they denied treating me. All I need is a prescription. They don't want to waste their time on me, not profitable enough I guess.
Horrible people.|I have been going to Dr Lucio for many years . He has always treated me with great respect and he is a very good Pain management  Dr. He also has the greatest Staff. So caring for the patients just like Dr Lucio he cares and is very concerned  with the patients .  I Recommend  Dr Lucio .|I waited for over an hour to see Dr. Lehman. Then I waited another thirty minutes in the office. The nurse checked my reflexes and asked about my back and neck. She said we are going to get an X-ray of your back and neck. Then left. They did the X-ray pretty fast which was nice. Then Dr Lehman came in another 30 minutes later said my back wasn't operable. He said this is what happens when you get old. Mind you I'm 41. I didn't know that 41 was old. Then he said your range of motion is fine, he didn't lay a hand on me at all!!! How does he know? All they did was a reflex test. I started to talk and he cut me off and said I don't need you to talk only answer my questions. Then he said I'm sending you to pain management and left the room. He was in there for 5 minutes.
After I spent two hours there, I saw the doctor for 5 minutes and the only thing he said was I was old. Then pain management never called. After two weeks of horrible pain, not being able to sleep! I can't sit or stand. I can't bend over, I can't stoop down, I can't sit over ten minutes but Dr Lehman wouldn't know that because he didn't even do an evaluation on me. He didn't even examine me.
After waiting two weeks and pain management never called, I finally went to Columbia Orthopedic Group and saw Dr. Jenkins. My experience was night and day different. Dr. Jenkins is wonderful! He knew by looking at my MRI AND X-RAY (same one that dr Lehman looked at) that I was in bad shape.
He asked me questions, he wanted to know all about my history. He wanted to know what doctor I had seen and who referred me. He wanted to know what medication I was taking. When he found out I have been sick since I was 11 years old he was deeply sympathetic with me! He really cared about me. He made sure I received care that day! He spent 20 to 30 minutes with me in the office. He did send me to pain management and I had an appointment that day. He gave me a diagnosis and explained what he saw in the mri and the X-rays. He also set up a treatment plan moving forward. By the way I only waited four days for an appointment.
When I saw Dr. Lehman there was no treatment plan and I wasn't allowed to talk and he didn't ask me any questions so not much was said. Like I said my diagnosis was, this is what happens when you get old. And that was it!
But I'm only 41 and not many 41 year olds have bulging disc, deterioration in a disc, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, bursitis in your back and hips which is what I was diagnosed by the other doctor and Dr. Newton the pain management doctor! I also was diagnosed with the same thing from my family doctor and my Chiropractor and yet Dr. Lehman's only response was this is what happens when you get old.|I've been suffering from chronic back pain for over a year.  In the last few months it had gotten to point where I could barely walk.  I had tried physical therapy and chiropractic and even had been to another pain management specialist.  Dr  Nathan Kenyon changed all that in the very first treatment.  I went from barely able to stand or walk one day to being almost pain free the day after the treatment.  I can't express my gratitude enough. Dr Kenyon truly cares about his patients.  His staff is also truly amazing. Very friendly and attentive to my needs.  They made me feel very comfortable.|I don't write many reviews but I feel both of the doctors I seen deserve all the credit they can get.
I'm 35 years old female and I was suffering from a pinched nerve it was going down my back and my left leg into my foot for 7 months. I was in constant pain everyday. I could hardly walk, sleep, sit, climb stairs or do anything. I kept thinking it would eventually go away on it's own but it kept getting worse. It was the worst pain I ever experienced. I went to a doctor in my small town and there wasn't much they could do but send me everywhere else. So I got a referral to go to SSM health to see Dr. Lehman he was a great Dr. he reviewed my MRI & told me what needed to be done.
I told him I would rather try the lumbar epidural steroid injection instead of surgery. He agreed we could try that and referred me to pain management to see Dr. Kenyon. I got my appointment set up and later went back to see Dr. Kenyon he went over everything with me and gave me the lumbar epidural steroid injection the same day. I feel great now! I can sleep and walk again. I'm no longer in pain at all so far. They are both really great Doctors and the staff is great too they was all very kind and caring. I will choose to go to them if this ever happens to me again. 5 stars for all of them! I highly recommended them!|I was a patient of Dr Rodgers for about 20 years.  He recommended Dr Lehman. My spine problems are organic, not from injuries.
So when I was injured in a car accident, I called Spine and Pain Management.  They got me in to see Dr Lehman the very next day.  Wonderful! Dr Lehman was polite and took great care to inspect my injuries by ordering a CT scan and MRI after reviewing the x-rays he'd ordered.  That was the last contact I had with Dr Lehman.  I think he is a good physician from what I've experienced.
However, when I was given results from my x-rays, MRI and CT scans I was given two totally different diagnoses.
Dr Lehman also told me that he would see if my injury was caused by the car accident I was in three days prior to my visit.
When his PA called he said I had a fractured  vertebrae and it could be surgically repaired. When I called for clarification if it was most likely from the car accident, the person who called me back told me there was no fracture, I didn't need surgery, it would heal on it's own.

I wasn't given Dr Lehman' s opinion on the likely cause of my injury until they said I could no longer be their patient.
Additionally, the PA saw I was wearing crocs and informed me they had latex in them.  So there was no way I had a latex allergy.  I also called to make sure my chart reflected my latex allergy.
My contacts with the office and this review is to insure no other patients are treated so poorly by the staff.",2025-01-23|2025-01-05|2024-10-15|2023-10-15|2022-09-12|2019-09-20|2020-07-01|2018-08-10,4|1|1|5|1|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Can you request an appointment online?","Yes, visit our website to fill out a form to request an appointment.

Very cordial and friendly.  Well organized staff that works together. Haven't had as well explained processes, treatments and examination from any health care provider before.  Same day imaging and I liked the ""board like"" review of all cases from different disciplines.  Looking forward to their diagnosis.|My experiences  at PC medical have always been phenomenal in treating my medical needed adjustments  over many years , a bone spur in my heel , and my trigger point areas of pain in my shoulder areas, recently  with a trigger point injection. I can be tremendously hurting when I walk in there office ..., And feel like I could go out dancing  later that evening ,  after an adjustment. I tell  Dr. Andrews and the whole world ,  that he has  ""magical hands"" ,, that I can't live without.  After four surgeries I've had on my back,  shoulder and neck from a serious fall down my home stairs 26 years ago    PC medical doctors and staff Are the most caring and professional with there chosen treatments for myself... and they keep me on my feet and living life to the fullest !!! I would never make it without ALL of them  !!!!|I visited them for my first initial assessment on November 14, 2024. You would have thought I had been going there for some time. I couldn't have been treated any nicer if I had been the president. Staff there are second to none. They were very friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.|I would recommend anybody in pain to go to PC Medical Centers. They think outside the box on the normal way pain is managed.  They actually care and want you to feel at your best.  I found them on my own by searching the Internet. The doctors just wanted to push pills and that would just satisfy the pain not fix it.  I'm very blessed to have them taking care of me. I feel apart of their team.|I spoke with the chiropractor and neurologist and while he didn't tell me what all to expect. The free consultation is there so you can show the experts and I believe he said there's a 12
person team, but I honestly can't remember. The whole office works as a team to come up with a plan for you and you make an appointment a week later and that gives everyone to look at
what was found out during the consultation, and come up with a game plan and to make sure your insurance covers it. My Aunt Vicky Olson swore by them saying it changed her life. I'm skeptical just because no one has given me any hope before but Dr. Adam's did and that's more than any other Dr. has given me. So while I don't
know what lies ahead for me, I'm excited next week to find out what It is because every doctor that I've seen in the past always said it's too far advanced or too far gone and I have a feeling I won't get that answer with PC Medical Center. I'd be more than happy to post another review in a few months to see how I'm doing. Thank You|The team at PC Medical are awesome. They're like a loving tight knit family and they extend that courtesy to their patients.
