She has a caring heart and is the true example of a nurse and what a nurse should be!|I have never had a better experience with any doctor like I have with Dr. Nesbitt.

Explained everything to me about my pain. Took time with me and seemed very concerned about my problem. I feel appreciated for choosing them. The office staff was very professional and pleasant. It's strictly business over here. It's not grumpy employees where everyone seemed overworked and under payed, which maybe a possibility but the employees seemed to know how to stay focus on their job and stay prosistent. So far so good.|I was sent to Dr Barlow for scalene block.  Let me just say best staff.  All the staff members were compassionate and caring.  Dr Barlow took time with me prior to my procedure to go over it with me in detail.  He had already reviewed my referral in depth and the back ground history.  I was very impressed.  It is so hard these days to find caring compassionate Dr that listen, and actually want help patients get back to the best quality of life. He understood my goals and he made sure I understood purpose of the block.  He was very encouraging as well.  If I ever have to go back to see him or have the opportunity to recommend, I would do so in a heart beat.  I was not a number nor ""just another patient"",  I was someone he wanted to help.  That's what matters and you just don't see that today. So thank you Dr Barlow and your team!  Keep doing what you all do!  Keep making a difference, and not just physically!|I have been a patient since 2010. Everyone is professional, kind and sincere. Dr. Barlow is excellent! He listens and really sees me as a person, not just a patient. He always asks about my family and that means a lot. Allison see's me in between my visits with Dr. Barlow. She's always professional, empathetic and she also listens. Listening to a patient is crucial in Dr. Patient relationships. We then together decide which path to take. A couple of years back I had a heart attack right when I got to the office. I couldn't ask to be in better hands than all the staff that helped me, talked to me, encouraged me. Anyone that needs pain management, I highly recommend Nesbitt Pain Associates. I from personal experience can honestly say you will be very happy with your decision.

I wish I could remember names, I know Lauren, Kayla, and another nurse that starts with a ""K"" perhaps, were a few of the ladies who helped take good care of me. Thanks to all who were so kind and got me through the day!|My experience was very unpleasant. First off, i live an hour from this place. this isnt even a clinic or office. Its a small (6th)floor of a hospital that uses actual hospital rooms. The atmosphere was unsettling. I arrived on time however, it took me 8 mins to find a parking spot and to actually get to the 6th floor. The nurse was so rude to me, smirking a making rude comments about me being late that they probably wont see me but i could wait if i wanted to be worked in. The 3 women that do the paperwork and reception were all ugly and rude to me. Im there to get an epidural in my neck. Thats it.  But, they treated me like i was garbage. After 2 hours of patiently waiting i calmly got up and left. I hope noone else gets treated so poorly by so called professionals.|Great spine doctor I have gotten cortisone shots , epidural and Rf ablations have had amazing results and been 100% better than my back condition before and has worked mabye as 10 yr of visits.  I had gone to ER in a wheelchair.
Definitely the best Orth/Spine doctor I have seen my selted surgeon I selected recommend him. Ohh and I take zero pain meds now. Just the procedures alone did rhe trick and o take muscle relaxers.|I only met the doctor for a couple minutes before I went under for a procedure. I was very nervous, but he and his nurses were very calm, polite, and reassuring. I had no bad experiences, but did have to wait 2.5 hours before even going back to begin prep. I go back in a month for the same procedure, and I now know that I'm in good, capable hands with their team.",2025-02-21|2024-04-27|2025-02-15|2025-02-26|2024-09-20|2025-02-27|2025-02-19|2024-11-15,5|5|5|5|5|1|5|4,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","What Do You Do If You Have A  Appointment For The 17 At 7:30 In The Morning.","Be on time.",short_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJQ_X0TVETYogRSOqdh8TbPNw,1731

The office staff is also very professional. From scheduling, check in, and throughout my visits, the team is really helpful and pleasant.  It is important to me to know details on everything I take. If I have questions I never feel like a bug, they take time to explain the answers thoroughly and I leave knowing the answers.

He doesn't just throw medicine at you he actually wants to find out why you have the pain.  He is compassionate and kind. He is the best!! His staff are also kind and respectful. So happy I was referred there!!!|In the sixteen years I have been disabled I have never recommended a doctor until now. Finally a doctor who understands the depth pain affects a patient's life. Never have I encountered a doctor as thorough as Dr. Thacker. No question did Sandra at front not answer without knowledge and a smile. Charlene, Kelly, Sandra, Kristen and other nurses are superb.

He will talk to you about your pain and not be in a hurry to get to the next patient. He is helping me with something that is not related to why I am under his care. Cannot wait for this one. If you are in pain and can prove why you are in pain he will help you. He is not like other pain doctors that only care about how much money they can get from you. He does not treat you like a number but as a patient and a Dr. that cares. I would recommend him to anyone.|Dr Thacker is great. Excellent. His support staffing is horrendous. Scheduling is a joke. I truly like the doctor. He is very informative and knowledgeable. But sitting in a lobby chair for a hour. Especially when you are there specific for having a broken back and extensive hardware. Makes the wait in those chairs unbearable.torture. if you are a sufferor of degenerative disc disease you know exactly what I mean.updateI have since returned to using this practice. Everything I mentioned was corrected. The lady that was so rude is no longer there. And everyone is back to friendly smiling faces. Great job to Huntsville Pain Management.|Dr Thacker and Charlotte are AMAZING!! They get 5 stars!!! Have alot of Orthopedic issues and a Digestive disease problem and the treatment is working very well. My ankle was almost severed off years ago from a car wreck. 8 surgeries later and the pain never completely went away. Just lived with it. Dr. Thacker did an injection treatment on it today and it was a miracle. The pain is non existent at the moment and im not hobbling around in pain. I am feeling so much better ever since i started as a patient of his. He has an excellent bed side manner and cares what you have to say and listens to all your concerns and takes his time. The downfall is the nurses will rush him out of the room. If it was subtle and not noticicle it wouldnt be so bad. But its not. But Excellent Doctor, Excellent Practice and good people.

It was a wonderful experience. Every staff member we encountered was kind and compassionate to us. Each person spent a great deal of time speaking with us in order to understand her needs. I would definitely recommend this pain center.|The whole staff was A+++ to me. All very courteous and respectful. Answered all my questions in a polite way. Dr Willis and his team were very competent in the way they treated me with the diagnostic injections and the ablation procedure. I will definitely continue to use them for my pain management and will recommend them to family and friends. The ablation procedure for me was a big success! No more day to day pain and have returned to all the activities that i enjoy. I can't thank Dr Willis and his team enough for how much better my life is now. Thank you very much!!|Dr Mark Willis is truly a good caring doctor. He reviews all instructions and ask questions about any changes.His PA Morgan Barton works diligently to see you have all you need to ease your pain. Highly recommend. I've been his patient about 6 years.|I've been a patient for years and have many health issues. Thank you so very much Southeast Health Pain Management for listening to my health concerns and treating me accordingly. Dr. Mark Willis and NP Michelle M. Chandler genuinely care about their patients. The nurses always make me feel welcome and always address any concerns I have even between appointments. The staff is quick to call back and address any issue I have or answer any questions I may have. I would def recommend this office. Thanks again!|I want to give a complete and honest review. To be fair, the receptionists and Dr. Willis are fantastic! I really liked him and I'm sad that I have to find a new doctor. The reason for the review is because of one of Dr. Willis' nurses. At my last appointment, she severely overstepped and tried to ""scold"" me. Even the nurse practitioner said that she overstepped and handled it. However, the same nurse was rude again today. I have severe anxiety, which is in my medical records, and she makes me feel very uncomfortable. All I wanted was an apology and we could have moved on. But instead, it was easier to just send me to another doctor. Which is fine. If she couldn't lower herself to apologize for her mistake, then I do need to go somewhere else. But again, I love Dr. Willis and his nurse practitioner, even though she was short with me today as well, so if you want to see him, my advice is to just keep the interactions with the nurses short and to the point.|Dr. Willis an his staff are the best an we love them. Very professional,  courtesy, an always on point with our Medical care...|It was my husband's first visit to SH Pain Management but everyone was very nice. The initial visit, tests and consultation was three and a half hrs but the time went quickly. Dr McRae and his staff are very nice and professional. Brandy did a great job doing all of the initial intake information followed by Dr McRae.|I love Dr. David Evans. He is so thorough in his evaluation, and he has a great bedside manner and a very great personality. He has helped manage my pain greatly! He is excellent in doing epidurals in my back. He has never hurt me, and he talks to you during them, so it makes me forget that he is putting a needle in my back. Definitely recommend him! His nurse Carmen, she is super awesome too!

They created a patient portal, but never responded to any of my concerns via the portal or in person. I just received a termination letter for inappropriate behavior. The only thing I see is that they are saying that I should know my place and allow them to handle me the way they want and not have a voice. No, I'm not going to have back procedures that's not working, just to pad your pockets. Yes, I'm going to question the discrepancies of my payments, inaccurate information and to point out why you guy's never address my concerns. Some of them are cordial, but some aren't. I would say they need to get it together, but that's maybe what got me released. Plus, I'm no longer a patient there. So, it doesn't matter.|I've been a patient with PPA , Dr. Frenette and now Dr. Hardin ( before and after cancer)since 2018  and I always feel that I'm "" listened"" to and helped to the best of ANY physician's ability. I LOVE that I don't have to be put to sleep for nerve blocks and my last steroid injection has lasted almost a year. I highly recommend them if you are seeking QOL improvement . Chronic pain is that.....chronic, debilitating and depressing , so it helps to have physicians, nurses  and staff who believe you and do the best they can to understand and help .... and they do!! (I love Dr. Hardin!).|Tried making an appointment, as they are ""in network"" on my insurance and I was told they are not seeing people on that exact plan. I called my insurance and they assured me that they are in my network, meanwhile I, the consumer, are stuck in the middle. Either have your name removed from the in network providers or start seeing patients. STOP PUTTING PEOPLE IN MEDICAL NEED , IN A ENDLESS MAZE.|So I was a patient for about 3 years if not more.  Went in today and was told they were terminating me because I missed appts.  Truth be told, I was scared to have the nerves burnt in my back.  Horrible horrible the way they did this.|Even though I got all the referrals I needed, they would not see me because my surgery is too close, 2 weeks away. So I guess I'll just have to go buy pain pills on the street if my hip starts giving me severe pain again, literally was in the worst pain I've ever been in a couple weeks ago, and I have severe crohns disease so i know pain, but can't get anything to manage it because they'll give me pain stuff at the hospital, 2 weeks from now. Absolute garbage service and care , will never recommend to anyone.|I went to this place for a couple years and kept telling them that I was getting worse. If they would have listened they would have figured out earlier that I have an autoimmune disease. It took a simple blood test. And when I told them how I was feeling no advice was given on how to go about getting help or finding out what was wrong.|I previously had a doctor that ignored my request for an MRI, with me telling every student NP, NP, and the doctor that owned the brand new facility he built when he had several other doctors working with him. All of sudden there's no other MD's except he and his wife, who was never in the office but somehow managed to sign prescriptions. I was accused of doctor shopping by DHR because they only sign prescriptions with the same NP or student twice to stay off the review boards radar, however I suffered for their diligence to protect their license.
They never disclosed that taking the medication they prescribed would prevent me from taking anything but it permanently, because Medicaid doesn't pay for off book medication, what they did amounts to fraud by definition in addition to negligence and misdiagnosis.

PPA EVERY TIME I SEE THEM I SEE AN MD, they listen, they take your feedback into consideration and do their best to give you the treatment that will help the most, if you're not willing to follow those recommendations, you're not in enough pain to be in a pain clinic.

If it had not been for my common sense telling me that I'm on a walker now and the previous doctor and clinic didn't even take X-rays forget an MRI. I went to the ER and was immediately rushed into the OR at UAB, and then required a second emergency surgery in less than 48 hours. I was hospitalized for over 2 weeks because of the previous doctor.

DR.HARDIN AND DR.FRENETTE HAVE LISTENED,PERFORMED DIFFERENT PROCEDURES AND DO THEIR BEST TO LISTEN AND MANAGE YOUR SYMPTOMS.THEY ARE NOT A PCP,THEY ARE SPECIALISTS AND PRESCRIBING ANY MEDICATION OR PERFORMING ANY TEST OUTSIDE TJAT SCOPE YPUR INSURANCE WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT COVER AND YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COST. JUST BECAUSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR ARE IGNORANT OF HOW MEDICAL OFFICES OPERATE IS NO REASON TO TAKE IT OUT ON TJE DOCTORS WHO SPECIALIZE.IF YOU NEEDED A BLOOD TEST,YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE THERE FIRST,NOT A PAIN CLINIC.

THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY DO AT PPA, NOR DO THEY DO ANY ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTICS,OUTSIDE THEIR SCOPE,
OR ATTEMPT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE MOST LIKELY IT WOULD VIOLATE THE TERMS OF INSURANCE. THEY ARE HERE TO MONITOR AND MANAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE POST OP NOT SUGGEST WHAT OPERATION OR TEST TO FIND YOUR PROBLEM. YOU SHOULD NOT EVEN BE THERE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS....

Dr. Telang has been working with me for several months to help alleviate some of my pain. I had the RFA on my lower back Nov. 1, 2024, and I have seen at least an 80% improvement in my pain levels and range of motion since then.

I am very blessed to be receiving care from such a great facility.|Amazing. The ONLY Dr, in over 20 years who actually listened to me, performed the proper tests, and has helped me tremendously.

If you are a military vet, he works with community care as well. I can not recommend Dr. T and his staff enough. I will forever be grateful for the pain relief he has given me.

Dr Telang and his staff are absolute professionals from scheduling, billing and always friendly. Dr Telang is busy but he always takes the time to listen to my questions and concerns and helps me understand the treatment and prognosis. Again, highly recommend Dr Telang. Wish I'd found him years ago.|I have been a patient since moving to Florence in 2018.  I didn't know about pain specialist, but asked on FB for a doctor in Florence, who could help me with my back pain.  Dr. Telang was recommended and I quickly made an appointment.  He has helped me so much, in fact I was in a rear-end accident in which my back became worse. Another injury I received from this accident was whiplash. This whiplash is constant, every time I turn my head pain shoots up into my skull.  Injections in the neck have helped this also.
Last year I was talking to a guy that was at a tailgate party and I saw he was in great pain.  He told me his surgeon recommended surgery.  I had two back surgeries and I could advise him how difficult the recovery was and I was still in great pain.  I told him about Dr. Telang and the guy actually made an appointment.  I saw the guy Oct 7, 2013, after not having talked to him for a year.  He told me Dr. Telang had helped him tremendously.  He was so glad to have gone to Telang.

Therefore, if you don't know, you cannot even beging to explain as to why. My levels were apparently not correct and one of my DTs was off. No one told me until FOUR MONTHS LATER. They continued to fill my prescriptions. Then some very snarky, woman called me, Pam... And accused me of doing METH and FENTANYL!!!
She told me to come to the office the following day to re-test. I did, she comes in the room and hands me a dismissal sheet. And REFUSED TO RETEST ME.
And discharged me.

My husband then called the owner because I was SOBBING because I had JUST gotten my job back and back on my feet from dealing with debilitating pain that TOOK MY FRIGGIN LIFE FROM ME!!!

ONLY THEN DID THEY SEND MY DRUG SCREEN OFF FOR FURTHER TESTING. NOTHING WAS IN MY SYSTEM EXCEPT FOR MY PRESCRIPTION MEDS.

The owner apologized. But after that, nope. I won't go back.

Pam is NOT nice. They REFUSE to admit that they're human beings too and make mistakes. I understand they have to be tough but they don't have to be HATEFUL and ASSUME EVERYONE IS AN ADDICT.

If you're a patient here, just please be careful and have a back up plan in case Pam decides to get a wild hair one day and ruin your life.

I will say that Dr. Kelsey's nurse is the ONLY person in that clinic who is kind. She had no problem answering any questions, or just hearing me out with my concerns. It's a shame that office is bringing her down.
I pray she finds a Doctors office who will appreciate her and give her the respect she deserves.

Thanks|My name is actually Lisa Zopfi-Houston Bambi is my nickname. I am a pump patient and Dr Doleys has bent over backwards to keep me my pain level down. I have a very unusual situation and have been through alot since coming to the Doleys Clinic. I really really feel he cares. Anne my pump nurse has been a life saver. As a retired nurse myself I have never met a nurse that cares more than she does. No matter what struggles she has gone through in her own life she never EVER let it show in her day to day. Since Dr Hill has left it has been more difficult for them, however both of them are trying so hard to help their patients,  even if it means staying until all hours of the night.I may have to leave due to insurance issues and it breaks my heart. I have grown to feel like my pain team has become part of my family. I don't know if I will get the amount of true love and care that I receive from Dr Doleys and Anne. Please believe me when I tell you they really really care!!!!!!!|I have been going to Dr Dolays clinic  for 30years, I was a total mess before coming to the clinic. After they got me where I should be , I have lived a better life , thanks to them . You are treated like a human and your pain is their pain !! They take time to listen to my needs , and they do everything possible to make my life better . Being disable is  no fun and games , it changes your whole life , but you have to make the most of it , and learn to live with it , Uplift has been a God send to me , before I may have only gotten a few hours sleep, but now I take it and sleep like a baby !!! Thanks Nick & Dr Dolays for your concern for me and my pain!!!! The staff is great and Ms Ann is wonderful, she listens and cares to all my needs !!! Please continue to take care of me, so I can be as  normal as I can !!!!|If I had to post a review prior to Dr. Hill's retirement, it would have been 5 stars. Since Dr. Hill left, I have been reduced in my pain medication that I have been taking since 2011. I've never ran out before it was due, never had to use Narcan, never had been rushed to a hospital or overdosed. It is because the DEA now has become my doctor. First it was Dr. CDC and now it is Dr. DEA. For those of you, staff and patients, who would like to be well informed of the patients struggles, please join pain groups on Facebook. At least there are some physicians that will fight against this atrocity. Although my last name shows up as Rawlins on Facebook, it is Townsend. Please check some groups out. There are many that try to fight the government from becoming our physicians.|I have been a chronic pain patient for many years and The Doleys Clinic is one of the best pain clinics I have ever encountered.  The staff has been very helpful.  Dr. Hill is very compassionate and understanding.  He works hard to understand your concerns and help you achieve your goals and give you the best quality of life he can.  Dr. Dolce listens well and explains thoroughly his thoughts about your care.  I feel Blessed to have found The Doleys Clinic!|Sending me to The Doleys Clinic was one of the best things my physician has done for me.   I have experienced only positive,  professional interactions with any of the staff with whom I have had the pleasure of dealing.  I have been treated courteously, and with kindness & compassion.  I feel as though any concerns I present are heard and all reasonable efforts are made to address them.  One thing that is great is that I have very rarely EVER had to wait for more than thirty (30) minutes, if even that long, to  be seen.

I am deeply grateful for all of you at The Doleys Clinic.   God bless you all.|Update May 2024- I am no longer a patient due to Dr. Hill retiring so information below may be outdated. The clinic did try to help me find another physician in the area- None of those worked for me but I was able to transition to another provider without trouble.

This has been an amazing and wonderful experience with pain management. I was at a different clinic previously and was being backed into a corner to agree to a procedure for my rare condition. I was not comfortable with this and many other things and decided to seek a second opinion. I chose the Doleys clinic since I was seeing one of their pain psychologists already and I am so glad I decided to see Dr. Hill. He has truly treated my pain management plan like a collaboration. He listens to my story, seeks to understand my rare diagnosis, and we work TOGETHER to decide on my plan of care. I am not pressured into procedures I am not comfortable with. So far, my pain management plan is working and giving me my life back. Thank you so very much for treating me with respect and as a trustful adult.|I have been coming to the Doleys clinic for over ten years . I have always been treated with respect and kindness.they have helped me threw some very difficult times in my life both physical and mental.Dr Hill is one of the kindest people I have ever met and nurse Tiffiny is very thorough and kind. I have had two hip replacements two knee replacements two broken wrists at the same time that had to be rebuilt.so when I say I could not have made it with out them I mean it.also my husband has been coming for two years after two neck surgeries I would just like to thank everyone at the clinic from the office staff who checks me in keeps my husbands and my appointments straight to the nurses that take your blood pressure and administer  your drug testing.

The worst pain management I've ever dealt with in 3 states.

So, issue was worked out. But I guess the poor staff lady that got butthurt over me not paying for their mistake or the fact their texts are incorrect and having x days with insurance to schedule rides. Tried to charge me no show fee. Got it handled being misunderstanding all around. After the initial review. Was given the text yesterday. Today it's canceled because of original review. But, they couldn't call back as they claimed they would. Obviously, it wasn't a misunderstanding. They are that unprofessional.|I am Judy Cleveland and have been having procedures at your facility multiple times and have always been treated with the upmost care and professional ways, on January 17 2025 I wanted to commend Natalie and Jennifer who were the two among others of course, but they were just great.  Thank you for this, Natalie and Jennifer.|Was raised on a ranch in Montana, I believe we treated our cattle with more respect and compassion than this place. They run you through like cattle, they don't give a         Sh--- about you, if you think they are going to listen to you about how you're feeling you better think again.I think that they are the Rudest people that I've had the pleasure of dealing with.|I am giving a 3 STAR today because I have been reading the reviews and to be honest they kinda scare me. I will also be updating as well after my appointment with them to fix or to complete my review. I have always said a GOOD DR WILL LISTEN TO his PATIENTS. ( because not that we know more then them or better then them .... )
BUTTTTTTR====== = WE (PATIENTS) live in our bodies, use, our body. Feel our bodies day in day out we know what works , was hasn't,  what doesnt... if (IF) they would take the time to hear us out for once maybe the (WHOLE MEDICINE) Situation's for everyone  even the ( DR'S) would get better.
Not only Dr's at fault but maybe if us patients would be more kinder, ans understanding, and polite to the NP, and Dr as well maybe there wouldn't be so much Controversy towards one another for judging each other in the first place. MEDICINE alone would get better for EVERYONE IN THE WORLD for people like me and so many others that I just read about on this site ( . Sad   )
I pray that when I go in for this appointment that none of this stuff I've have read is true. But stay toned I will be posting an update. Hope everyone stays blessed and gets blessed everyday with Love S.S.C|Charged me $257 I paid my $50 copay to even speak to the doctor. Sat in waiting room for 4hrs missing work even WITH an appoinment. DIDNT DO XRAYS - TOLD me to go to my primary and get those really- thats more copay and time.  I talked with doctor (not naming names) for 10 minutes and 5min. of that was him stroking his own ego, talking about how he works outand noone ever guesses his age (like I cared). DO NOT GO HERE. While Cullman Is growing - the doctors & hospital care in Cullman is still stagnant and overpriced. You could get more out of a teledoc appointments. EVeryone knows if you in bad shape dont go to Cullman. Well it s getting bad when ypu cant even use them for the occasional life happens primary care either. BTW they keep sending me a $ 95 bill saying I still owe for services rendered. I feel like after missing work and listening to the so called doc talk on and on, I should send them my own invoice.|The staff is rude they make fun of patients very loudly where people in the waiting room can hear them they treat patients like they own them.
Dr is ok but their rules should be for everyone including their staff. I will not recommend them to a worm let along a person. I will be complaining to the medical board an my insurance . They should be shut down I've never been in a dr office with this many night mares. An they dismiss you for the smallest things. They are horrible people.|I love Dr Tubbs he is a great doctor!!! His NP is also great!! He has a new NP and she is awful she is hateful she don't listen it's her way or no way. She cut my pain meds from 100 to 90 and the next appointment she cut from 90 to 75.

He would literally scream in pain and could not perform the most basic of functions by himself (putting on clothes, brushing teeth,  etc.) After trying meds and an epidural, Dr. Shikh suggested the spinal stimulator. The trial worked well, so we went for the real thing and it changed my husband's life. He is now pain free, no meds and can do nearly everything he could before the scar tissue formed. We could not be more pleased with Dr. Shikh and his staff and they work they did. They are the best!!!!|I am afraid the low reviews found on Valley Pain Clinic Reviews are from patiences wanting pain pills . The Doctor is very careful about getting people addicted! My insurance also covered all cost so that may be a factor as well .
I was diagnosed on my very first visit , my medial branch nerves were shooting unbearable pain , just getting out of bed caused me to scream ! I could not have therapy , The Pain level out the roof !  I had to have these nerves deactivated by ablation . The pain had stopped before I left the surgery center .
I am now getting therapy, strengthening my back muscles . I had  one year of being inactive due to pain , now I can get the therapy I needed without pain . I highly recommend if nerve pain is your problem .
I didn't want to live my life on pain pills , I wanted the problem fixed . I have high expectations that when and if these nerves grow back my back will be strong enough and will not let the medial never call the shots ! I say Amen ! This was my only solution for getting out of pain .|BEST PAIN DOCTOR IN NORTH ALABAMA .  WILL. NOT. GIVE YOU. PILLS UNLESS YOU NEED THEM. !!!
PROBABLY REASON FOR BAD REVIEWS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET PILLS. !!!!
HE AND HIS STAFF ARE THE BEST!!!|I have been going here for a few months : costed quite a bit to get X-rays at the local hospital to prove my conditions. It seemed to be what I needed to get medication to control my pain . However the third visit became complicated from extreme high charges for drug screen . They were charging my insurance 160.for drug screen . Of course my provider would not pay this ridiculous amount therefore they charged me for the difference . So I spoke with a male person in the office and he assured me that from that point on when a drug test was done I would be charged only 65.00 ok so I agreed . Continued with there team . Now today when I went in they had a lot of charges along with another 160.00 charge for drug screen . Also two charges for no show .there was two times I had to reschedule because of being out of town . I followed protocol and called days before my appointment to reschedule . There policy I signed when I started with this office required 24 hour notice to not be charged as no show this was met . They wanted me to sign for charges and I refused , they gave me a paper to sign to state I was quoting there service . I refused to sign and to them I was only refusing to sign until they corrected the no show charges and honored the 65.00 drug screen . It appears people that are in need of help and or scamming for drugs : are the people that this pain clinic feeds on by overcharging and incorrect charges known no they will pay anything to get drugs . Lol not me yes I need help but not going no to be hassled for charges that are incorrect. I will be calling the state board to further my compliant . Can't help but believe this is happening a lot . Every time I go there the same complaints are at the desk from other patients . This pain management needs to be shut down . I will do all in my power to see that it does shut down or at least be investigated to stop the theft of our hard earned money . If I am wrong then it will have to be proved to me . Thank you for taking time to review my complaints|I am very concerned about this office's prescribing practices. I am a nurse with AL Dept of public health. I have two family members that have been patients there for many years. One gets monthly fentanyl patches along with percocet 10s, the other gets 110 percocets a month. They both live in the same household . There is a high risk of overuse and sharing that is well known nationwide. Most offices will not do this. I will be investigating further|I have been coming to see Dr. Shikh since 2006. I have Multi Level DDD.  I have Spinal  Stenosis.  I have a Ruptured Disk and Bulging Disk. I also have Bone Spurs. I have  have had different types of medication. I have had joint injections.  I have had Epidural injection. I was told by Dr. Shikh that if I  never have any pain then I was on to much medication.  I am now at the point where I have to have a Spinal fusion. I  will still have to go back to Dr. Shikh. I love everyone there. The staff is so sweet . Dr. Shikh does do random drug screening so you better be very strict with your medicine. He will not replace lost prescriptions  with out a police report. Dest pain management doctor there is. Definitely not a pain mill

You won't be sorry for going here!|We had our first appointment with the clinic and were very pleased. The staff were so friendly and caring. The doctor was very professional explaining options for treatment and in a way we could comprehend. It was a very pleasant appointment and gave us a lot of hope for treatment options!!!  So ready for this journey of healing and comfort.  Thank you to all the staff.|I'll definitely only use them for my pain clinic. It was my first time here and they are Amazingly Friendly, Knowledgeable, and seem to really care about their patients. Doc took time to go over everything and explained it all in layman's terms. So refreshing to have someone who actually listens. I'd give 10 stars if it would let me.|I've had 2 visits, and they were extremely opposite.
I think the difference was how busy they were. On the 1st visit, they were extremely busy. While I do appreciate not having my wait reflection on how busy they were, I didn't appreciate not being able to complete any of my sentences on the questions.
On the 2nd visit, they weren't as busy. The nurse was very, very nice. Like the nicest one I've seen in 10 years. Her name began with an S.. maybe Sandra, mmm.. not sure. I'd love to give her credit here. Dr. was the same, very nice.
If both visits were that nice, I'd give 4 stars. Unfortunately, I almost didn't go back after that 1st one.
I think it's very sad reading these reviews where people are saying it's nice to be treated like a human. If that doesn't say we need healthcare improvements. It is nice to be treated like a human. I will say I was treated like a human except for those minutes I wasn't. I was treated like a number for a few minutes. When I say I couldn't complete a sentence, I mean that literally. But I didn't see that nurse there on this 2nd visit so she might not even still be there and I feel sure it was because of the amount of patients there.  I would reconsider my review if my next visit is as good as this last one.",2025-02-21|2025-01-23|2025-02-20|2025-02-27|2025-02-19|2024-11-13|2025-01-23|2025-02-20,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|3,,,"1 p.m.|12 p.m.|9 a.m.",81.6|77.8|74.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do u take walk in's?","I think they do, but you don't have to be referred.

I found Michelle(if I remember correctly) to be very caring, knowledgeable & professional.  Wait times were greatly reduced.  I have been a patient for a few months & am very satisfied & happy with the Staff & Providers.  Everyone is friendly yet professional and I feel as though I matter to this practice.  My pain is well controlled with only as necessary medications.|They had me excited my first visit. The Dr made me feel like it was important to not only find the problem(m) but the solution(s). Plans were made to have a more recent MRI. A nerve block was scheduled for Feb 2nd. I had a sense everyone had listened & we were all on the path to me being able to function again with a life. Sounds great, right? Keep reading.........

It took me a yr to get to a pain clinic of which I thought was the start of regaining my life back. I spent a yr reading reviews, asking friends, getting referrals before finally choosing AAPC. I'd spent 3+ yrs pushing through pain levels I never thought possible.  I had pushed through for over 5+ yrs without any narcotics. Now my pain is so extreme I'm having difficulties standing, walking, driving to Dr appts, the pharmacy, grocery stores, cooking, doing chores or daily activities such as bathing & dressing. I'M NOT FUNCTIONING OR PUSHING THROUGH ANYMORE & I'm not ashamed to admit it. So now let's get to what happened my second visit. A visit that I was so excited to go to after my 1st visit.

I'm guessing it was two nurse practitioners that came in separate times. But I'm not certain since they never introduced themselves. They asked the typical follow up questions. Quickly I was told my prescriptions had been sent to my pharmacy. That's when I asked would I see the Dr today & I was assured I would. What I had been prescribed my 1st visit still left me crippled in pain.

Remember I'm at desperate mode for relief when I entered 6wks earlier. I didn't call & complain the meds weren't working. I assumed the time to discuss this would be at the next appt. The girl said , let me go talk to the dr. Then came back in  & proceeded to tell me they increased it but it was very little. Then shocked me, by telling me, my next step up was what's called a subutex. Which is a type of subboxen. These are normally prescribed to opiate addicts. Made it clear that was not only my next but LAST option.

Then I'm told because I'd been prescribed heavy pain medications in the past that my pain was not going to be able to be controlled. That my body was reaching for that same level of relief. Although I know she was saying HIGH. At this point I'm shocked & asked her was she sure? Yes, well I think but I can ask the Dr. was her reply. Are you sure, I said? After 5 yrs of not taking any opiates at all? I'd never heard this before.

I said, I don't understand why I can't be prescribed what worked in the past. Because they are stronger, she said. I had a surgeon after a surgery 10yrs ago tell me I had the highest tolerance for pain meds & the lowest he'd ever seen for pain. In my hospital stays I'm always given a step up from morphine because it doesn't work on me. I have to tell an anesthesiologist he will have a hard time knocking me out for surgery. Now that I've done my own research she is wrong. There are many factors & not necessarily because ""once upon a time"" I was prescribed strong opiates.

After being excited at the completion of my first visit & exiting with a great game plain. Then fast forward to my 2nd visit, leaving feeling labeled as nothing short of an addict or junkie. Even though I've stated in the past I never was addicted to the stronger narcotics. That's my experience & this is my honest review.

Before I close, I must mention that I've had friends, neighbors, strangers tell me how addicted they became to a subutex or a suboxone. I've watched a couple go through horrific withdrawals equivalent to methodone withdrawals. No thanks!|I am a Lupus patient with many other medical problems. The doctor here not only prescribed me meds but physical therapy which has helped me tremendously. I love her. She seem like she care about the patient. I like that at this office. It don't seem so commercial. You don't have to wear a mask but I do. They don't take long. You are in and out. A very good doctors office.|I've only been seeing Dr E in the Moody office a few months, so far I am pleased with her and her staff. Dr E is extremely easy to talk with. The trust between us has been a great change in my years of being passed around from one doctor to another since 1990. With lots of pain no one has given me 'options' until now. Anyone dealing with pain management knows what I mean. Some of my past pain docs were just arrogant and several have been suffering from a god complex we see in the medical community.
Dr E does have guidelines in using certain pain medications but having all my records she has given me options. If one thing doesn't work she's good to suggest others. So far I'm glad I found her. A big plus is her office is only 1 mile from the house. Never but 2 to 3 patients at the time so it's a short wait time which for me is huge.

And if we going off of Dr Maddox  ability to stop pain five stars isn't enough.  My wife  had  pain  that  was so bad she couldn't  function.  We saw Dr Maddox  he looked at test and asked her symptoms  and did a epidural and immediately  her pain stopped and it's been 4 days and no sign of it He gave her life back . Now the only reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is could have better communication  skills from the staff. We had a issue  ove the copay and even with calls.from.my insurance  it wasn't  resolved. But at the end of the day she's not hurting  . And that's  is all that matter..|Dr. Maddox has been my pain management Dr for several years now, he's stright forward and to the point.

I would have stayed with him but it was always a problem for me to get there. He is Awesome and I would recommend him to anyone.

Dr. Maddox is dedicated to helping his patients HEAL rather than simply medicating them.  He researches and explores new medical procedures that will improve his patient's quality of life.  I was one of the first to get the spinal cord implant and more recently,  the revision to the most current technology.  I cannot adequately express how happy this device has made me.  My quality of life has been dramatically improved and the need for medication has been reduced to occasionally rather than daily.  The staff is super supportive and caring.  This is not your average pain management facility.  They don't want to just manage your pain,  they do their best to eliminate it and restore you to your best self.|Dr Maddox is a terrific Doctor.

He really helped me.|I was seeing Dr. Maddox for 4 years. Sadly, I am no longer with him. He dumped me. He took good care of me. I miss him soooooo much!!! Oh take me back lol|Ok so I never had a PM doc before. I have PPO insurance so I'm thinking that I don't need any special docs. I went to the website it said book appointment  online. So I did. It said they will call be back for confirmation.  They didn't. So I call to make sure I had one. The old lady that answered the phone was rude to hell and back. I never wanted to cuss someone out so bad. I explained that the website said one thing and she's saying another. No need to be so freaking rude. I understand you have been sitting at that desk since moses but if you don't like your job retire. Also fix the website and be specific. You can not tell me that what I seen doesn't exist. Telling me know doesn't change the fact that it is there. Not to mention when you call it clearly says you can book appointments 24/7.

Very caring Dr and staff|I love coming here to Tuscaloosa Spine Care. The welcoming check-in staff are really nice and the nurses are just the absolute sweetest and Dr Spruill is so great! He really listened to me and my concerns. He explained everything to me that I needed to know about a possible upcoming procedure in a way that I could understand, not ""Dr talk"".
I truly recommend him to anyone!!!!|I had to use 3 other pain Drs because of my bone Dr. Finally just told them I am not using any other Drs for my pain other than Dr Spruill. He is the best. Always has listened and talks to you like you are somebody. The staff in the recovery area are the best also. I highly recommend them.|Our issue was NOT addressed and we did not feel that Dr. Spruill was the least bit compassionate towards the chronic pain my husband is experiencing.  We left with a medication that had contraindications for his other current health issues (discovered after reading the patient literature that came with it) -- and that was AFTER haggling with two separate nurses when they returned to check us out with NOTHING to provide any relief for my husband. The doctor said he WOULD prescribe something for pain while we waited for the tests.  However, the medication he intended cannot be taken with another medication my husband  is currently on.  If the doctor had stayed in the room long enough to actually discuss my husband's medical history or sufficiently review his current medications, that may have been avoided.  The fact is, as I was asking questions, he stood with most of his body outside the door and spoke to us with his head leaning past the door into the room.  He ordered some additional tests and when the results came in they called and told us basically what we had told THEM in-office on that visit.  And they wanted to refer him to a surgeon. We also told them at that visit that he had ALREADY seen a surgeon and we had been referred to have pain management UNTIL the surgery could be performed (there are some complications that must be dealt with prior). I told them that I wanted to be referred to another doctor because I didn't feel like Dr. Spruill paid any attention to my husband's concerns or history. I felt like we were just put into their ""test-running"" conveyor belt and I'll be happy if I never have to cross the threshold of that place again!   Meanwhile, after two days of me missing work, we are STILL dealing with debilitating chronic pain with NO end in sight for months!|They were not able to do the procedure I was scheduled to have. But it was because they were actually studying my records and scans. I really appreciate the fact they were more concerned with my health than and safety instead of checking the box for something to bill for.
They truly are concerned for your well being.
Thanks to Amanda and Dr. Spruill for taking good care of me.|I'm very pleased with the Spine Care Center.    I had my second epidural steroid injection today and pretty much everyone there is very friendly and really seem to care about the people they're treating.    I won't go into detail but one person wasn't very nice or professional for that matter at my first visit there and really made me feel awful but once I went back to a room everyone made up for what that lady did.|My wife has been going to Spruill for about 15 years with her back thanks to a car wreck when she was young. This is my first visit with a back issue. They are so nice at The Spine Care Center and they are very efficient and do good work. Highly recommend Dr. Spruill and his staff.|Dr. Spruill and his staff are AMAZING. They always are very accommodating.

I highly recommend Dr Cosgrove if you are suffering from back pain. My husband is his patient as well. Thanks to everyone and have a Merry Christmas!!|Not in a million years did I ever think Dr. Cosgrove would be the type to convict someone of a crime without even hearing from them.  But, that's exactly what he has done to me.  He listened to false statements against me and after 10 years as his patient has hung me out to dry without even so much as a chance to speak.  Merry Christmas to you too.  I can't believe someone would be this cruel right at Christmas (the celebration of our Lord's birth).  I have always held Dr. Cosgrove in high regards but no longer.  What he has done to me is not fair and even borders on cruel.  I asked him before my procedure to avoid this situation but instead he created it.  Just taking two minutes with me would have avoided this entire situation.  But, he was running over two hours behind (which I never once complained about) so he brushed me off and used me as a sacrifice.  Shame on you Dr. Cosgrove.  My loyalty has been with you for right at ten years and yet you threw me away like a piece of dirty laundry.  I thought your patients meant something to you but I guess I was wrong.  You hug my neck one minute and toss me aside the next.  A patient like me who follows the rules to the letter then you have others that cheat on your rules and that's the ones you keep.  Maybe you should not have so many patients so you truly can take the time to see a patient more than once a year.  I dearly love my PA and she's fabulous but that's not who I signed up to see.  I wonder, is that enough time for you to know your patients.  Obviously not!!!!|I arrived 23 minutes early for my procedure appointment.

He didn't listen, he told me what was wrong with me, where and how I was hurting instead of listening. When he left, they asked if I wanted my records to be transferred with him.....NOPE. So I lost all hope in finding decent treatment for my Degenerative Disc Disease, with has caused Carpal Tunnel in both arms and hands. And the pain is so very awful at times. Some more than not. But then I ended up being place under Dr. Graham's care. I can TRULY say how wonderful of doctor he is, along with the Nurse Practitioner I've dealt with. He is SO VERY attentive and caring. My first time meeting him, he hugged my, and does it every single time I see him :) He LISTENS to me and take my words, feelings and pain into consideration. Me also being a Type 2 diabetic, my health is something I take VERY SERIOUS. I still aim to live my life, work, take care of my home and family, and DR. GRAHAM helps so much with contributing to that. He won't change my meds if I'm alright with them, nor has he pushed any kind of surgery/s on me. He brings pleasant, kind and Spiritual uplifting vibes every time he walks into the room. And I am SO VERY GRATEFUL and THANKFUL to him for that. I just wish the receptionist at the front window was at least a little nice. Sad to say, but her demeanor and attitude is so unpleasant. Her communication towards me, every time I come in, is something I would rather not have to deal with. I just don't know if it's my race or she has a pick and choose to be nice to, attitude. Either way, it's VERY unprofessional and sad. I understand that people have bad days, but I try not to let my bad days define how I treat others.|I had tried to go to a similar healthcare facility and was never comfortable.  Dr. Graham and his staff have been great and I always felt cared for and listened to.|The first thing Dr. Graham did when entering the room before even speaking to me was hugged my neck. Before knowing me or even speaking to me he showed me he already cared. He hugged me and told me ""I'm so sorry you had to go through what you've been through."" I was so nervous to go because in the 5 years of seeing so many doctors not a single one understood what I was going through. I was so scared he would immediately want to try Injections and medicines I've tried a million times. Being 21 years old, I've had 6 knee surgeries on one leg and I have tried everything in the book. Dr. Graham took the time to hear my story and listen. He deserves more praise for how he treats his patients than I can express on this review. I would recommend him to anyone on this planet. Thank god for doctors like him. He's a god sent. He's a blessing to the physician community and if you're experiencing chronic pain like me, please go see Dr. Graham. He truly cares and listens.|I'm Sure Doctor Graham is a fine doctor, but the staff had a severe lack of cordiality and communication that prevented me from even being willing to see him. Three missed calls and a late appointment later, I arrive to see four behind the desk, none on the phone, all capable of answering. Sheets of redundant paperwork and several miscommunications later, the visit ended before it began. Hopefully others have better experiences than me, as doing a nerve block treatment here could never have felt comfortable.|I've been a patient of Dr. McCormick's for awhile now.  It's very frustrating because you can never reach a human being, it's always phone tag.  I have other health problems besides my back and I can't always make my appointment; however, I try to definately give over 24 hours notice if possible.  I showed up from my June appt only to be told that there was a $300+ balance on my acct from the surgical procedure I had in May that had to be paid before I could see the doctor.  They didn't bother to mail out a statement or tell me over the phone when I made the appt.  I  didn't have the money so we had to leave.  I canceled my July 24th appt on July 2nd because we still didn't have money to pay in full.  I had to cancel my August 25th appt because I woke up sick.  The rude receptionist returned my husband's call and said we needed to look at our calendar and pick a day when I wouldn't be sick and come in then.  I mean, who says something this stupid.  I called later and left a message for the office manager or Dr. Graham's wife to call me back and needless to say that was a week ago and I haven't heard a word.  It's pathetic that a smart mouth receptionist is apparently allowed to speak to patients anyway she chooses and gets away with it.  I wasn't happy with the care I was receiving anyway (two weeks of faxes from the pharmacy and calls from me trying to get a prescription refilled) and three nerve blocks and an Eblation that didn't work, etc., but I most definately won't stay somewhere that has staff like the receptionist.  She needs to remember that without patients, she wouldn't get a paycheck!  I would not recommend their office to anyone.|Dr Graham is the most kind and gentle man! He has an incredible bedside manner! He helped keep me as comfortable as possible until I had back surgery to fix the severe pain in my leg. I couldn't have made it without his help.

And everyone here is always willing to listen & tries very hard to put me at ease going thru this process.

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND them for any & all of your pain management (especially chronic pain) issues.|My experience with this Dr. was horrible. He literally said, ""I will not prescribe this medication because of your mental health."" He also then proceeded to tell me that he has more patients on less medication than me. I'm sorry but isn't it supposed to be a specialized treatment plan. Meaning one on one, not to put the patient in a group of totally different patients.

It's not my fault I have depression and anxiety problems Just like it's Not my fault I was in a wreck Years ago that Fused my spine together in Two places and that I am in Constant Pain. I wasn't driving. He doesn't want to give me Anything but one of the lowest pain medicine and he Wants me to take No anxiety depression medicine. He is The Worst! I have been to several pain Drs and All of them were better than him  I would Never refer Anyone to him. SPOS|**Horrible Experience at Premier Pain & Spine**

I was a patient at Premier Pain & Spine for over two years and initially had a positive experience. However, things drastically changed.

Dr. Stephen Jones, who was once attentive, became difficult to communicate with, especially when I encountered issues with billing and insurance. The staff, particularly at the front desk, displayed a shocking lack of knowledge about insurance processes, which resulted in significant confusion and an outstanding balance I was never informed about.

During a recent visit, I was told I couldn't be seen without my insurance cards, despite having two insurances on file. This miscommunication turned my appointment into a frustrating ordeal, and I felt treated poorly by staff who were unhelpful and dismissive. The situation escalated to the point where Dr. Jones discharged me without a valid reason, despite my compliance as a patient.

I also witnessed disturbing practices regarding patient management and records, including incorrect billing statements and unprofessional conduct by the staff. I felt discriminated against and treated with a lack of respect.

This experience has left me feeling drained and in search of new medical care. I urge anyone considering this practice to be cautious and look elsewhere if they don't want to be treated horribly. I was threatened by the Doctor & staff for no reasons. I've never been treated so badly in my entire life by medical ""unprofessionals"" at Premier Pain & Spine. I was also denied of my medical records but the office sent records with my social security number on them via email. So unacceptable! The doctor left me without medicine for days & days. This place gets no stars from me.|If I could give this Dr a negative review, I would. This couldn't be a more unprofessional Dr, his staff is the worst. He actually needs to have his medical license reviewed. He has already been reported for negligence to the board. Literally go anywhere else. He is awful.|Would like to know if it is possible to have refills on pain medication to extend past exact 28 day supply due to obvious lifestyle differences. There have been times when my medicine was not refilled until the day after I run out making it so my wife has to drive to Cherokee Co. to pick up the medicine on the exact day it was allowed to be refilled, then turn right around and drive to Fort Payne where I work so there is not a break in my medications. For those of us on pain management, but still trying live and provide for our family, this can be quite inconvenient. The two hour round trip every month is also a concern, seeing that this time eats into my personal off time with my employer. Surely regulations exist that would not be violated to accommodate for these varying lifestyles?

UPDATE: Was dismissed by Premier Pain and Spine after a telephone complaint regarding them completly changing my standard regimen of pain medication for over 20 years with my Neurologist, PC and since they took me on as a patient. They changed my medicines without consultation and without discussion and attempt to taper and simply called in the medication they ""wanted"", and not what I had been taking since choosing them as my Pain Management doctors. When I called to see what was going on, they returned my call  and said that Dr. Jones had made the choice to do (without consultation, approval, or tappering attempts) and that is how it would be. Naturally, I did not agree with this and knew that I was in for some terrible withdrawals. Within a couple of days I received a letter of dismissal in the mail. Dr. Jone's bedside manner and lack of communication with his patients, as well as his similar dealings as my own with other patients, will surely contribute to his business failing. If not, I will be greatly surprised!!!|I have been a patient of Dr.Jones for about 3 years and I truly love him as a doctor. He is very caring and listens to what you have to say. We always have a good laugh when I'm there no matter how bad I'm feeling. His staff is also very caring and enjoyable to be around. I would just like to say ""Thank You to each and everyone of them."" God Bless You All !|Finding Dr.Jones and his staff has been a God send. They take the time and listen to you so you can receive the best care possible. Dr. Jones also has conversations outside of why you are there. He has taken the time to check on my son and family's well-being. I highly recommend this office if you want people who care and empathize with you and your situation and that also understands nobody hurts the same and every treatment plan will be different.|Dr. Jones is an outstanding, compassionate, understanding physician.  His staff are all very understanding and work well with the public.  This office operates like a well oiled machine,  so you have to do your part keep your appoints , and be respectful.  You will get what you give with front-end staff.  Overall, I give this office a 5 star rating  they are outstanding in every aspect.|Super awesome group of people! I love Premier Pain and Spine! They all are so caring, compassionate, and respectful from the front desk to the nurses to Dr. Jones. You are not just a number. Dr. Jones will listen to you and he takes time to hear your complaints and works through every solution to make you feel better!
Thank you, Dr. Jones and staff! I love ya'll ! Yall are amazing  


I have to do an update. At the time I made this post everything above was true. Then I had to start seeing some nurse practitioner.  She was very rude every time I saw her. They always asked "" how is the medication working for you""? You could tell them til you're blue in the face and they still send in the same exact medication and dose. I have untraceable hemiplegia migraines along with other health issues.  The last appointment I had with this nurse practitioner was the final straw, I was finding another establishment when I left. But I had been up over 48 hours with my migraines and I was still in pain and I was exhausted. I had my head down in my hands while she was talking then she stopped and said "" Are you having an issue with staying awake""? I explained to her what was going on and she said ""Give me just a minute"" then left the room. She came back and said ""Here's your discharge papers, we will no longer see you""! I mean WTF!!??

-first appt waited hour and half before rescheduling (and they acted like I was being unreasonable when I requested to do so)
-no risks or side effects were ever discussed with me
-they treated me like a drug addict liar when I told them I didn't take medications
-bad reaction to shot, no response for days. When they did respond,  they said I must have a latex allergy lol
-my last call to them (to schedule 1 of the 4 shots my ortho begged of me), I could hardly breathe my thoracic was so bad.

They waited until after my 3rd block to tell me that I needed another referral for pain management other than blocks when I had been discussing pain management issues with them since my first block.  I got the 2nd referral and then they closed for a week for spring break, knowing the severe pain I was in.

I was told if the first block on my L-spine did not work, I would need an MRI.  The physical therapist that has been doing needling on me said I would need to try physical therapy if the needling did not last at least a week.  I left several messages asking for the MRI and PT orders as well as requested pain med to get me through but never received a call back.  I ended up having to get a referral to a different clinic and now have to wait for an opening while having to deal with this pain.

Dr. Landsen was also trying to diagnose me with something I do not even have during my last block.

When I first asked for something for pain until the blocks worked, Allison, Dr. Landsen 's nurse, told me they like to try alternative methods but not once did they offer any suggestions.

Allison also breached HIPPA that is a major violation.

My orthopedic and cardiologist physicians recommended that I try a pain center because my pain was greatly impacting my ability to function in daily life and physically improve my health.

The Center for Pain in Montgomery turned out to be life changing for me and enabled me to function like a regular human being again. The front office staff, nurses, and Dr. Ware were all very professional, kind, and showed empathy when dealing with my pain.
I had reached a point to where I literally felt like I was going to die. I have multiple chronic autoimmune illnesses including MS, severe Arthritis of the spine, and Conn's Syndrome. I was in a wheelchair full time until after my hip surgery four months ago. My pain was so excruciating that I could not put even the slightest pressure on my leg. I had to wait for a hip replacement for almost two years due to having had a serious heart attack.
I finally was able to have the replacement this past July as I was able to get my pain and also my blood pressure under control with the help of Dr. Ware.
Although that replacement was very successful, I am now waiting for a replacement of the other hip and again am in chronic pain.

Tubbs never read the MRI or medical records, left it up to an unqualified np.
You may get meds here, but that's as far as your care goes unless you want non FDA approved injections that give you joint damage and cause bone loss.|I would give zero stars but google does not allow that. This office is fraudulent beyond comprehension. The doctor only cares about how much he can milk your insurance and how crowded they can keep the waiting room. While sitting in the rooms I've heard talk outside of the rooms about providers having contests to see who can order the most tests and injections and procedures regardless if it's actually medically necessary or not with monetary incentives for whoever won the contest. Not to mention their ""manager"", if that's what she can even be called, with her careless attitude towards absolutely anything, not to mention their nurse who is constantly on some kind of power trip, I think I recall her name being milly. Coming here was an absolute embarrassment and I will be reporting to the board of medical examiners.|I have been going to Dr. Tubbs for years. He cares for his patients. He is the only doctor that has been able to figure out where my pain is coming from. He works with his patients to find the best medication. Every time I have gone to his Cullman office to have procedures done,  I've been 1 of the first 5 individuals to have their procedures done and all of us join in with the prayer that he says with his nurses before he starts working on his patients to relieve the pain that we want relief from. I highly recommend becoming one of his patients.|I was very nervous my first visit, but as soon as I met Dr. Tubbs, he put me completely at ease! His staff is very friendly as well! Dr. Tubbs will do everything he possibly can in order to help alleviate your pain! I have a spinal stimulator now and would recommend anyone with chronic pain to try the trial stimulator to see if it helps ease some or all of your pain! I would truly recommend Dr. Tubbs and his staff to anyone with chronic pain!!|My mother has been going there for 5 months. From the beginning he tried to put her on higher and stronger pain medicine than what she was on originally. It has taken these 5 months to get him to prescribe her what she was on originally before he changed! Never been anywhere that tries to push more medication on the patient when the patient is trying to steadily take less medication! At the 4-month point he (Dr.Tubbs) comes into the room as he has the past couple of months and says what can I do if y'all this month as he's looking to me for information since I am my mother's caretracker and have been discussing her well-being and course of action from the beginning. Long story short.....All lies and deceptions!hard to trust a doctor that's going to be taking care of your mother's well-being when he can look you in the eye and lie to me!!|He had me at ...

They have worked with me to find the most effective approach to managing my pain through different treatment methods. Over time we have found a regimen that is very effective for me. Throughout the process Dr. Herrick and staff have been willing to consider different procedures always taking the time to explain, answer questions, and together continue moving forward to find an effective methodology for my particular circumstances.

When I had my first visit I was using a cane while walking and not coping well with the situation. Over time as we explored different approaches I have been able to walk without needing to use a cane for most activities.

I cannot say enough about how well I have benefited from the care and treatment I have received from Dr. Herrick, the nurse practitioners, and others on the staff I have had the good fortune to interact with through the years.|I have been a patient for the last 14 years as a 100% disabled combat veteran. Undeniably, the best pain management center in the Southeast United States.  I have multiple chronic pain issues that require medication, various types of procedures, and monthly follow-ups.

Highly recommend DR Katz and his staff.|I've been a patient of Dr Herrick & The Center For Pain since 2004, at least four visits each year.

I am very blessed to be a patient here.|The Nurse Practitioner was super nice and helpful. He was honest and professional. I appreciate his help.  Since my earliest trips to Dr. Katz, I have always been treated with compassion and respect. Thank you!|Dr Shinkle does great with the spinal injections and rarely doesn't hit the exact spot needed.
However, you will never meet with Dr Shinkle to access your pain or treatments. You will meet with different nurse practitioners, never the same from month to month, who will take your medical information and results and return with a medication plan based purely on a step by step from the minimum dosage and medication no matter your condition or pain levels.
Center for Pain does not diagnose any conditions, suggest any other treatments or access any causes other than what you were referred by your physician. They treat only chronic pain conditions and any other pain should be treated by your physician or an ER.
A nurse practitioner at Center for Pain told me that doctors ""dump"" their patients on Center for Pain to avoid dealing with the DEA/Medical Boards since the opioid crisis became political.
See your personal physician, orthopedic doctor, etc. and have them refer you to Center for Pain with EXACT details on what prescriptions or pain treatments they recommend and Center for Pain will execute those recommended treatments very well . Otherwise you will spend months and months and tons of money before you ever receive adequate relief.
The shortcomings aren't Center for Pains fault, and not Dr. Shinkle's either; it's the result of the regulations placed on them by federal and state agencies due to the Opioid Crisis.",2024-11-16|2025-02-20|2025-01-02|2024-12-11|2024-10-02|2025-02-18|2024-05-08|2025-02-21,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|3,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",82.4|81.8|72.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|efficient_service|thorough_care,https://www.linkedin.com/company/center-for-pain-of-montgomery,https://twitter.com/center4pain,https://www.facebook.com/Center4Pain,https://www.instagram.com/thecenterforpain,,,,,"3342887808, 3342888089, 8555277246, 8338101165",ChIJucKbPgYsjIgRQocaf5SnVA8,427

I am pleased with the medical care I'm receiving at this facility. I also feel comfortable, welcomed, and treated as an individual by the practitioners, all of the techs, and both the front-end and back-end staff. It can be a busy practice at times, but if there is something you need to discuss with your practitioner all you have to do is explain the issue or tell them what it is you need. We have to remember that this is a pain center. Pain is not seen it is measured and it can only be measured based on diagnostic tests and the information we provide to the physician. A little bit of patience can go a long way to having a great understanding between you and the pain management practitioners. I've had great success with this group and I recommend them highly. I say give them a try if you need pain control but only if you are willing to invest in wanting to get better and be truly honest about your pain levels. The therapy is only as good as the information provided. Great group of people, friendly, but professional at the same time.  They take to get to know the patients and try greeting them when they arrive at the facility if they aren't busy. Friendly atmosphere and the facility is an open area with with very few doors until you reach the exam or procedure rooms. This makes the atmosphere feel inviting and relaxing.

The Centers for Pain located at the Chestnut Street office has a totally different atmosphere than the one on St. Luke Drive. The main difference between the two offices is the speed at which you are seen and your wait time to be seen. Both facilities are great but I just prefer the Chestnut Street office since I started going there. I love the staff at the Centers for Pain. Dr. Almeida and his Nurse Practitioners have improved my quality of life over the two years I have been seeing them. They helped to control my pain by managing my medicine and ensuring I wasn't feeling, too, much pain while trying to reach my management goal. They even found and repaired a fracture in my lower back and sacrum area which was able to be done as an outpatient procedure in the office. I WAS ECSTATIC and overjoyed by this fact. They took such good care of me. I felt well cared for and safe throughout the entire procedure and after it was completed. I am doing well    now and so happy they found this problem because it has decreased a great deal of my pain nowadays and made it somewhat easier for me to sleep. I'm grateful for this. I could sing their praises all day, but to wrap it up in a nutshell, they're a wonderful group, I wholeheartedly recommend trying them if you have a chronic pain problem that affects your daily life, if you are looking for a pain doctor who's willing to listen to you, explain to you what's has gone wrong with your body, and why it's gotten to this point now. Basically, listen to the hard truth and then choose to seek the proper treatment program to improve your pain levels, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CENTERS FOR PAIN. I hope my post has been inspiring to someone who has been seeking a good Dr and a great staff that works with him. Thanks to The Centers for Pain for making my life manageable.|I've had great experiences while coming from the staff members of the  Center for Pain.

I used to really feel like they cared but here recently in the last two years really the last three months through the six months I'll say the care has gotten really  Impersonal When I started using this practice, it was not nowhere near the size. It is today and I can feel more like a number that just gets run through and the voice. And what I'm saying is not truly heard The provider I saw today I had requested about nine months ago to never see again but yet they also sent her in again. I have become very satisfied with this practice. When I first started going I would've gave them five stars. I have been seeing them probably the better part 12 to 14 years I don't remember exactly over the years is just gotten to wear. You only see a nurse practitioner unless you request to see the doctor now Mr. Aaron shingles is a great doctor. I enjoy him very much but he is not available if anyone has questions  about this feel free to contact me|The doctors and staff were very courteous and showed real concern for my medical issues. They talked over a plan with me and perfected it to accommodate my preferences and concerns. Very good atmosphere. All of the staff were very personable, not only to me, but everyone in the office while I was there.|My visit was very good.  My nurse practitioner knew my issues, made sure nothing had changed, gave me the time to question if I needed to.  She was considerate of my time.  Even the lab tech was upbeat and friendly.  Something you don't encounter any more|I am a patient of Dr. Shinkle and have been seeing him for years. He is smart and caring . He literally saved my life and he always pays attention .
The entire staff should receive a ""5"" star review. I have only had an issue with one staff member which was dealt with immediately.   Hats off to the Prattville staff and a big ""thank you""|Great place, great staff. The procedure appoint time line from in the door to out is amazing... But the follow up appointment tend to take a little longer, thorough, but longer...|My over all opinion is still pending being I'm very recently new & currently under the care of The Center For Pain have had 1 appointment that was rather unorthodox & seemed very rushed to me & I felt the doctors disintrest Tho who knows for sure about that to? I'd guess I expected a care management plan & tho I am seeking pro actively non addicting prescription in care & what Ive been prescribed helps it's less then a bandaid for me, I hope to get a care plan for my life long betterment then this current I'll update further as things progress being the aforementioned is my point blank first impressions.
Update: Again all still rather unorthodox to me however it seemed to be somewhat a well oiled ""machine"" of a sense in the order of how they do things aside of the lack if communication between The center for pain & CVS pharmacy whom stated they couldn't get through over the phone with The center if pain that if which I'd informed this info. I've had 1 procedure so far as I'd Saud they've a efficient process that seems routine to the staff Tho my last memory was of a young fellow ripping my pants down for injections My next appointment is the 26th if February. The first procedure has enabled me a tad more mobility then I'd had tho I'm yet to feel confident in my ability to confidently stand or walk both are still uncertain and at times rather scary I hang on hope the next procedure will help far greater then the last. I WILL UPDATE.|My experience today was awful. The nurse I was briefly seen by was unprofessional and rude. She walked out of my doctor visit and slammed the door without assisting me. All because I was asking questions about my chart and the pain medication that she was telling me she want to prescribe. I felt afraid because she went out into the office yelling to the other staff for me to leave. She went as far as accusing me of saying I would beat her. Then I questioned her about what she had said she tried to say that it sounded like I had stated that while she was slamming the examing room door. I have not been treated so horribly by medical staff until today at Center for Pain in Prattville. We are all human beings and remember nurse lady you to have family and one day they may meet someone rude and unprofessional as yourself and get mistreated like you did me.|The staff have always made me feel comfortable.

They have made my life bearable with my condition and are always so supportive and helpful! I have been going there for over a year now and I am able to do my work now because of him. Before I was not able to do much of anything but they have really made a difference in my quality of life!|I would think twice before going to this office. Dr.Meyers is extremely rude and will stand in the doorframe and just stare at you , he might ask how you're doing and then leave.
This happened at both times that I actually got to see him. He also told me at the very first appointment that he doesn't believe Fibromyalgia exists and it's just an excuse to get pain medicine. I was so shocked that I was speechless.
I must say the stars of this office are the staff! Brenda,Miranda, and the ladies in the back! If I could just see them I would've stayed but not with him!|I was referred for pain management for my back, He ordered extensive x rays, and asked for mri, but never looked at them. I felt rushed through my appointment. I didn't feel that the Dr or his assistant listened or cared.|He sent me for X-rays and MRI to get down to find my pain area on why I was hurting . He found it in my neck I also had a nerve testing done  . I've had two epidurals already that helps . My neuropathy still gives me problems but not like it should he's changed my meds around . His and and himself are just great very nice people . He has awesome bedside manners and listens to you .This is being edited as he kicked me out of his clinic because my Psychiatrist put me on Valium. He told me they've done all they can do..|I would leave zero stars if I could. My mother came into the office ( the pain clinic) and saw Dr. Joshua Meyer! His bedside manner is disgusting. Enters the room & never spoke from beginning to end; not even when she was leaving . That is disgusting behavior for any human being let alone a ""Dr"". Zero stars I do not & I never will recommend him as a Dr. It cost $0 to be polite. What an ugly spirit!|I have been a patient here for me to years. I almost cannot believe the changes in the atmosphere in this place since Dr. Meyer has taken over. There was a time when I absolutely hated to come to this place because of what went on in the waiting room and sometimes with the doctor. But now, it is a much more pleasant experience and I truly appreciate Dr. Meyer for what he does.I also appreciate the staff which seems to be is dedicated to taking care of the individual is Dr. Mayer is. I now would rate my visit and eight or nine out of 10 compared to what I would have rated it a three or four out of 10.Thank you Dr. Meyer and staff for what you have done in this office! May God bless you all!|I saw Dr. Meyer for the first time December 6th. He changed my meds and ordered x-rays.  I was very impressed with both him and his staff. He has already helped me and I look forward to a long relationship with him. I definitely recommend him if you're willing to do what he asks you to do.  Thank you Dr. Meyer and I'll see you next month!|I would be very hesitant before going to this clinic. I last saw the doctor on 12/8/22 and Maranda, at the front desk, scheduled me for 1/6/23, and this was a day they were not even open. I came to the clinic, and they were closed. I get to the office and no one was there. I'm not sure how this happened, but from the phone call on the following Monday I could tell this was a mistake. I don't believe I ever heard an apology at all. I work a full time job, and I must schedule appointments well in advance. I can't just take off when I like, and I don't have a lot of sick or vacation time. I come 1/10/23 and was told to sit in the lobby to be seen. This was not the conversation we had on Monday. I told you I had to be at work by 8:00 am and told you why I couldn't take off any longer. This is your fault and not mine. This is your error and not mine. At this point, I will have to go without medicine. I have every right to be angry! This is now two wasted trips and gas! I'm being punished for something I didn't do wrong, and this was not my fault. I'm now being told to find another doctor. They really show care for their patients. Maranda has shown incompetence. If this had been me, I wouldn't have a job. If I had not called, I would still be waiting for a return phone call. I've never had this experience with any doctor or his office. Once I stop taking the medicine and start to take it again, it will make me extremely sick, but I have no choice at the moment.",2024-12-24|2025-01-03|2025-01-28|2023-01-11|2024-06-19|2021-11-16|2022-12-09|2023-05-25,5|1|2|2|1|4|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do he take Medicaid","Yes.

She  gave me care even when I didn't have insurance.

She is a  ""Pain Management"" doctor. She doesn't just dish out pain meds so if that's what you are looking for them you better keep looking.

She did help me, I was totally happy with her. She diagnosed me with chronic pain syndrome, degenerative disc disease, migraines and several other conditions. However after 13 years,  January 2020.she divorced me as a patient. She did not give me an explanation as a matter of fact, I was basically kicked out of her office by her staff and was later sent a letter in the mail.

Not only was that very disappointing. Not to mention being unprovoked and unprofessional. I followed her directions very carefully. I never failed a drug test. I Have no idea why after 13 years she  could do that as a doctor. Fortunately, in March 2020 I found an amazing new Pain Specialist. He has alternative therapy and treatments including Radio frequency injections. I am now not just existing, I am thriving. So I suppose I should thank her. For almost 5 years I am being treated by
Dr Brian Thoma at Cahaba Pain and Spine Care
2010 Patton Chapel Rd # 200, Hoover, AL 35216|Dr. Janush has treated me for an extremely painful chronic injury for more than 14 years. In all probability, she saved my life. Her efforts to find relief for me were never exhausted.  While I have at times had to wait an hour or more to see her that is an exception, and is explained by the length of time she takes with her patients. My first visit with her was two hours long. She has been very thorough and compassionate, she listens to my questions and offers understandable responses. She suggested a neurostimulator for me which helped tremendously. She is, in my long experience with her and in my opinion, an excellent doctor. However, I have found her office staff unreliable. I have frequently left messages and questions which never received a response. Dr. J is sometimes slow to complete needed reports or documents for my disability ins carrier, but I suspect her staff may be responsible. She has also charged an exorbitant fee to draft a letter for me, and it was explained to me that it was because she expedited the letter, though she had the request for the letter for a month. I have never had a negative experience with DrJ herself but have many times been very frustrated with her staff. I think she's an excellent doctor and an outstanding lady. She's very personable, approachable, understanding and compassionate, with an exuberant, vivacious personality. I rate four stars only because of the admin frustrations.|Dr. Janush is amazing and her staff is just as wonderful! I've been battling constant muscle contractions in my neck and shoulder for years. Oral medications only provide a few hours of relief, but Dr. Janush was able to provide a longer lasting relief to my condition with injections. She's not just a great doctor though, she is a beautiful person that truly loves her patients. She doesn't just breeze in and out of the room. She takes time to listen, answer any questions, and she provides a whole concept approach to advising patients of at home care.|Dr. Janush has been a great doctor for me since 1997. She is very professional, knowledgeable, stays up-to-date on all forms of medical treatment, medications and forms of rehabilitation.
I would not be in physical condition which keeps me functioning for a soon to be 68 yr old female.

I have referred her to family members & friends.
All she asks is that you listen to her advice and follow her instructions.
She is the best in her field. She has gotten my family members and myself back to physical abilities we lost due to injuries.
Thank you Dr.Rochell Janush, You have a heart of gold and love for your patients.
Thank you and God bless you and your family|Dr. Janush is a very caring, compassionate and incredibly intelligent doctor. Being a combat veteran and former MMA fighter that suffers from various physical ailments she is the only one who has taken a serious interest in helping treat my pain over the years. She goes above and beyond what most other doctors do. She takes the time to listen, test and diagnose. She lets you know from the initial contact that it could be an ongoing progress to get the combination of treatments perfect and for me she has. I have been a patient of hers for 5 years and I don't find the wait longer than any other doctor. If anything it is a shorter wait. Her staff is courteous and most of them have been there many years. They get to know each patient individually and go out of their way to help whether it be the receptionist at the front desk or the office manager. Personally, I find the accusations in the negative reviews to be untrue in my 5 year experience. Dr. Janush always comes in with a smile, even when it's obvious, after getting to know her, that she hasn't had the best of days. It never stops her from giving her patients ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of her time and attention. For the accusation that she gives blocks with no anesthetic is an outright fabrication. In 5 years that has never once happened to me. For anyone that might think that this is an inside review my name is James Carswell. If you are in pain and want a doctor that actually cares about her patients then she is the one to see.|There should be a Zero star rating for this vile whack job. Anyone who is happy with this Doctor just hasn't been there long enough. She refuses to go one inch out of her way to deal with insurance companies- even when there is an issue that results in great harm to the patient. She said she wasn't paid to do that, but charges exorbitant fees. I had a change in insurance that required her to change my medication. She botched the conversion chart (which a 2nd grader could figure) and then refused to correct it. I immediately got sick. She refused assistance in any way- even though I was a long time patient, and had paid many thousands of dollars. To run the bill up, you must take excruciating injections that do absolutely nothing. She botched many of these, once sending my husband to the hospital in an ambulance when she punctured his lung. This woman cares about nothing but money- is rude , vulgar, profane and has a God complex. She enjoys bullying patients who are at her mercy because they need medicine. You'd be better off going to a pusher--and a pusher would care more about what happens to you than this quack. Save yourself an ordeal and find a decent doctor-- which excludes this one.|Wow! She really takes the time to make sure you understand what she is going to do or what she wants to do before anything is done.  Dr. Janush made me feel that I was ok for hurting and was able to pinpoint some root causes whereas other doctors would just put a ""band-aid"" with medication or physical therapy. She brings a fresher perspective as to my ailments and what can be done for it. Very nice and understanding-worth the wait!|Over the past seven years I have been dealing with a chronic pain and fatigue disorder called fibromyalgia.  When I first started going to see her I felt like she was an answer to my prayers, because no other doctors had any idea was going on with my body.

I have now been a patient of Dr. Janush for the past five years. During most of this time she has been very helpful to me, and I have felt like my health was getting better.

However, during the past month, she had to switch one of medications as the company no longer made the one that had been working great for me for the past five years. I have broken out in hives all over my body unlike anything that I have ever experienced. I have even had to take a leave of absence from work in order to deal with my illness.

I have also been to my primary care physician sick times in the last six weeks, and I have had to take three rounds of predinosone without much results. My primary doctor sent me to a wonderful allergist, Dr. Lee. Come to find out I am allergic to the new medicine. However due to the nature of the medication, I can't just stop taking it without getting very sick. I have literally pleaded  in tears for her to see me or to write a prescription for a medicine to which I am not allergic. To my dismay, all she has told me to do is quit the medication and deal with the withdrawal or go to the emergency room. During this most difficult time, I have felt completely alone to find a solution that doesn't require going through withdrawal or sitting in the emergency room for hours. I have been to the emergency room twice before and all they gave me was vicadin or Ativan to knock me out, charge me $100.00, and send me home. Unless one is literally dying, the emergency room isn't very helpful.

During the past month, I have felt like Dr.Janush does not care about me at all. The medication she prescribed is causing me to break out in hives, and she refused to take time to see me or to write me a different prescription.  No other doctor has ever treated me this way, especially when I am having problems with the new medicine she prescribed.

For this reason I have decided that I need to take my business elsewhere.",2019-02-06|2022-09-07|2018-06-05|2020-11-03|2016-05-05|2017-10-06|2017-05-15|2017-10-01,1|4|5|5|5|1|5|3,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Do you work with patients with myasthenia gravis to develop exercise program?","Please contact the clinic directly.",long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpm-holdings-inc,https://twitter.com/cpmamericas,,https://www.instagram.com/one_cpm,,,,,3.34261E+15,ChIJM7hv1QcsjIgR0E6sbpM_oHo,29

Now how is that. Changing over a new leaf trying to be honest, I get penalize. They boot me off the program and tell That I have an addiction problem.

In the best part of this is I have surgery in 3 weeks. I have no pain doctor. I'm glad I have jesus.....|Pain clinic's are a waste of time and money was able to take care of my pain through my regular doctor who new my condition. Government steps in and makes me spend more money for another doctor that wants to give you the weakest pain medicine or some new stuff that your insurance doesn't cover|This place is a complete waste of time. Neurology sent me here. The staff is courteous, but they just pass you off to someone else. If you are allergic to anabolic steroids and they don't work for you, there is nothing else they will do because they only perform steroid injection 'nerve blocks' there. I got referred to do biofeedback, and was told to go see my gynecologist. (Which I've already been and they told me to see neurology lol) They're playing hot potato with me. : / No one wants to actually put the work into figuring out the underlying cause, or investigate a solution. Way to go UAB.|So I have been in severe pain for several months waiting on Financial approval. I had to pay to see another doctor just to get a referral to here. I spent more time in the waiting room than I spent with a doctor. I saw I guess a nurse or resident where the most physical thing they did to determine my pain was to run their fingertip down my spine barely touching me and asked did that hurt....well no? Then when the actual doctor comes in no kidding he was there less than 20 seconds. I was a new patient and I left with nothing to help with my pain. I even asked if they could do an injection and his response was no u need an MRI before we can do anything for you. Ok well if you knew this why wouldn't you have had me do this before hand while I was waiting the last two weeks for this appointment? I don't understand where doctors caring bedside manner have gone but you definitely won't find it here!|WHY IS TURNLEY WORKING IN PAIN MEDICINE? When I filled out my 15 page medical history and finally got an appt. I overheard a nurse say this right before my appt. with Dr. Turnley, ""Dr. Turnley says she is NOT starting even one more patient on opioids!"" I should have walked out then but -- like lots of people -- I was desperate for pain relief. Turnley's comment indicates 2 things: (1.) a complete lack of empathy and (2.) self-serving priorities, IOW she's more concerned with her own personal comfort than with the health of her patients. I've tried at least 15 types of pain treatment, including all 3 approved ""fibromyalgia medications,"" which did not work, possibly because I also have spinal stenosis and disc disease. When Turnley found out I had tried those meds SHE LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO WITH ME! So, after filling out page after page of documentation and waiting for weeks TWICE, I left demoralized and still in pain. Why? Because Dr. Turnley didn't want patients who needed pain medication because they might require extra time, thus interfering more in her life than patients who aren't suffering from chronic pain. Why didn't she choose pediatric medicine? Or mortuary science?|I've seen all the negative reviews. I myself have had nothing but good experiences.

I'm sorry but if you have a broke arm or leg you get it set because it is considered an emergency. When I called and spoke to a nurse she was rude and said everybody was in the same boat there. Whatever that means. As luck would have it I got in touch with her Orthopedic Dr and he got someone that could do it in three days. It was done today. I can tell you that after hearing from several Drs that she should not have had to wait to get this procedure done.

Kudos to all the staff that were involved in treating me.

Dr. Kasper came and talked me through the procedure and ensured all my questions were answered. He was very friendly and professional.

I believe it was Jolie that put in the IV. She did a fantastic job! I barely felt it and she got it on the first try (I have some IV horror stories, so this was a very pleasant change!)

Given my history of multiple back surgeries, permanent nerve damage, and severe arthritis throughout my spine and joints, I was eager to find a solution.
Unfortunately, I am not a suitable candidate for epidural procedures due to a severe allergic reaction to steroid injections, which was documented by an allergist in Dothan over 15 years ago. This reaction was so severe that it took me over six months to recover, and I was advised to avoid and never take steroids again with the first injection being so severe another could kill me. .
Regrettably, my experience with this clinic has been disappointing, as they seem to prioritize profit over patient well-being. I was required to purchase a back brace and underwent two nerve ablation procedures, as well as drug testing n every visit. The first ablation provided some relief, but the second procedure was unsuccessful, and I was left in more pain. Despite my repeated assertions that I could not undergo epidural injections due to my allergy, the staff, particularly Regis, continued to push for these procedures & Regis was down right ugly to me on multiple visits. My primary care physician even provided documentation of my allergy, but this was not sufficient to deter Regis from insisting epidural injections.
Furthermore, the clinic's practice of drug testing on every visit (every 3 weeks)  resulted in additional expenses, as my insurance did not cover these tests. In light of my experience, I would strongly advise current and prospective patients to exercise caution when considering treatment from Dynamic Pain and Wellness. I wld advise you to RUN NOT WALK ....RUN FROM THIS PLACE! They treat you like a number; bottom line you are a dollar $$ sign to them.|Only the patient is allowed to go back. It doesn't matter if they are hard or hearing or have memory problems. They most of the time don't return phone calls. If you decide you don't want a procedure the suggest you should have they may tell you they can't do anything else for you. They were really good at first but the longer my boyfriend went to see them the worse they got...well when they got the new doctor that you only see during procedures. Don't recommend thet at all now.|See below recommendation for btr practice in adjacent bldg 2nd floor. Went to this office about a year ago and was going to get some injections done. I put a review up here back then about how it was tho do no c it. It was quite an unpleasant visit.  The doctor was nice enough, but the staff is quite lacking. As life happens. I actually had forgotten this experience. So when my pain worsened, I contacted them again and set an appointment and went to see them.  it was only after this visit that I was reminded of my feelings for this practice. For the most part, the staff make you feel unwelcome, rushed and are quite insolent in their demeanor. towards u, Like the patient is burdening them. I did not see the doctor this time, so this is no reflection on him, unless he's okay with the way his staff is.  sorry to have to write such a review, but truth is truth. my recommendations is to see Dr.  in the adjacent building 2nd floor. Perhaps doctor jerkin and this dr can team up, but leave this  staff behind. The staff at 2nd floor dr office is what 1 would expect from a doctor visit, which is filled with pleasantness and respect and an obvious willingness and desire to help you or be of assistance.|I am very happy with this clinic. I get my injections and medication. I wish I got to take to Dr. Sam more. Other than that they take good care of you.|Everyone who works here is absolutely wonderful except for NP Regis Johnson who brings the entire place down.
I've been living with chronic pain and illness for 25 years and I have NEVER had issues with a provider. The first time I saw Regis she tried to sell me on a spinal cord stimulator. If she had gone over my history, she would know that it wouldn't work for me. The second time she misdiagnosed me with an SI joint injury and scheduled a procedure. The MRI came back that my SI joint was fine so I had an unnecessary procedure.
At my appointment on 10/9, I specifically asked NOT to see her but was told there was nothing they could do.
My appointment with her was the epitome of medical gaslighting. I have never witnessed a NP with such a God complex! She will argue with you and cut you off when you ask questions. I told her twice that we weren't communicating effectively and asked to see the Doctor or a different NP. This infuriated her and I was told no the first time. The second time she said she would talk to him, left the room and came back to say the doctor said the same thing.
The appointment ended in an argument with her threatening me in the hallway that ""I didn't want to see her raise her voice and that I didn't want to go there."" She then said ""Your not getting ANY meds"" (3 non-opioids) until I come back in 2 weeks for ANOTHER procedure and the 2 weeks after that at a follow up appointment..
The clinical director Jessica admitted to me on the phone yesterday that she witnessed how angry Regis was and how upset I was but could really care less about the situation.
Great way to treat a patient! She has NO business working in the medical field and treating patients with multiple chronic pain and illness conditions. All she wants to do is sign you up for a procedure like a sleazy salesperson.
A detailed three page letter has been sent to Dynamic Pain and Wellness as well as the Alabama Nursing Board. I don't expect a response as they could care less if they lose a patient even the one who was Dr. Searcy's very first patient.
Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.|Have had nothing but good treatment.  Doctor is quick, no messing about and boom done.  Has saved me from major surgery.  Taking very good care of knee pain and backpain.  If you don't want surgery come talk to them.  They will work on your pain.  Also, i do not take pain meds, I have not needed to.  I'm 54 years old and so far happy that I came here.  Doesnt hurt to come talk to them.|Everything has gone well since I started going to Dynamic Pain & Wellness.  The only thing I would like to see is Dr Searcy coming in to meet his patients instead of coming in, doing the procedure and leaving.  We need to know the doctor who's working on our bodies!  Everytime I went there for a procedure, his team got me ready with my face down on the table, Dr Searcy came in to do the procedure and left right out before I even got off the table.   He's just not very personable!|Don't waste your time with this place.  They want to inject you under the guise of being ""interventional"" but they don't listen to where your actual pain is.  Regis is the WORST medical ""professional "" I have ever had the misfortune to run across. Don't dare ask her a question and don't dare ask to see a doctor because it won't happen.

I've given them the correct information. Many times and I have had it confirmed, That they have the correct information. But yet they still can't get it together, No return calls, Even with something as simple as getting a prescription for a tens unit. They can't get it into my insurance company. The receptionist and the medical staff at the birmingham office are rude. I have waited up to 3 hours in their office for an appointment. Find another pain clinic. Any other pain clinic.

Alabama Anesthesiology and Pain Consultants is an excellent clinic to address chronic pain issues.|They used to be okay, but lately it's a struggle to even get through by phone; they can't keep a doctor to save their life and the last person we saw didn't seem very focused on us.

We haven't always agreed on everything, but pain management must be the hardest ailment to treat. As far as I'm concerned they are Heaven sent. I feel that most disagreements that I've read in these reviews comes about because pain management has very strict rules and regulations by DEA that they and the pharmacist have to follow. When it comes to narcotics the DEA rules supreme and yet the Pain Consultants do all they can to help and assistance. In the two years I've gone through three minor procedures and two major spine operations. I have virtually every vertebrae between LL5 and Thoracic 9 connected with straps, rods, bridges and screws. The major surgeries were caused by my walker with wheels that flip out from under me and I landed on the tip of my tailbone back in March 2024 on the concrete driveway which basically wrecked my lower lumbar causing the two major surgeries that I've undergone recently. Yet, I now feel that I am really on my way to some major relief from all the pain. For that I have nothing but appreciation for my neurosurgeon and the AA&PC doctors and practitioners.

I received treatment with Pain and Rehabilitation for several months, ending in September of 2022. Flash forward to August 2023, where I receive notification that Pain and Rehabilitation has turned over my account to a collections agency. This is despite the following:
- As active duty military, my visits are 100% covered by Tricare insurance.
- The only charge I ever incurred out of pocket was a fee for a missed appointment that I paid and have the charge statement to prove
- At no point in time from September 2022 to August 2023 did Pain and Rehabilitation attempt to contact be by phone or mail. Not a single time.
While this may seem to be a simply mistake, an inability to maintain proper accounting or turning over an account for collection in error is, at best negligent, and at worst criminal. Such poor record keeping can inflict damage on an unsuspecting person's credit and cause completely unneeded stress.
Be very aware of seeking treatment with Pain and Rehabilitation and I highly encourage you to maintain excellent financial records.|Fantastic experience!

I have been seeing her for around 3 years, and have always been treated with kindness and dignity.  I have never been treated like someone who is simply seeking medication, as some doctors treat patients.  I have been diagnosed and evaluated for my particular condition, and treated appropriately. The only negative thing I have to say about seeing Dr. Connor is the wait time.  I have never been to an appointment that didn't last at least 2.5 - 3 hours.  She is an excellent doctor with a lot of patients, so the office visits take a while.|Today was my first appointment and they follow social distancing and everyone had face masks. So i felt comfortable being there, and the staff was so kind. Dr Connor was just a gem, what an absolutely sweet lady. You can tell she really cares about her patients. I give them a 5 star rating, and would refer them to anyone!|I have only had 2 visits with Dr Conner, my first impressions of her are great!
I love my primary care physician but have such a limited time with him, it is like you only can tell them so much in the appointment allotted time. Walk ins get even less, I might be having multiple symptoms but can't tell them about all, just pick the one that they can treat now.
I went to see Dr Conner on a scheduled visit, but she noticed somethings unrelated to my visit. It was enough that she had me in the ER for testing within a hour.
She cares about her patients, and in her position, some people would take advantage.
I would find it hard not to be critical. She trust her patients and I feel they trust her, I do.
Everyone knows that feeling when you go to ER or a Dr with a unseen injury or with pain, you feel like a drug seeker until you can prove that you are not. She shows empathy, concern, Knowledge, and common sense.
If there is a down side of her practice, I have yet to see it. I really hope now, that someone listens and believes me, that they may find out what is wrong. Tired of trying so hard to live and suffering they whole time. I want to be me again.|I have been going to Dr. Connor for 10 years. She's been there as a physician and friend. She always there when you need her to be. Angela and all of the staff are precious people. If your not happy there then you need to evaluate the real reason your there asking for medication. I trust her to also care for my mother and other family members. You want the best doctor in Alabama for your pain care then go see Dr. Conner.|I have been going to Dr. Conner for 9 or 10 years and have been very involved in the decisions  regarding my care and the medication I take!  I am fearful of some pain meds. And she has always listened to me and discussed my concerns!
I feel she always has my best interest at heart and works to help me get to a therapeutic level so I can function to take care of myself and be the most productive person I can be!
I will always want her for my doctor and I trust her with my life.|Dr Connor is one of the FEW, one of the GREAT,  ONE IN A MILLION.  Before i met Dr Conner,  I felt hopeless,  believing the best portion of my life was over.  The pain had crippled me,  and taken me from the day to day lives of my children.
Since beginning treatment with Dr Connor,  almost a year ago now, I feel ALIVE again!  My children have their father back,  and i have hope!  I have my life back.  Words truly cannot express my gratitude to Dr Connor. She is the best doctor i have EVER been associated with!! She is an angel from heaven here to help those in need!|ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT! Dr. Connor and her staff are the best! They treat you like family! No other Dr cares more for her patients than her! I wish she was still in business. I miss her.

I've never had a doctor actually sit down with me and have such a caring attitude towards how we were going to tackle my specific pain management, how I would like to go about easing my pain for long periods of time without making me where I cannot function or drive and didn't just throw medication at me and tell me she'd see me a month. She actually cares about her patients, even if it is not pain related!  She takes her precious very planned out time to give you names of great physicians for other medical problems that have better reputations than other offices that I've seen in the past. What a sweet lady she is!|Dr. Horne and her staff are absolutely amazing.  Dr. Horne has gone an extra mile trying to help relieve my ungodly back pain. I'm praying these blocks work.

Told them it was getting worse. I have never had to deal with pain before and don't know what is needed for this.
I have yet to receive a call back. This has been over about 2 months. The staff never returns your calls so obviously they don't care.|Dr. HORN, is honest, authentic and kind at the same time. 2nd visit- she gave me her opinion for surgery which i did on an out patient basis. I spent years suffering, afraid of what the surgery would intell. It was completed and I'm on my way to recovery. She knew!!!|This female doctor saved me. I had been prescribed medication for pain for a bulging disc. This has been a few years back, but she was absolutely amazing. Total transparency, I had never needed pain medication before I had problems with my back. I was in my mid forties. I was running a business at the time, and had no time to take off for surgery. Until I had to!

The Doctor, she told me, "" one day you're going to be down at the beach or out in the yard and that disc is going to rupture!""  And she wasn't wrong. I was on a boat over in Atlanta on Lake Lanier. We hit wake and I went up and bounced down.

On the way home from my legs went numb and were aching all the way to my feet. I had surgery the following Friday spinal fusion.

These people were amazing. They took care of me made sure I had medication for maintenance and breakthrough pain for three months. That is the amount of time it took to re-habilitate after having an XLIF procedure.

My surgeon was in touch with them and they adjusted my medication as needed.

I just wanted to take a moment to say in all fairness, you do your part, and they do theirs. You have to be honest and you have to take your medication as prescribed. I will say this, when I was in more pain than I realized, they adjusted, as I stated above. And when I got better, I came off that medicine.

But while I was there, they treated me with respect and dignity, and I never had one problem with anyone working there. This doctor and her staff helped me an and did an amazing job.

That was in 2018. I'm not sure how things work now since the law has changed so much. But having not taken a pain pill since 2018, I can say while I was there, they made my life so much better. People and chronic pain deserve their pain medication when they are hurting.

Not everyone is looking for a daily high. But sadly, I hear these days US-wide, the good must suffer with the bad. And that the DEA have changed the laws and not in favor of chronic pain patients.

Despite it all, These people were an absolute saving grace for me. Thank you.|Bad experience today with a Rude Nurse. I had to withdraw myself as a patient.

He always listens to his patients. Right after my husband passed my sons was very concerned about me getting the injections in my neck and lower back. He took time out of his very busy schedule to explain the procedure to them and to inform them that he would take very good care of me when administering them. He's the best!|Dr. Herrick was referred to me by a friend. He told me that Herrick was not only a great Doctor but also a great person. He was right! Dr.Herrick was able to treat my pain,without heavy medication or surgery. He gave me a series of trigger point injections and spinal epidural injections and I've never felt better. He is a calming force as well. I highly recommend Dr. Herrick.|Dr. Herrick is amazing. I was seeing another Doctor before him and the experience with Dr. Herrick far exceeds my expectations. I felt safe, comfortable, and secure. He talked me through the whole procedure and he was gentle. The spine is a scary place to have needles and he made me calm. For the last year I have questioned my previous Doctor integrity. Its nice to know that this Doctor is always smiling and joyful. The last thing I need is an upset Doctor sticking a needle in spine.|I would like to say that everytime that I have gone to Dr Herrick, he has been more than marvelous.  He pays attention to just where he is putting the great healer into my back or knee's.  The first time that I went to him he shot me in the back and they called me after it had been only a week and a half and I told them that the pain was 95% gone and that is when they told me to come back.  While I was there I asked him if he shot the knee's.  And He expressed an opinion that I really liked.  He told me to set up an appointment in a month and I did and it was great.  I think that David Herrick is a great doctor!|In my opinion, a doctor's staff reflects heavily on the doctor. The staff at the Montgomery South location were unprofessional and rude.  I do not feel that adequate attention and patient care was given to my husband when he had a reaction to a procedure performed.  My complaint to the office manager/clinical director was all but dismissed.  .

We were not given an after-hour phone number and had no way of contacting the doctor who preformed the procedure when something went wrong.  The responsibility of a complication should not be on the ER when the performing doctor's office is open.

The quality of care received was terrible.  Our experience at the Montgomery South location was repugnant.|Pain is a tough business.  Everyone has different levels of it and everyone wants it to go away.  I have been seeing Dr. Herrick for over 5 years.  He is not only an artist at his trait, he is eager to help each patient he sees.  I read the negative reviews and have to wonder if they just didn't get what they expected vs. what they needed.  I am not pain free, but I am able to manage the pain of multiple back surgeries due to his help, and foremost, guidance.  I can't put myself in other people position so it's understandable that making all people happy all the time is simply inconceivable.  I know that for me personally, I would not be able to manage through even the most basic of daily regimens without the aid of Dr. Herrick.  Wonderful doctor, Great man!|The sad reality is this man who calls himself a doctor is an insider with what has evolved into an Alabama medical maffia. These doctors control the state medical board. These doctors use fear and intimidation on other doctors not in their club by wielding the power to threaten to have them sanctioned, or prosicuted for prescribing pain medication to chronic pain sufferers. The end result is the complete and total devastation of legitamate patients with chronic pain who have either lost, or will be losing the prescriptiion medications that have provided for them the relief from pain they require to maintain a modicum of quality of life. This tactic of course provides this new medical maffia with a monopoly to profit off the new Federal war on opiates to grow their personal practices into their own state sanctioned factories where their patients are managed like cattle on an assembly line. Cattle that live in fear that they might lose their pain medication if they complain about the lack of quality in the care they receive. Herrick and those like him are not doctors, but heartless pain profiteers.I have personally experienced Herrick's operation having had to take a family member to him. Further I have discussed the realities of my experiences with other doctors who have confided to me privately how things work in Alabama.|Dr David didn't listen to me or couldn't discern my bodies pain need as i told him of my 30 yr.left and 20 yr. Old right knee major operations, which both doctors said were NOT  permenat solutions,and instead sent me to have an MRI,cost 325.oo out of my pocket because he didn't check to see if my blue cross covered it or not, on my back!

He listens carefully and takes the time to explain what is likely generating pain.  He explains available options for treatment, realistic potential outcomes and any possible negative effects.  He is very skilled at placing injections exactly where they are going to do the most good.  He was able to dramatically reduce pain that has been part of my life for well over a decade.|Definitely would not recommend him.  My husband went for his hand. He wanted to put some  wires in his hand. I went for my knee he sad my urine was dirty . I told him I had went to E.R not even 24hrs before coming there.  He said naw it's not that.  First of all I don't do drugs nor am I around any one that does. It was so embarrassing for me. Plus they charge $40 Co pay. They like to do procedures cuz they get paid alot for them. They will write prescription for medication they get paid for that too, but you Definitely not getting no narcotic that helps your pain. That's for them yep its been over 4 years . I have no plans on coming back to that office ever|I wish it were possible to give them zero stars.They lied to us about getting insurance approval for procedures. Had they actually called our insurance provider like we were told they did, they would have been notified that we are out of network. Although their office staff told us repeatedly we were in network.

Now we are responsible for the entire bill. Their billing department eventually reached out to our insurance carrier after the claims were denied. Our insurance carrier informed them we are out of network a little too late. They never said anything to us. Instead, they just mailed out the bill, expecting prompt payment. The worst part of the ordeal was after all that money spent and procedures endured, the pain did not subside. Such a scam! Do yourself a favor and go to another physician. All they want is money and could care less about the patients. Will take advantage of anyone who walks through the door.|Not very helpful with my back pain. Gave pain medicine then said (in my records) he tried to get me to stop taking them which HE DID NOT!!
Epidurals did not help, but he claimed they did. Then had the wires put in and I was not able to even walk for several days. He took the wires out after three days. My husband said I was so much worse after trying that. My left leg is totally numb still after over one year.
I would not recommend him unless you're just wanting the pain pills.|I had a temporary Crotonix stimulator installed back in November 2023.

This Monday, as in 2 days ago, I called to make an appointment and the receptionist asked me when I would like to come in and I told her the sooner she had available. She said okay I have Wednesday available at 1:30. I said okay great that's perfect! So today I show up at 1:30, fill out my paperwork turn it in and go to the restroom.  Once I come out of the restroom one of the ladies tells me your appointment isn't until next Wednesday it's not today.....
Ummmmmm, EXCUSE ME??
I said well I called Monday and she asked me when I would like to be seen and I told her the earliest possible and she said Wednesday at 1:30. She didn't ever say anything about next week! EVER! So, a very madly grabbed my things from the lobby and walked out. Now I guess me working in customer service basically my entire life I would have never ever allowed this to happen to a customer! I would have never let them walk out and I would have fit them in because it wasn't even busy! I will let Dr M know and I'll also let him know how unprofessional they were at the front desk, blaring music, singing like they're at a concert. They are not the most professional looking ladies by far but good customer service goes a long way and they are lacking that!|Thank you so much for the great care Dr. Shirley Randall MD you've changed my life completely for the better. I am an extremely happy and healthy person now thanks to Dr. Shirley Randall MD and her entire wonderful staff great people thank you again. My name is Darren K I travel constantly, that is why I am traveling. Man on google, but thank you again. Your happy patient Darren K.|Ever since the first time I came to see Dr Mcalister he was always very friendly, knowledgeable, and effective. He has helped me tremendously with my chronic shoulder that no other doctor could ever get me relief. With the injections it has made it able to function on a day to day basis. I very very highly recommend this clinic for anyone is need of help.|First Dr. In 25 years that has truly treated my pain and not by medicine. He did a procedure called Facet Injections and they have changed my life.  For the first time in many years I can enjoy life almost pain free.  I was terrified of the injections and his amazing staff talked to me at length about how the procedure is done and what I could expect afterwards.  Highly recommend Eastern Shore Pain Management.|I had my daughter see Dr. Mc Allister for back pain associated with a Ski Racing injury. He was rude, condescending and verbally abusive to her. He refused to listen to her medical history and threw her out when she didn't know how to pronounce the medical terms of her previously diagnosed injuries from three years ago at age 15. Horrible experience for a young adult who has a diagnosed and preciously treated injury and is in pain. We were only looking for a PT referral, she was in tears leaving his office.|Never go to this doctor if you need pain relief. All he does is run unnecessary test or treatment you don't need. Only to be able to bill your insurance. He doesn't listen to you just talk all over you during exam.|Horrible physician! Very strange procedures in how to see people. I've been seeing pain doctors for over two years now, and this was the first place I've walked in, to which people didn't look like they were in CHRONIC PAIN whatsoever! If you don't get these 'injections' (which are NOT ADA certified, or are right for all patients) you're turned away. To me he is just a script writer.|The staff are very friendly and helpful.

On March mom was in car wreck broke her left leg and knee left wrist. She was in rehab until my baby brother died and I just cldn't leave  my mother at rehab after 2 months with no family member not being able to stay with her I just cldn't leave her there. So I brought her home. She still isn't able to walk on the left leg, but she didn't have pain meds to last more than a week. I called Mom pain mgt..Dr Matthew Bennett and try to explain our delima but they need to see her. Dr Matthew Bennett is her paint mgt. Even though I explained I wld have to drag her in my back car seat that seem not to matter. Ever her primary said he wld need to see her. So I drag her into the back seat of the car and drove her to pain mgt. They said that only do ambletory so no pain meds from them took her to Dr Robert Whitmore her primary I got the same stupid excuse from them. We haven't see her in 4 months. Now he cld have seen her bc after all she is in the hospital where he services, but chose not to go see her there either. So after all the dragging my mom in my back seat I got to bring her back home still no pain meds had to drag her back out of my back seat of my car to get her in the house. I can not believe mom has being seeing these Dr matther Bennett pain mgt and Dr whitmore her primary still wld not write mom enough pain pill for 3 days untill she see her surgens. I am so beside myself bc they didn't care how much mom was in pain just to help her. These Dr are in it more for the money and not the care of their patience.  Shame on them even though I took her so they cld see her still didn't matter. They wldn't write her a pain script.  I have called her surgon 4 or 5 times and haven't  had a call back from his office. The sad thing is my 85 yr old mother is the one suffering. I am so getting her a whole new set of doctors. Maybe they'll care about her well being.

I'm very grateful I found this clinic and look forward to continuing my care there.|After suffering from chronic pain and illness for over 10 years, I had almost given up hope of finding answers or relief. I spent thousands of dollars on various specialists, often waiting up to a year for appointments, only to be turned away without a clear diagnosis or helpful solutions. That all changed when I was referred to Alpenglow Pain and Wellness.

From my very first visit, I felt a sense of relief. The team at Alpenglow was compassionate, understanding, and truly dedicated to helping me find answers. Dr. Calor took the time to listen to my history and concerns, which made a world of difference. They conducted a thorough evaluation and were able to provide a clear diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan that finally addressed my pain.

The support I received was remarkable, and I felt like I was truly being cared for as a whole person, not just a set of symptoms. Thanks to their expertise and personalized approach, I am beginning to see improvements in my condition and reclaim my life.

I wholeheartedly recommend Alpenglow Pain and Wellness to anyone who has struggled with chronic pain and is looking for compassionate, effective care. Thank you for giving me hope and a path to healing!|Absolutely worst experience I have ever had in my life in a medical setting. I came in with excruciating pains after driving three hours just to make it to my appointment. Dr. Mary Beth saw me for maybe 10 minutes. Came in with a diagnosis packet already in hand and filled out her assessment sheet without even watching as she told me to show her different poses. When preforming ""assessments"" she half assed and even skipped actually doing what she said she was assessing. Then proceeded for the remainder of her time with me, to try to sell me a huge packet of a bunch of different prescriptions I should buy from them. Without once stopping to ask if I was okay (as I am shooting with pain and visibly crying and uncomfortable) or how bad my chronic pain is and is effecting my day to day life. When I asked about immediate pain management for day to day life, she said there was nothing she could do for me except prescribe a medication that would take months to build up before alleviating any pains. How can you call yourself a pain and wellness clinic?? This is honestly disgusting to have to put up with simply to get the resources necessary so I can go to someone more capable and compassionate to the patients lives and well-being they are caring for. I HIGHLY recommend NOT going to this clinic. It is very unfortunate that there are very few resources available for chronic pain and the ones we do have are money hungry businesses that don't give a crap about people's actual lives.|The first thing I want to address is their punctuality which Priscilla and the wonderful lady to her left helped me (apologies I was rude and didn't ask your name). My appointment was set for 12:15 and they saw me at 12:25  and in medical terms 10 minutes is nothing. Cynthia Dunleavy and Dua made my appointment feel very indivualized. I'm not a cog in a wheel. They listened, explained and were honest. They didn't catastrophize. Plus their office is clean and tidy and the music in the front office was great! Thank you alpenglow. I'll leave another review after my treatment|The office is super clean and the front desk workers were professional and very nice! I had Dr.Renk and she was super thorough with her evaluation/examination. Afterwords she was super informative and provided me with a good amount of written information to take home.

They are decreasing the amount of pain medication they allow patients. So on medication dose treats all! Whether your pain increases as they cut back on your medication THEY DON'T CARE!!
So if you have minor pain go to them, but if you have major chronic pain go somewhere else!!!! If you could rate them in negative numbers I'd give them a minus 5.|Drove all the way from Anchorage to be seen only to be refused because I did not show 30 minutes before my appointment. I think it's just asinine to make an appointment at a certain time but reality you need to be there 30 minutes sooner too much room for confusion. And then to be turned away after an hour drive is infuriating will not be going back. Will be finding a new Dr, somebody that is a little more realistic and understands our time is just as important as theirs.|Vince Perino at Algone has changed my life over the past year. He listened and continues to listen to my concerns. He monitors my medication to make sure dependency doesn't become an issue.

I would highly recommend Algone(especially Vince) if your in pain and need assistance getting back to the point where you can live life again!|Algone used to be an amazing practice, however, since Drs. Grissom & Peterson left the practice, Algone has gone downhill!!! I wouldn't recommend Algone to anyone!!!|Dr. Grissom was the best! Had been with him for almost 20 years. Then comes the new owners. They are paranoid about pain med abuse, in which I don't deny happens. However, for people like me that need pain management without abusing this is not the place to go. I had a wrong pain med count and had to sign papers on it, which flagged me. The situation was resolved in my favor. However, I was put on a patch that is for abusers. Which did not even help with the pain. I loved and miss Luda. With the owners being MD's they  are over her decisions. So she could not help me with the situation that I had been put in.|I have never experienced the extremely inflated level of customer service & patient care in my life like I have from this office. Talk about way above and far beyond any reasonable expectations! Tammy went way beyond any thing I could reasonably expect someone to do to get me the answers that I needed.

At Algone they treat me like a human and the only time I'm not referred to by name is when there is new staff.
I truly couldn't be happier.|I appreciated the opportunity to have assistance from algone. The Dr assigned to me was incredibly knowledgeable about my condition and my journey. The medical assistant that roomed me was simply rude. The Dr gets a 5 star for attention to detail and unfortunately the support staff appear to have little patience and/or ability to deal with those with complex medical conditions. They get a negative rating. When I called to decline further assistance the gentleman continued the lack of care. He simply asked if I was breaking contact!? I told him that I had one visit and a failed med trial. My only option left is an implanted nerve stimulator and that I was not ready to go that route. He simply stopped talking and hung up. Rude and disrespectful at best. I simply ended the dr patient relationship and never breached my contract. Absolutely disgusting.

I was also given a packet of information about other things I could do to help myself
I used to have to beg Dr.s to tell me what I could do to help myself- Most of them didn't understand the diagnosis or have any idea what I could do to Improve my Health. I was told there is a Strong and supportive network for my Healthcare needs.

HE implied that we were selling the tramadol. We have been gone from them for almost two years now we get a bill for over 100 dollars. The Doctor has so many patience's that he really don't have quality time since he's lining his pockets with different t services he can have you purchase. Not a good fit for us.|Dr. Gay and his staff are the utmost professionals in all they do.  Dr. Gay isn't the kind of doctor that will just willy-nilly  ""give you a shot"" and send you on your way--or settle on a series of shots.  Dr. Gay assesses your entire situation and determines, together with you, the patient, the best course of action--each time you visit--to augment your primary care provider/surgeon's treatment plan.  Professional, down-to-Earth, friendly, accommodating environment providing you with top-quality care--can't ask for more than that.|I live in Fairbanks and was not a current patient of Dr. Gay's when he agreed to see me this past January. I have a herniated disk at the L5/S1 region that elevated into severe sciatica. After seeing various pain, neurological, and orthopedic doctors in Fairbanks, and all agreeing I needed an epidural steroid injection (ESI), not one would flex their schedule or work me in for the procedure for 1 to 3 weeks later.
After being in the worst pain of my life for 3 weeks straight already, I knew I could not wait this long. I ended up in the ER when someone my husband knew recommended calling Dr.Gay's office as they had recently seen him for a similar issue. He agreed to see me the next day (which was his day off) to do the ESI procedure. He took the time to explain everything to me and never once did I feel rushed. After the procedure was complete I immediately felt relief, which continued to improve over the subsequent week.
I wish more doctors shared his compassion and humble nature.  Dr. Gay's staff went over and above to accommodate my emergent need, and I cannot thank the whole team enough.|I contacted Dr. Gay's office because I was in a great deal of discomfort. Abigail was so accommodating and was able work work me into their Wasilla office in a couple of days. When I met with Dr. Gay and he did the examination he was able to determine what the issue was and we decided to go with a cortisone injection. He actually follows up with you and when he did, I explained about 60% improvement. He then said we could follow up with a second injection. Because I was leaving for the winter they made sure to fit me in before I left. Again, he followed up and I was pleased to tell him the 2nd injection did the trick!
His entire staff is beyond amazing and caring! Thank you Dr.Gay, Abigail, Latasha and Eli!|Dr. Gay is kind and compassionate and he listens. I am on my 4th apt with him and have always been impressed with his bedside nature and his plans for action.

After I completed two appointments it was denied by insurance and I was left with a $500 bill. They could have checked first to see if it was in fact covered rather than confidently telling me it was. Of note, I have phenomenal mental health coverage and I have not found another provider in the state who does not take my insurance for counseling. Also, refused to admit any error on their part.|Unprofessional, heartless - was messaged regarding pain management by my doctor. I had previously indicated that this could be an issue since I worked with them previously - I made mention of this on the phone call where they were able to get me on the schedule - I get into the office and fill out their paperwork after a month and a half dealing with pain at this level only to be told that I'm not going to be seen today due to said previous relationship.

This could have been addressed before I made it into the office - this could have been addressed before I had weeks of pain. This could have been addressed so that I could get to an office that will actually do their job. Instead they have wasted my time, wasted my energy, and being told that I will not be seen even though I've been on their books was a low blow.

As a chiropractor who would refer to clinics for patients in need - should I ever get to a point where I'm able to practice again without being in such pain that it impacts my work, I will never refer or recommend anyone to AA Spine and Pain clinic.|I am a previous patient who has returned to AA Pain and Wellness after my original provider retired. Despite initial concerns, I have found a new medical home with Dr. Lonsor. He is thorough and transparent in his care approach, always ensuring the best treatment within established guidelines. His team also exemplifies his commitment, even during busy periods.
My most recent procedure was highly successful, allowing me to engage in moderate activities without experiencing pain.|I recently had an outstanding experience at AA Spine and Pain Clinic, and I want to share my positive feedback. When I made my appointment over the phone with Alysa, I was impressed by her dedication. She went above and beyond, searching for cancellations and promptly calling me back the same afternoon with an earlier slot. While I understand that not everyone may be able to get scheduled as quickly, I'm immensely grateful for her exceptional efforts to accommodate my needs.  I was seen much sooner than the initially scheduled two-week wait.

Candace was efficient in gathering all the necessary details, ensuring a smooth transfer of knowledge when the doctor arrived. Katie, the practice manager, deserves recognition. Katie's kind bedside manner instilled confidence they could alleviate my pain.  Her proactive approach was evident when she worked directly with the VA to expedite my procedure.

Overall, I am stunned Anchorage has this level of service, and seamless coordination among the staff. Thank you to specifically these three for making my experience so positive. Highly recommended!|The experience with the service provided was less than satisfactory. Despite encountering numerous challenges during the process of scheduling an appointment, including a lack of communication regarding the enrollment link for the patient portal, I took the initiative to independently seek out the necessary information online. The subsequent visit for the appointment was further marred by a sense of frustration displayed by the front desk clerk, which left me feeling disappointed in the level of patient service and guidance that was extended. A gentlemen (patient) also was there after he saw what I was saying also expressed to me that he was also having issues.|Scheduling my surgeries with Michelle was a breeze. She always makes me feel so comfortable, she called me two days before my surgery to let me know my post op prescription was ready and to let me know I am in good hands with the doctors. She made the entire process so easy. I think the staff at AA Spine Clinic is great but Michelle and Dr. Gama are a dynamic duo!! Keep up the amazing service that you provide to your patients each and everyday!!|AA Spine & Pain Clinic is the best place to go if you have pain issues. Dr. Johnston is amazing! The team always provides the best care and makes sure I am heard. Dr. Lonser is also great, and today the medical tech, Candace was THE BEST! She was so kind and listened and made the experience less stressful for me (back injection). Also, I didn't catch her name - maybe Alyssa? - whoever was at the front desk today is the sunniest person ever. When I called back later with a question, she was so pleasant and helpful. What great employees you have with these two support ladies! TOP NOTCH!|The staff here is the BEST I've EVER had the pleasure of being a patient with.  Dr. Lonzer is super great!

I recently had the privilege of receiving treatment from Dr. Urban at Urban Pain Institute, and I am compelled to share my remarkable experience. From the moment I walked through the door, I knew I was in the right hands.
The customer service at Urban Pain Institute is unparalleled. The staff were not only professional and courteous but also incredibly accommodating. They went above and beyond to ensure that I felt comfortable and well-informed throughout my entire journey. One thing that truly stood out was the promptness of their responses. In today's fast-paced world, it's refreshing to find a medical team that values your time. Every question I had was answered promptly, either in person or via phone and text, which made me feel like a valued patient. Dr. Urban demonstrated a level of compassion that I very much appreciate. His empathy and understanding of my concerns made a world of difference. He took the time to thoroughly explain my condition, the recommended procedure, and all available treatment options. This compassionate approach eased my anxieties and built trust from the start. The medical procedure itself was nothing short of remarkable. Dr. Urban and his team were not only highly skilled but also exceptionally attentive. They made sure I was comfortable every step of the way, which was incredibly reassuring. I felt like my well-being was their top priority. Now, the results have exceeded my wildest expectations. I honestly didn't think it was possible to feel this good again. Dr. Urban's expertise and precision in his work are truly admirable. My quality of life has improved significantly, and I am grateful beyond words. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Dr. Urban, Adam and Tiffany along with the entire team at Urban Pain Institute enough. Their outstanding customer service, prompt responses, compassionate care, and remarkable results make them the top choice for anyone seeking spine treatment. If you're looking for a spine specialist, your search ends here. Thank you.|I've had 5 back surgeries throughout the years due to work injury. I've been to a few different pain doctors throughout the years that in my opinion tended to settle with the fact that there's not much more that can be done but use pain pills to deal with my pain.

I've been seeing Dr. Urban and his staff for several years now and actually have found relief from the pain because of what Dr. Urban has been able to do for me and continues to do.

I've always felt comfortable with seeing Dr. Urban, not only because i think he does great work but also because of the professional staff he has on hand. They've always been respectful and helpful.

You won't be sorry unless you don't go see Dr. Urban.|My chronic pain was taken seriously. I was heard by Doctor Urban. The nursing staff is incredibly kind and checked in on me the day after both procedures. I had an initial appointment followed by two procedures all within 8 days. I am beyond ecstatic and truly shocked at how quickly they got me in and treated my pain. I have never been treated so quickly or so kindly.  Doctor Urban also had phenomenal bedside manner. He made me laugh many times but also repeatedly made sure I was ok during the procedures. I think that he truly is an exceptional doctor. After years of pain I have hope of being able to live a pain free life. I couldn't be happier with every part of their services and how exceptionally kind they are. I am so grateful for this experience.|Highly recommended Urban Pain Institute. Dr. Urban, Adam, and the entire staff at Urban Pain Institute go above and beyond to assist the patient. Dr. Urban listens to patient concerns and addresses them. Adam exceeds expectations regarding customer assistance. Demonstrating the upmost professionalism, he guides patients through the absolutely confusing insurance company guidelines addressing patient concerns along the way. The young lady that works the front desk is always a pleasure. The young lady that preps patients for surgery is kind. She demonstrates concern regarding the patients comfortability and after procedure care. As stated above, the entire staff are excellent. Thank you!|Been seen by Dr Urban and team for years.

They have helped me twice now with nerve pain (after two different surgeries) and I really appreciate that Dr. Liu and his team care about each of the patients that come through his office. Thank you Neuroversion team!|Dr. Liu is ahead ah mazing. He checked on my Mom every evening during her hospital! Again, a great surgeon and caring doctor!|My first visit started at the front desk & they welcomed me with open arms & made it much easier to open up to my new Doctor.|I see this review process only as a way for whomever is responding to get the last word and besmirch any naysayers. The fact of the matter is, if you don't fit the mold they're looking for it's not going to work. I have each visit I've been to recorded, this particular Dr absolutely looked me straight in the face and lied. The two visits were so desperately different I thought I'd lost my mind. I, family (mom's a doc), and other medical providers have listened to the recordings, all assured me I was professionally gaslighted. If it was a movie he would get 100% rotten tomatoes, sadly it's my life. I was criticized for crying, obviously I was confused and had been sitting in a wooden chair for 2 hrs in severe pain waiting for all this fun to start. The nurse took me to the room explaining she'd get my urine as I was leaving. We had passed the bathroom
and she was kind enough to notice the intense pain I was in so ""we'll just do it on your way out"". The first thing he asks when he walks in ""why did you refuse to UA""?  I immediately became defensive, how rude. This is when the visit just turned into absolute ""story time"" claiming what he was saying was all in my chart. Well bravo!!!  I can put anything I want into a chart too. The odd thing it just doesn't match the recording. I have a very serious, extremely painful condition that can be somewhat controlled with a regimen of meds, only one a narcotic. The funniest part of all, I was asking for a pain pump which often removes the need for any other narcotic. So if I'm drug seeking yet begging for a pain pump....makes no sense. He stated I was unreliable, irresponsible and that he only does pain pumps for those he will go above and beyond for and I'm not one of the chosen. I have drug use in my past, no problem admitting this. He told me a few years ago to get clean and we could talk. I did as he asked but was told my clean time wasn't impressive, just a snap's worth of time. Any recovering addicts out there know 24 hrs is humongous but I was headed toward 3 yrs. Can't do any better than that. The answers to the bad reviews flip the story back onto the patient, psychosocial bull, socioeconomics causing our ""outbursts"". We need therapy or to find something better to do with our time. Well I'm doing exactly what my therapist told me to do. I have a life, limited as it is, you do not occupy anymore of my time than it took to write this. You let a person barely able to stand, crying, visibly shaken to the point driving should have been discouraged walk right out your door with no more compassion you'd give a mosquito. Some of us have had every injection known to mankind, every procedure you can name yet our conditions persist well beyond tolerable for any human. This man even told me I have one of the most painful conditions a human can have. In the literature it is compared to stage 4 metastatic cancer. At first I thought you were just an odd duck, but you are truly cruel, judgemental, dishonest and thoroughly cold hearted.....unless you feel like going ""above and beyond"". There is truly something wrong with you. Respond if you just can't stand not to but it's not worth it. Every last word spoken at each visit was legally recorded and put out for people to hear. Shame on you.|I've been a patient of Dr. Ekstrom and Medical Assistant Isaac for almost a year now, and they have always been so compassionate and so positive every single interaction even not at my best.

We've had a great treatment plans and things intact to help my day to day be as good as they can be with the unfortunate genetics i have haha!

I can't thank them enough, his MA Isaac is always on it, always communicative and super effective at his job.
They're definitely a power duo
and my interactions with everyone else as well at Neuroversion after my injection and every visit has been nothing short than fantastic!!

Thank you all for all that you do and everything that you have to deal with.
:) Hannah|My husband and I love the provider's at Neuroversion!  They cared for my husband based on his individual health and pain needs!
They genuinely care about their patient's, and take their oath as a Physician to heart!
The only problem with being as good as they are! When you're in real bad pain and lack of sleep, you have to wait to get help!
I still wouldn't go anywhere else!|Everything about this office is wonderful. I don't have to wait very long for my appointment. And the staff is really sweet and very caring. Dr. Lui is the best. I went to 3 other Doctors before him and none of them were as good him. I'm so happy I was referred to him. I always see his P.A. and that would be Jamie Lytton.

His staff was efficient and quick to get us in. Dr.Kropp was very personable with our youngest and professional. Acknowledged and walked us through what our son was experiencing. Highly recommend and very appreciative of his care. We value his expertise in this specialty.|Dr. Kropp and his entire office are absolutely top notch--I cannot recommend them enough! I absolutely love the personality of everyone who works there, and Dr. Kropp is so warm and welcoming! Quick backstory, I'm only 35 but was diagnosed in my mid-20s with mild scoliosis and early degenerative disc disease, so ive had quite a few back related issues over the last 10-15 years. I've seen Dr. Kropp three times: the first time, we discovered I had a ruptured disc and he was honest with me, explaining why injection likely wouldn't be useful for me at that point and referred me to my wonderful neurosurgeon; the second time, I needed injections into my neck because I'd been carrying tension for over a year due to overcompensating from my back surgery; and the most recent time, today, was due to a 1.5-year-long muscle knot that was also causing a bulging disc/narrowing nerve canal, so I was injected into both the disc and the muscle knot with the goal of fixing the issue at its source. All three times, Dr. Kropp has given me and my husband very thorough explanations of why he does what he does, what he thinks will work best, yet always ultimately leaves the decision up to me (no surprise, I always take his suggestions because they make complete sense after he explains them). I also really enjoy hearing Dr. Kropp's personal anecdotes with back pain/surgeries; he's very down-to-earth and easy to talk to, and knowing that he has personally experienced the pains I'm having makes me feel very heard and understood. The injection process is very thorough, clean, and as comfortable as it can possibly be--getting a needle stuck into your back isn't exactly a ""fun"" experience in the moment, but the process is so short and Dr. Kropp and his assistant are so kind and encouraging that it's absolutely worth the couple minutes of mild discomfort for the lasting relief it provides. My husband and I always leave the office talking about how wonderful everyone was. Like I told the doctor today, I don't see Dr. Kropp often, but man am I beyond grateful he's here when I do need him! Truly cannot recommend him enough!|Dr. Kropp is a UNICORN! Groundbreakingly good at his job AND legitimately filled with compassion for his patients. He has been treating my severe chronic pain successfully for 7 years. Without his help I would not have been able to keep working all these years. He treats me without risking addiction. Without causing lots of damage or scaring. And always without stressing me out. If you want a strong team member in your fight to STAY healthy and functional, you'll never find a better partner than Dr. Kropp. He really gets it!|I had neck surgery in March. C 5/6 fusion. I felt way better after the surgery, but had lingering pain in my neck. Dr. Kropp and his staff made sure that they listened to me and carefully explained the procedure. I walked into a clean and modern office, and was handed a tabled for the initial paperwork. It was super easy to use and took less than five minutes to complete. I was immediately taken back to the prep room and within minutes after that, I was on the procedure table. Dr. Kropp administered the sedation, and I barely felt a thing. They gave me a soda to help wake me up and I was out of the office about fifteen minutes later. Overall, in and out in about a half hour. My discharge instructions with my follow up appointment was already in my email with a quick and easy link to talk to Dr. Kropp again. The procedure was such a success, that we decided to do it on the other side of my neck. It can be a fluke for something to go so right, but the next time I went back, it was just as easy. If you are having pain that Dr. Kropp thinks he can treat, you owe it to yourself to try this.|I have been a patient of Dr. Kropp's for over 10 years and there isn't any doctor I trust more to treat my back pain.  He is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, kind, and positive.  I've seen a lot of doctors and he has, by far, the best bedside manner of any specialist I've ever been to.  It is evident that he really cares and he won't recommend treatments unless he fully believes they will be beneficial.  His office is run efficiently and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  It is a very calming atmosphere.  I sing his praises to anyone I meet who is suffering from back or neck pain.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!|Amazing experience. Great staff. No one likes to be told they need a lumbar procedure but if you do he's the guy to see. The in-office procedure was quick, painless, easy and even pleasant. I almost wish it had taken longer just because Dr. Kropp and his staff were so personable. I was put at ease straightaway. He was very thorough in his assessment and answered all of my questions with patience and care. He walked me thru my imaging, the procedure, after-care and long-term goals/outlook beforehand. If I have to do it again I'll definitely go thru Dr. Kropp but he was so efficient and professional one visit has probably done the trick!|I don't recommend this practice and I will not returning in the future. The office is clean and the staff is nice but I have had a horrible experience. I was supposed to be sedated (as was previously discussed, agreed upon, and documented) for the procedure but had the needle in my back without being sedated and with no warning. I was courteous about it and didn't complain. During the follow up to the procedure Dr. Kropp called me a liar when I was trying to describe the state of my back the day after the procedure. I feel completely disrespected and cannot put any faith into Dr. Kropp moving forward.|I can't say enough about these guys! Very efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. Their office staff are the most friendly and on it that I have encountered in Anchorage. The entire staff went above and beyond to accommodate my situation.  Dr Kropp himself is easy to like and made me feel comfortable right from our first conversation. He explained my procedure and answered all my questions with patience.

During our consultation he seemed to understand I was in a lot of pain and saw the MRIs which indicate a surgical intervention by an orthopedic surgeon. After talking about what I've tried and what has worked and not worked in the past we agreed on a medication so I could function  until surgery.   To my surprise when I filled my medication it wasn't at all what we talked about.  One of the medications I was allergic to, one was the wrong form so I couldn't take it and one was a psych med. Dr. Musa isn't a psychiatrist and it felt like he was saying that I'm crazy and the pain is in your head.  There was no discussion about mental health during the consultation.   None of these medications were discussed and they knew my allergies.  I called multiple times to try and find out what I could do since these weren't the medications we talked about and then I got an email telling me that he could no longer treat me. I have never been treated so poorly by a doctor before.  A warning to those who might seek his help; he'll lie to your face, gaslight you and fire you as a patient if you persist.|Was referred by my doctor to these people, from the beginning it was a disaster with them. Most unorganized dysfunctional pain clinic I've ever dealt with. Wound up going to Algone in Wasilla because after they had seen me twice after they just wouldn't answer the phone and I had to just go down there. Walked in and they wanted to collecta urinalysis sample... all good and fine I guess. And then, nothing for weeks. I call and call and no answer. Friday came around and I was fed up and went down there. 3:00pm in the after as I'm waking up to the door, gal comes out saying that they are closing early. Got a call back on Monday first thing nig the morning. They told me that my insurance was taking too long for authorization. I have Medicare and Medicaid, I've never had an issue before. Don't have an issue now with them now that I go out to the valley because it's not the same company. Spoke with Algone in Wasilla and they said that they had never heard of a clinic doing that; that they only share the name and are not actually part of the Anchorage practice at all. Avoid the headache if possible...|Don't waste your time. The staff is incompetent and the Dr treats you like a drug seeker. He knocked my pain medicine in half the first day I met him after being on it for 7 years and refused to put it back. Started using kratom to substitute the loss and was penalized and then taken off all my meds. I have never in my life struggled with the terrible Healthcare that I have received since being in alaska. If this office has given you grief as well, please report them or these Drs will continue to give substandard care. It is unacceptable medical behavior.|I am so blessed to have found Algone and especially Doctor Musa. My visits have been great, very thorough which I like and understand. Since I found Doctor Musa and Algone, I can finally say how much better I finally feel. The injuries were rough, but the care I've received from Algone has been amazing and professional. I highly recommend them, and Doctor Musa. Thank you Algone!|The physician is absolutely fantastic, the office staff appear unable to complete their jobs either based on knowledge or understaffing and thus have cost us a tremendous amount of money, time and stress. We are now having to start over with a new physician exclusively based on the office staff deficiency.|Algone is to pushy with sending patients Emails & phone calls about filling out questions before appointments.  This was too much for me they keep calling L/M. Or sent
me texts over  & over again. I called Algone about this repeatedly problem. They just never listened to the issue or cared. Staff unprofessional.
I was very disappointed with their office procedures and how they treated me. I had one appointment and it was a nightmare.  Never again|I had a positive experience at Algone Pain Management. This was my first appointment and it was calming and very nice to have a friendly staff to receive my wife and I. Dr. Musa was prepared for me and asked the questions that got to heart of my pain. Dr. Musa's knowledge of my spinal issues showed to me that he is very experienced. I trust the plan for medication and a spinal nerve block. My Dr. never spoke down to me and if there was something I didn't understand he was patient  and repeated a sentence. Dr. Musa covered a lot of ground and I was able to understand and remember most of everything. The nurse was very patient of me and my concerns. I struggle with chronic pain and sleep is an issue  so my comprehension and my mood is murky most days, the staff looked past this and treated me with respect.|I am a current patient here and I have to express how happy I am to have found Dr. Musa and the rest at Algon.

I was at my wits end seeing pain management docs, changing medication or insisting on alternative treatments that I had already tried. I tried anything and everything just so that I could get through the working day. Dr. McAnally was the first pain doc that sat down and listened and more importantly, believed and trusted me. The world of pain management is full of distrust for many good reasons. Dr. McAnally saw ""me"", and got to know me. He took that precious time for me. That kind of care can be a rare thing for doctors that deal with pain. They have to be wary of drug seeking patients. There are feeling of shame when you have chronic pain and need medication to help live your life, get your joy and happiness back instead of being stuck in bed holding your breath through pain. This is the norm for Dr. McAnally. He is an amazing doctor and human being who truly cares for his patients. I cannot say enough good things about him as well as his nurses, nurse practitioners, and med students and office staff. I thank them all from the bottom of my heart and spine.|When we moved to Alaska in 2012 I was on a lot of pain meds for a serious neck injury. Several surgeries and numerous procedures barely touched my pain. A year in Alaska brought more meds. I became a zombie. I could not function. Could not drive. I saw Dr Jones who asked if I would see Dr. McAnally for pain management. With a copy of all the meds that were prescribed for me, Dr. McAnally took one look and said that if I stayed with him he would knock holes in my meds. I thought he would reduce my dependency on some of the items. Months later with only one of my meds still in use he said that I didn't need it and explained how drugs become responsible for causing dependency.I really believed that I needed that pill but I also knew that every medication that he had eliminated from my list was good . I was feeling like myself again so I said ""ok, you've been right about everything so far, so I'll trust you to quit it"". 10 years later I have that bottle with all the pills still in it.

I had the best experience and then the best outcome one could hope for. I had RFA done in my lumbar area, without sedation, but with nice conversation, good music, great care, and for the first time in a very long time I am pain free. I feel unburdened. So to Dr. McAnnally, Jeannie, Breanna, Sam, and all the others who were so very nice, thank you for this wonderful gift. (I'll miss seeing you all, though.)|As a physician I have a liability being a patient; knowing all of the complications of procedures and the risks involved.  As a long time Chief Medical Officer, I been responsible for patient safety and maintaining standards of care.   Receiving care from Dr. McAnally and his staff was a fantastic experience.  I received a comprehensive anatomy and physiology lesson which was very helpful, and was well cared for.
Very very bright and compassionate physician, to say the least.  I was so impressed with the staff that I will have trouble resisting attempting to recruit a few away.
You really cannot go wrong being Dr. McAnally's patient.  I recommend him highly.  He really saved me from a miserable situation.|When I started at Napm seven years ago I was very sick (physically) , I met Dr Macanally he spent two hours with me my first appointment trying to help me figure out what was wrong and how best to fix it . After several referrals and many after hours calls I was finally on my way to starting to feel better. Dr Macanally always made me feel like he really was concerned about my well being , but also the well being of our communities. I never wanted to be on Pain management in the first place but seven spine surgeries-- you are definitely on pain meds .  He managed my pain never over medicated which I have always valued . He was always so conservative with dosing . I didn't want to be a statistic while trying to recover from my terrible situation. I didn't want to have to take pain meds for the rest of my life either . With the assistance of the classes offered at Napm by Donna I learned about pain and how my body and brain don't always work together, that my brain can trick my body and sometimes pain medicine can make it worse not better . I successfully was able to have my final
7th surgery a lumbar fusion and after a slow wean I was able to get off pain medicine, it's been over a year an half and I haven't wanted pain medicine once . I have my life back and I am 100% positive I wouldn't be where I am today without Dr Macanally! THANK YOU HEATH!!|I highly recommend Dr. McAnally. He is kind, his knowledge is extensive and he is very helpful. He was well prepared before my visit. The MRI and my medical history had already been reviewed in detail. Dr. McAnally spent quality time with my physical exam, listening to my medical history and then was able to give his professional advice. He gave me options and advice on medications, specific books regarding health/exercises, natural methods for my health and explained medical procedures that may help in the future. I have a complicated medical condition so I was grateful for the variety of options and they were gently introduced to me. He continues to respond promptly to my medical needs. My experience has been nothing but positive!|I had the best experience I could have in a Doctor's office. Not only was the entire staff kind, MD Mcanally provided utmost comfort, support and advice. Although my issue isn't yet fixed I am hopeful and it's nice being seen and heard.|I had the fortune of discovering Northern Anesthesia and Pain Medicine back in 2013 after having gone to another pain management facility in the Valley for back pain. I was not happy with the other facility as the billing was completely upside down and I was getting a bill (this happened for several months) despite having insurance and no one at this other place seemed able to do anything. I finally I decided I had had enough, talk about a real pain in the bottom!
The treatment I received from Dr. McAnally (Dr. Mac) and his staff was so much different compared to what I was used to getting, I felt like they saw me vs just a chart; they listened to what I wanted. I always have too much to do so I've always opted to have the ""nerves burnt in my back"" and the first time I had this done it was not like the other facility, it was much more in depth and I do not need to go back as frequently.
However, that does not mean the staff does not remember me or my children because they do and it's a great feeling when you walk into a place (regardless of how long it's been) and they remember you and ask about you and your family. If you ever find yourself in need of pain management, hands down, Northern Anesthesia and Pain Medicine is probably the most caring, compassionate, and professional pain management place out there! Not enough can be said about Dr. Mac and his staff, love, love, love them!|Doctor McAnally has been a life saver for me.  I first started seeing him for lower back pain due to a fractured sacrum a few years ago. Doctor McAnally strives to find what is best for any patient.  He honestly finds the cause of the pain then treat the pain the best way possible.  I can not express enough how great of an experience it has been, being one of his many patients.  I trust his medical opinion above any other Doctor I have ever seen.  Everyone at NAPM is awesome, thank you all so much!|I've had three epidural lumbar spinal steroid shots at Northern Anesthesia for a pinched nerve in my back causing radiating nerve pain down my leg.  The procedure is a bit uncomfortable considering you are getting a shot in your back but overall, it was relatively painless even without sedation.  You just need to relax and breathe during it.   Dr. McAnally is excellent and really knows what he's doing.  His staff is very organized and friendly.  They always follow through by calling to check up on you.  I highly recommend Northern Anesthesia, Dr. McAnally is a very knowledgeable doctor and I felt safe under his care.",2020-09-19|2015-02-18|2020-09-04|2015-02-10|2024-01-14|2017-11-10|2016-02-15|2015-09-15,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJddtQCHTryFYRkLslgpaLJzg,20

I have seen three Doctors and two PAs since 2012 and traveled back and forth to Anchorage every month and it was good at times because I was able to go to Costco etc... But finally they opened a clinic in Wasilla and I was excited because I new there was a chance I wouldn't have to make that drive every month. And my first visit was nice just meeting the staff and Greg my new PA, and honestly I was so taken back with the knowledge that he was speaking to me about my physical problems that were going on in my body, and the cause of why I'm hurting in so many different parts of my body, that were related to my injuries it really blew my mind.  Of all the years I have been going to AA spine clinic God has sent a Man of faith that cares so much about me to describe everything I felt was happening to my body!!!! In all my many years I'm so thankful and blessed that God has finally put someone in front of me that actually cares about my wellbeing and I'm not just a number.. I just read up on Greg to find out a bit more about who he is and his medical background like I do with every DR or PA I have ever gone to. And to learn that he is a God loving person was so refreshing. my heavenly father is my creator, and his Son Jesus is my savior and I take it very seriously when I have to put my life into someone else's hands .. Jesus is my guide to everything and my roadmap and I'm so happy and blessed that he has finally put my wellbeing in a Man of faith with the staff at AA spine clinic|I am actually shared patient with both doctors in the office. I have enjoyed talking to both. I went into surgery for a long time and came out of the hospital overwhelmed and extremely concerned about my opoid intake. I was sat down and reassured they listened to what I was worried about and let me know they were going to help me and my mental health team. It was mostly just paranoia on my part but I felt comfortable sharing what to me felt like crazy thoughts from my hospital stay not my clinic visits. I walked out of there feeling assured. I was extremely blunt and honest about withdrawals and using anxiety meds and I was not made to be ashamed of it.
I would even recommend ladies who were addicted against thier will to go there. I truly believe they would help you and make you not feel toxic. Which during my time in shelters ladies who were abused or not able to make good choices told me they assume about themselves.

They are kind, professional and always listen to what I have to share. They make my life liveable.|I have known Dr. Johnson for many years and he has always treated me with respect and dignity, unlike so many pain doctors.  He is always willing to listen, explain new medications, adjust doses: whatever it might take to bring me the most pain relief.  And he is honest with me when he discusses what level of pain relief I can expect, and works with me to get the best individualized plan that works for ME.  I was worried when Dr. Johnson began to turn some of my visits to Greg Wilkinson, a Physician Assistant.  But Mr. Wilkinson has come to know about my particular situation and has offered me wonderful care and spends time with me discussing various alternatives. Mr. Wilkinson, like Dr. Johnson, is always more concerned with my medical needs and comfort than he is with following some cookie-cutter protocol.  Mr. Wilkinson and Dr. Johnson allow me to continue to live life, work, visit family, all the things that my untreated pain had prevented - and I am eternally grateful to them both.

Then tried the proper address-267 E Park avenue.... It routed me to Park Avenue- no that's not it.....
Then it got all confused with Parks Highway and sent me back to Anchorage.
I finally called.... The Anchorage number.... Got sent to Wasilla- I finally called. After a while she finally picked up and said quickly ""Hold""- didn't ask if I could hold- just ""Hold"" click!
I held for 10 minutes, still holding I stopped the car and re entered the address- same problem  sent me to Anchorage, couldn't find E Park Avenue, sent me to Park then Parks Highway.  I turned around and looked at labels for key area buildings....
10 minutes on hold- She finally picked up the phone- I told her Google had me all over the place. Still looking. I'm going to be late.
I finally found the place... But it's labeled Valley Spine. I guess I'm here.... She said you're late and need to reschedule.... The phone rang in the middle of our discussion ""please hold ....Click "" then she rescheduled me for another date.

Dr. Cross is the ultimate and classy profession who sincerely takes her time with every patient and includes the patient on every step of the way. She is a supreme patient educator and patient advocate. Her team was so welcoming and they went above and beyond to reschedule after Alaska decided to throw a snow storm into the mix. To every member of the team, I give you my most heartfelt thank you!!!|The staff should have better bedside manner, family members go with their loved one to help and be with them, however twice now I feel talked down to and and treated like a random person when in fact I was there for my husband. I dread taking my husband to his appointments here. Have respect and do better with all people!|I went to Integrative Pain Center today for and intake/assessment, as my PCP issued a referral to them in November 2023. However, my initial appointment was scheduled for May 2024, but I cancelled due to recovering from a surgery and they quickly rescheduled it for August 29, 2024. My appointment lasted all of 10 minutes total. I found the lady working the front desk to be kind, but overly busy. I waited for almost 15 minutes or longer after my appointment ended for a medical release form but no one provided me with the form, so I left. Btw, the doctor claimed to need this form before she would treat me....a long with other background info which they had over nine months to request of me. A medical release document is something that should've been standard at my check-in or even given to me with their thick pre-intake package they emailed and needed returned before they would schedule. Instead this place would rather charge my insurance for unrendered services by having me arrive for an appointment that they wasn't prepared for. I plan to dispute the charges as beside going over my medications and looking at a CT scan from FMH they did not do anything. They must have some contact with FMH since apparently I didn't sign a release for them to see those records.

Also, it should be noted that I found the provider and the attending nurse to be prejudiced and lacking cultural sensitivity. Most importantly, they both of them lacked empathy and compassion, for many reasons that I'll gladly list out if asked. But I'll stress that I do not recommend this company or provider, Dr. Cross. I would've rated a zero or given it one star had it not been for the kind, but preoccupied, front desk clerk or office manager (I really don't know what her official title is). However, if you're of the BIPOC community, I highly suggest you seek out another provider even if you have to go to Anchorage or Seattle.|Dr. Cross is awesome. After getting the run around by many physicians over the years concerning my back pain, she was able to dial in and work out a pain management plan that has really improved my quality of life. Her entire team is super polite. Highly recommend!|Everytime I come back to Integrative Pain Centers to see Dr. Cross, I have a wonderful experience. The staff is very friendly and supporting and takes their time. I never feel rushed or as ""just an other patient"" - everybody makes me feel welcome and makes me feel like their priority for now. The Front Office stuff is friendly and professional and the MA's are helpful and understanding for my constant pain. Dr. Cross is always makes an effort to manage my pain in new ways and she listens and takes her time and she is very good in explaining everything that is going on. I never feel like I go into a procedure without knowing what is going to happen. She always makes an effort to educate her patients and to explain and answer every question. I finally found a doctor who can help me and make my pain tolerable.|Dr Cross is amazing.  This is the first time I have been pain free in over twenty years!|Dr ,  Cross should have her license removed!  I went to see her with my pain issues and I didn't know what was wrong so she looked at my mri and she said I was faking it then she sent my company a letter saying that I neededto return to work full duty and that there was nothing wrong with me. I had a real problem then so I went to a different Dr and it turned out my neck was completely crushed and broken in 4 places. She is the worst Dr I've ever met  definitely not recommended. She is crazy the way she flipped out on me in the Dr office. I was totally shocked.

They listen carefully and provide educated advice you can trust.  That has become lost in the medical money grab, but you do not get that absurd treatment from this office.
My primary pain doctor of over a decade retired and I was absolutely terrified trying to find another doctor who actually listened and was willing to try alternative methods, whatever it takes to get relief, without being medicated numb and regain some kind of semblance of a life.
My first appointment was outstanding!  The scheduling was quick and quite accommodating.  There was minimal wait time and this is not an exaggeration whatsoever!  They are thorough and professional yet provide a comfortable atmosphere where you feel confident in being able to share the intricacies of your unique situation.  They listen.

He relieved that pain many times with infusions that made life and normal movement bearable. After encouraging me to have an MRI, he discovered that I would need rather extensive surgery to permanently fix my pain problem. He continued with the infusions until I was able to schedule the surgery with an excellent neurosurgeon he suggested.  I have nothing but respect for Dr. Grissom's professionalism and medical expertise.  His office workers and assistants were consistently upbeat, welcoming, and of the highest caliber.  I would recommend Algone Clinic in general and Dr. Grissom in particular to any person with a pain issue.|After being with this clinic for over 4 years I have seen five different doctors. Eventually dr. Grissom decided to put a pain pump in me. After many trials we scheduled a surgical date at which time they put me under and brought me back two Consciousness telling me that their representative for the pain pump had not shown up. I asked them if they had known this before putting me under and they had told me yes but they thought that she would show up in the next 15 minutes. I asked them how late she was and she was supposed to be in at 8 in the morning and my appointment was at 1 p.m. . They decided to hold off the surgery due to me having a 10 x 7 inch hernia repaired that would have some recovery time. Directly after which doctor Grissom sent me three different letters terminating my contract with their pain management company. One said that I called too often which was impossible because I was still not able to use the phone at the hospital due to sedation. One letter was sent saying that I talked rudely to his team on a recording. I asked him if he could could hear that recording because I had known that I did not make any call like that and he hung up on me. The third letter stated that I had additional drugs in my system. At which point I asked him to see my clinical report and it clearly stated that the morphine in my system was from my hernia surgery. This doctor is self-involved and only worried about the promotion of his popularity through the medical field. He will step on any patient he can possibly gain influence from. I would not trust this doctor with my life or any of my children's lives.

Thank you for your exceptional care!""|First visit, consultation, was excellent. Catherine Lambert is very easy to talk to, inquisitive, caring and helpful. Among the best medical experiences I've had. Huge improvement from my previous pain management clinic. Recommended without reservation.|They asked for 5 star reviews that's the 1st red flag. They don't bill insurance and have you seek reimbursement after paying cash for your visits. I have not received one reimbursement. Finally and most notably they are judgmental and question you on your medication usage ( I've never failed one urine test and been taking pain meds for 13 years). They don't know how to take clinical notes and when you get frustrated with the whole process they discharge you from their clinic and state that YOU are the problem. The worst experience in all the years of going to different clinics to manage my pain. Deborah ( operations manager)  & Dr. Tamara McDonald are the absolute worst in the whole Valley!! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Don't believe any response they try and post in response to this review cause I'm sure their egos will get hurt by this review!|This office is absolutely amazing. The front desk staff are so sweet and delightful. The nurses are so kind and my NP Tammy McDonald is great! She takes her time with you and is so sweet. I couldn't recommend this office more!|I recently had my consultation with NP Tammy McDonald after moving from the east coast out here to Yuma, AZ.  I had difficulty finding a new pain doctor because there is only one clinic in Yuma and that provider has a 4 month wait list.  So on a whim I called AZ Pain Medicine and the receptionist, Deborah, was so nice and helpful and told me she could get me in the next week.  I took the appointment and I'm so happy that I did!

The drive was 3 hours to Phoenix but I think it was totally worth it, because there is nothing that compares to peace of mind when you're a chronic pain patient.  It's scary to have to find a new provider, especially after the stress of moving across the country.   Everyone was very friendly and efficient at the clinic and I could tell right away that it would be a good experience.  Deborah sent me the patient paperwork prior to my appointment so I came with all of it filled out. My wait time wasn't very long at all.

NP Tammy McDonald was my provider and she was so kind and really took a lot of time inquiring about my  history with my pain condition.  I appreciate when a provider takes the time to get to know you and really listen to how pain has affected your life. And the best part is that she was understanding and listened to me! I have had a couple of experiences years ago when I was seen by providers who literally spent less than 5 minutes with me and didn't seem to care at all or take my pain seriously.  That was not the case this time! And I'm so grateful for that! It's so difficult as a pain patient when providers don't listen and want to come in and immediately start making changes before even asking how you feel!!! But this was not the case this time.  I felt so relieved to see that I had found a provider who I knew genuinely cared and wanted to help me.  She even suggested another medication that might help me if I wanted to try it in the future.  So I could see that she genuinely cared about my quality of life and pain level.

Peace of mind and having an empathetic provider is what I look for in a pain clinic and I believe I have found that with AZ Pain Medicine.  I don't mind the drive nor do I mind paying out of pocket because I feel it's worth it when it comes to having a top notch provider.  Chronic pain is exhausting sometimes and it makes it even worse when you feel like you aren't believed or taken seriously by providers.... I've been a pain patient for 7 years so I've seen some great providers and a couple of less empathetic ones. Well,  NP Tammy McDonald is one of the best and I highly  recommend AZ Pain Medicine to anyone who is trying to find a provider!|Today my RX was delayed at 4pm by Walgreens needing a pre authorization from my new insurance. Knowing az pain med closes at 4 they still answered and had it all taken care of within 30 minutes. The level of care a patient receives in this office is 10star. They really care and understand what can happen with a delayed prescription. They were fast, kind and followed up at the end to let me know what was happening. I appreciate being treated like I mattered. Thank you|AZ Pain Medicine Clinic lied TWICE so far.  I am supposed to have my ablation done tomorrow, and they call me 24 hours before the procedure to tell me the insurance denied it saying that it is experimental. So they need to change it to an epidural steroid injection into my lower back. I asked why I'm finding out 24 hours before my procedure instead of weeks ago when it was ordered. I called my insurance. They denied it because they did not send over any physicians notes with the request so that is why insurance denied it. The first lie came with scheduling the procedure that my insurance would only cover the procedure on Tuesdays, Thursdays or Fridays, as I wanted sedation for this and would need a driver but they are only available on Mondays. Again called insurance and they have no stipulation on coverage days, it's the office that codes different days a different way.  They lie, they don't help. I will be researching new pain management. Don't trust what they say and always ask questions, confirm with your insurance.|Great practice for those with pain.  I've been a patient for many years!!!

The doctor and staff are not only compassionate but also highly effective in their care. They truly listen, which is reflected in the dedication of the team, many of whom have been there for as long as I can remember. Given the typically high turnover in front desk and medical assistant roles, it is remarkable to see a team that remains consistent, always welcoming, and genuinely happy to help.

From check in to my consultation with the medical assistant, my visit with the nurse practitioner, and ultimately my procedure with the doctor, every step of the experience is exceptional. The staff is attentive, detail oriented, professional, and inviting. Their commitment to superior patient care is evident in every interaction.

I wholeheartedly recommend this practice to anyone in need of pain management. They truly make a difference.

The care we have received the time spent listening to our concerns about treatment have been better than we could ask for. Dr Ormond is knowledgeable compitant and compassionate. I highly recommend him to address your pain and health needs. And again. His staff All of them are wonderful|Yesterday I was treated at Atlas Pain Specialists for my extreme sciatic pain. Transportation to Atlas required transport via gurney arranged with Royal Express (Eric). With his professional service, I arrived comfortably with no problems.
When I arrived on the gurney I was immediately met with the ladies at the front desk and those involved in my treatment process.  They showed so much care and compassion to make this process as seamless and positive as possible.  I experienced smiles, positivity and compassion and genuine care from all of the employees.  Dr. Ormand was great and the treatment was quick, professional and my special needs were a top priority.
Those at Atlas Pain and Royal Express truly care about their clients and take extra care and compassion in dealing with your specific needs. That is a rare experience in the medical service these days. I absolutely highly recommend entrusting your medical care with the staff at Atlas Pain Specialists. They truly care about their patients!|A routine appointment today. The clinical staff of Dr. Ormmond anre  always pleasant and interested in your health problem resolution. They  do not rush you and take their time in answering all your. Questions. I highly compliment  his staff for their professionalism. If you need a pain management group this is the place to go!|Easy recommendation for a very difficult practice area. Dr. Ormond is kind, intelligent, and great doctor. Happy to have his assistance. Staff is also wonderful. Five stars|The best pain management facility I have ever been to. I work in healthcare and I'm a cancer survivor that ended up with some issues after my cancer treatments. I was in so much pain and didn't have a lot of hope for anything better. Many pain management clinics didn't even treat me like a human - and didn't offer many alternatives to alleviate the pain from the arthritis and autoimmune disease that came about after breast Cancer. I can honestly say Dr. Ormond gave me my life back. We are still working through things but man I feel a marked improvement with his treatment plans. They are on the forefront of many pain methodologies that have greatly improved my quality of life. If you just want meds thrown at you, this isn't the place for you. What Dr. Ormond does is treat your pain with proper methods with the goal to taper off or significantly lower your medication usage. This was super important to me.

Thank you Atlas Pain. Thank you for treating me so respectfully and being attentive at all my appointments. Thank you for putting me at ease during procedures, and thank you for treating me like a person. This place quite literally saved my life. I was in so much pain prior to seeing Dr. Ormond and in just 4 months I already feel like a totally different person.  I highly recommend you give Atlas Pain and a try.|Love the front desk people. They are business oriented, but still have their humanity intact. I prefer seeing Dr Ormand, as I have had back pain for 20yrs. Highly recommend.|Super offended with the PA.

No bed side manner now just trying to find an excuse for my discharge for a previous error on my behalf even though all my urinalysis came back clean. Not interested in a practice like this. I won't even complete my remaining procedures with them.

The doctors at this clinic are far superior to any I have ever dealt with. They care!They are personable, knowledgeable, And take all the time needed to listen to your problems and help you in anyway they can to control the pain you're having. I was told by my doctor in Canada there was nothing they could do to help me with the chronic pain I was having. I reached out to Mayo Clinic and was referred by them to the Saguaro Pain clinic. They truly have given me a second chance at a life With less pain. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.
God bless you For all that, you do to make a difference in so many lives|Excellent service from Saguaro. I contacted Saguaro due to having 5-7 cluster headaches per day. Very painful and also known as ""suicide headaches"". Dr. Derian thoroughly questioned and considered my symptoms, and recommended a new course of prescription medicine. My headaches have vanished and I'm using a medicine to help prevent them from coming back. My experience with the staff was just as good, especially with the RN Ashley. Ashley made sure my pharmacy filled the new prescriptions and was always available when I needed some assistance. I highly recommend Saguaro if you have a need for some type of pain relief. Best of all, they actually care about you!|Dr Dabbah is the fantastic, he takes the time with me and I do not feel rushed during my appointment.  I always walk out of the office feeling better.  His staff is very helpful and friendly.  I definitely recommend Saguaro Pain clinic!|We highly highly recommend Saguaro Pain Clinic!!! My sons experience has been exceptional!! Referral was sent to them Friday morning, by Friday afternoon they called and my son had an appointment set for the following Monday. We went in Monday, appointment was on time. They had him setup for his injection for that next Friday. The communication from the first phone call to the follow up telehealth appointment has been amazing. Thank you for taking care of us and having such excellent communication!!|I was in a car accident and have been to both the Warner and Ellsworth locations. I am so pleased with the services from beginning to end. I was always welcomed with a smile and they remembered me on being hearing impaired. They are very caring, professional and took their time to get me through the injections on my back.

The first was negative because of a bizarre interaction with Gianni. But, overall, this office is terrific. Dr Seth has helped me thru a difficult time with kindness and support. He is an excellent MD. I trust him and know he will always help me find the best way to manage my situation. The staff are great, too. Friendly and professional, but not uptight. Lately, seeing a NP/PA has been a bit of a challenge. There has been a lot of turnover so it's difficult to build rapport. I think that caused my issue with Gianni today. We don't know each other, I saw a different provider last month, a third provider 2 months ago and a 4th earlier in the year. I think consistency in pain management is critical. There seem to be many changes since a big company bought out the practice. When there have been issues or concerns, I've been told that they can't do anything about it, the company that owns the practice has dictated the way things are being done. I still give the practice 5 stars because of Dr Seth and his long time staff. They are outstanding.

Most people wait until they are desperate to address their pain and at that point, they need strong medication to get their pain under control just to be able to sleep or make it through the day. This doesn't address the root of the pain and can become a vicious cycle.

Nevertheless, I was informed that the new clinic would not send my prescription to the pharmacy until they received a release, thus delaying the start of my pain medication.These clinics are now more concerned with what their lawyers say then what their patients legitimately need for treatment.

I have been prescribed opiods dozens of times since I first experienced severe back pain in my teens, and I have never abused them in over 40 years. After my recent hospitalization, I reduced my meds consumption to 25% of what it had been with no assistance from any pain clinic.

Thank you, Dr. K|So grateful for Dr. Kuppusamy and his team!! I had a pinched nerve in my back causing very painful sciatica pain. Had an injection done and my pain has completely disappeared.

He educated me and I felt confident in choosing him for the epidermal into my spine for my nerve pain. This is why the second star.  This is my second epidural for my neck and the first one was successfully completed by another facility in Scottsdale.  Fast forward.... Every visit with this Gilbert location and they request your insurance card, credit card and all the same intake questions for every single visit by email and when u arrive onsite.  (Super broken and annoying process). Post procedure and the pain level increased 5 times.  Afterwards I felt like something was trying to explode off my neck and upper back.  I was told this is normal and to give it time.  Well I am 4 weeks post procedure and feel zero improvement to my pain.  I scheduled an appointment to see the doctor and was told that he doesn't do follow ups.  I have to see the PA and she will communicate with the doctor.  About 1.5 years ago I had this same procedure at a location in scottsdale and it was nothing like this.  I had relief and the doctor saw me post procedure.  I should have driven the extra 30 minutes to go back there instead of trying out The pain Experts and having a very poor experience.  I will update my review based on the appointment w the PA.  Let's see if they correct what has not worked.  At this point I would absolutely not recommend this facility|Dr. Kuppusamy at The Pain Experts of Arizona provided exceptional care.

During my appointments, I felt that the level of professionalism displayed was lacking. Specifically, I found the communication to be dismissive and lacking in empathy. I was referred to your clinic by my primary doctor for issues related to my neck and the left side of my body, including my left arm and shoulder, which are directly associated with a recent car accident car (my vehicle was on shop for 4 weeks ). However, during our consultation, I was surprised and disappointed to receive a diagnosis of arthritis, with the explanation that my age (nearly 40) is the likely cause.

I believe that attributing my symptoms solely to age, without considering the context of my recent accident, was both unprofessional and inappropriate. It felt as though my concerns and the specifics of my situation were not adequately acknowledged. This left me feeling frustrated and confused, as I expected a more nuanced understanding of my condition, especially given the circumstances.

I am reaching out to you because I believe it is crucial for your clinic to be aware of this experience. I hope that you can address this matter to improve the level of care and communication provided to your patients.

Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your prompt response regarding how you intend to address my concerns.

Sincerely,

Hilse Vera",2025-01-27|2025-01-28|2025-02-03|2025-01-27|2024-12-31|2024-10-20|2024-09-12|2024-12-10,5|5|5|5|1|3|5|1,,,"9 a.m.|10 a.m.|8 a.m.",78.6|77.6|74.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|friendly_staff|good_doctors|board_certified_physicians|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|convenient_clinic_location|thorough_care|short_wait_times|comfortable_waiting_area|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|on_site_pharmacy|telemedicine_available|open_7_days_a_week|extended_hours|emergency_appointments|flexible_payment_options|cash_credit_payments_accepted|multilingual_staff_available,,,,,,,,,,ChIJTZ30R0hoK4cRlQXaFmbfJGI,676

I was able to stop receiving NSAID+steroid injections every couple of months to deal with the pain & inflammation because of electro-equiscope. I've had sessions with all of their PT's and they're all incredibly well trained and attentive to what your body is needing. Find a PT that aligns with you, what you feel works the best for your body and stick with them. I use Destina and she is incredible. (This is a massive understatement about Destina.) Over time, she's only become more in tuned with my fluctuations and inflammation. I cannot go more than a week without her amazing handiwork! Mike in the front office is always on top of everything, ensuring my appointments stay scheduled out and I always stay on Destina's schedule.

I had an unfortunate experience with my ablation procedure on September 20, 2024, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts. While the staff was quick to attend to me, I felt the overall approach to patient care was severely lacking.

During my visit, I was brought back by a medical assistant who informed me of the procedure's name. After a brief discussion about my medical history with the anesthesiologist, I was put under anesthesia. When I woke up, I found myself sitting in a wheelchair in another room with very little monitoring. I was only observed for about 10 minutes before being sent out to my car while still feeling dazed and out of it.

What was particularly disheartening was that the doctor who performed my procedure never introduced themselves or discussed what I could expect during or after the procedure. I felt like just another name on a schedule, not a patient deserving of individualized attention. As someone who works in the medical field, I understand that these procedures are routine for medical professionals, but this was my first experience. I felt incredibly vulnerable when I woke up disoriented and without any information about what had transpired.

I am extremely disappointed in the patient care I received and am now apprehensive about future procedures. I hope that Advanced Pain Management can take this feedback seriously and work towards transforming their approach to offer more personalized care. Patients deserve to feel valued and cared for, not like they are just part of an assembly line.|Johnson Wong has consistently listened to my needs, curated a treatment plan, and been prompt in communications. Even with several SNAFUs with insurance and other doctors, he has provided the relief of my pain anxieties and my bizarre circumstances. I would say go to him, but i don't want him getting so crowded I can't be his patient.|Ever since I was a little kid, I was terrified of needles . I was the kid who would always say, ""ok..wait wait wait ok I'm ready...no wait wait wait wait a minute."" Now being an elderly adult you can best believe that now I'm going to be brave and say, wait wait wait wait wait a minute..some things just don't change, however, Dr Wong has the most amazing personality and patience for an elderly kid like me. I love coming to the Glendale clinic because the staff are phenomenal and Dr Wong is extremely supportive and knowledgeable about my various autoimmune diseases and he has the Midas touch when this scary elderly adult gets the trigger shots done. Dr Wong has a very strong understanding the unique needs of each of many pain scenarios that I live with. Some may wonder why I don't get a more aggressive treatment plan. Well unfortunately, I can't be sedated even lightly due to Hypoxia (COPD, and many other chronic conditions) so I depend on the extra calming attention. Thanks again for all your help. J.

I was running late for something very important and had to leave before I signed some paperwork. front desk understood and was nice about it.|As always the care and service is amazing. All of the staff from the front desk to the nursing and radiology staff to Dr. Duran is top notch.  They make you feel comfortable and cared for. Being a patient here has improved my quality of life. Highly recommend!|My nurse practitioner is always friendly and helpful. I have chronic pain in my sacroiliac joints with nothing working so far but she never gives up. She's always looking up other things that she can try. The rest of the staff is great also!|From my 1st appointment until my post op I was treated with so much respect. My friend who took me for my procedure remarked that he thought it was a top notch facility. I told him that I was told the procedure would take about 45 minutes and he was doubtful. At the 45 minute mark we were getting into the car to leave. Dr Duran and staff are amazing!|First time I've interacted with Lindsay and it was a very pleasant experience. She listened to me and I felt heard. My doctor was trying to lower my meds, two months in a row, and I protested a little, and she went to bat for me and got me extended for another month because of the amount of pain I've been in. I appreciate her help so much!|Super unprofessional, you go to your appointment and are told the dr. Is not in she called in. When you ask what are you supposed to do they will say ""I don't know"" what are you supposed to do without your medication? Running out of your medication can put you in dangerous withdrawal. They don't care. Then they tell you "" you are going to need to get a new referral to be seen, your referral ran out"" why was I not informed about it on my last appointment or when you call to confirm the appointment? You get punished if you are late more than 10 to 15 min but they can have you drive across the city so you can hear the Dr. Called in. Why couldn't you guys call the person and tell them not to come in? Some of the staff is super nice but then you get someone like the one girl  today, that doesn't care at all. On your 1st appointment they will let you see the actual dr. They are nice and they care but after that they will stick you with the NP or PA that has an attitude and always trying to change your treatment. If it works leave it alone.

Initially, the office manager seemed supportive, but her attitude changed after speaking with the doctor. Her response to my situation was dismissive, merely stating that the staff offered another appointment time. That doesn't address the real issue.

I knew it.... Alex is wonderful, she truly listens to me when I talk and she gives my experiences and my observations about myself, thoughtful consideration..
As I suspected after our first meeting, she's a gifted, outstanding provider.
I've never gotten the impression that she was running behind and had to rush through our appointment to get to her next patient.
I believe she's truly committed to my wellbeing and she's properly educated and determined enough to make it happen. I'm having frequent appointments while we're getting procedures, treatments, and medication straightened out.
I've made substantial improvements in my day to day abilities and the quality of my life.  I'm very hopeful that my progress will continue.
I haven't been this hopeful for so many years.
If you like numbers the way that I like numbers, I'll give you mine now. I'd say I'm at 30/30. Overall, my day-to-day abilities have increased by at least 30% and my pain has decreased at least 30%. If you have severe chronic pain like I do, you'll understand the significance of those numbers.
The office runs like a top, they are very efficient and they don't waste my time.
With that said, if you make an appointment... Don't be late, I've been told that they do not see patients who are late.
That's the only way to keep an office running like a top.

Original review:
Just finished my first appointment and so far so good.
I feel very hopeful with Alexandra as my provider. We've already scheduled a procedure and some different medications and am awaiting the scheduling of physical therapy. I'll be updating my review as my nightmarish pain is relieved  and I get a bit of my life  back. I'm looking forward to earning decent  money again!

The office staff is actually pleasant and friendly! Every time I call they are always pleasant and helpful. Dr. Elizabeth is attentive and knowledgeable and so helpful and yes she's pleasant as well!! The chiropractor is wonderful!! Dr. Schirck has a different technique that has me moving better and relived some pain. I haven't been able to say that in years!!! I highly recommend this office!!!|Dr. Schirck, the chiropractor at this clinic has been amazing! Very willing to listen and work with you and learn new things that may help. I only have positive things to say about their doctors and surgeons as well.  I highly recommend Arizona Pain!|I have been coming to Arizona pain in Glendale for about 4 months. I am so grateful I found Dr Schirck. He's amazing. He takes his time and listens to how I feel. You can tell, he and the entire staff,  really cares. I definitely recommend Arizona pain, Dr. Elizabeth and Dr. Schirck|I have been coming here for over 15 years and they have always treated me with respect and kindness. Everyone here, starting with the registration desk to the doctors have always listened to my issues and not treated me like I don't know what I'm talking about. They do an amazing job of treating my pain without making me feel like a drug addict as well! The docs that do the injections to help my pain have always been so kind as well! They make me feel comfortable in all they do!|While the receptionist and one of the nurses is really kind, the the doctors are liars, they lie to your face having surgery is NOT recommended. I had a surgery and I have been in an extreme amount of pain ever since I can not turn the battery on without an extreme amount of pain. They cut into me while I was still awake, and they refused to fix anything that they've done. So do I recommend this place absolutely 100% NOT!!! Find a place that actually cares about the pain you are in, I recommend Barrows!|This is not for the office or Dr but for the woman who answered the phone when I called back to make the 1st appt. She was rude. She didn't listen to what I was telling her. When I said I wanted early or mid afternoon, she heard morning and denied I had told her afternoon. When I explained I only could get there 2 days a week, she told me appt avail for wrong day. She knew it all and I was just ignorant is how I felt she treated me. I wasn't important enough to get the appt done right. My email is complicated. It's words together but they aren't spelled normal. I tried to tell her it then said I would spell it as most people don't spell it right. I spoke email but B4 trying to spell it, she assumed it spelled her way and was fussy about letting me spell it for her. She just wanted to get on with next phone call like she either gets bonus for each one or has a quota. She didn't want to listen to me so she just pushed past my questions and answers to hers. I've been to many DR offices and generally they are pretty nice. I'd give her a 2 only for allegedly getting info right but this looks like neg will go against the Dr office and not the call center. I haven't seen Dr yet. I just want them to know the woman answering the phone would be better off in a job not speaking to patients who want answers and not just bullied into doing it as fast as possible so she can call next patient. May the Lord Bless her.|Wow what a different! we talked though lots of different options I've never had that before with my other pain management. I felt very comfortable with AZ pain and like I fell I am on the way to getting my problems resolved, and back to a normal life!|Horrible mixed review --- Earlier in 2023 a nerve block, which had to be validated elsewhere, and then later on thru 2024, very poor back office as they lost my files and stated everything ""was covered"", which was incorrect, as my insurance had sent them  [and me] two different letters of denial, including appeal, so that is a huge issue.  Only reason for the 3 stars is back in early 2023 they at least tried to help even though sub-optimal delivery, and responses.  I observed  significant turnover [surgeon and initial intake person switched at last minute] with poor training and processes [We did not mean to lose your files and would you like to schedule a new appointment...? ]  If every hour for you is pain, you should consider other providers.

What would you do?You can't park anywhere because of all of the other business when it's busy. My pain is worse.|I would not recommend this clinic for numerous reasons. First, their office is open to the waiting room and you can hear everything that is being said on the phone because they use phones and not headsets. So anything you say on the phone is going to be heard by everyone in the waiting room. Second, the front desk clerk seems to have no idea about dealing with insurance companies in orders. Third, the nurse practitioner couldn't even take my blood pressure with a regular cough. She didn't know what she was doing. Plus, she took me off of a medication that my primary doc said was no problem to use as long as you didn't use too much at a time. That medicine was important to me. My overall experience is that I am not going back to this location again|I made an appointment with Dr. Patel through his staff and was given the first available time which was almost immediately.  My lower back was excruciatingly in pain.  I could not walk upright or sit without being in pain. From 1 to 10, my pain was 10!!  Dr. Patel was very compassionate and prescribed some pain medicine for me over the weekend and was lined up for a MRI the following week.  Dr. Patel mapped out a plan for getting me well after he could view the MRI results.  Over the weekend, the pain in my back dramatically decreased with the use of the pain medicine.  On Monday, I canceled my MRI and all of my future appointments because my pain had decreased so much that I knew that I could heal on my own.  I did have a follow up Face Time with one of the Nurses at the pain center because they are truly concerned with each. patient.  If I am ever in pain again, I will make another appointment and do recommend to anyone that who is having back pain to contact Arizona Pain Care Center.  They are there to help you and do understand your pain!

Jim Flemming|I do not recommend this clinic. After being put on oxycodone I was informed I could never have another drink again. I have had back pain for 15 to 20 years I used kratom and alcohol to stop the pain. I told them what I was doing day 1.
They put me on oxycodone. It helped 100 %. I was told I could never have another drink and never have take kratom. I tried to explain that getting off kratom might take awhile. They seemed to understand.
I never used alcohol very much. They told me taking kratom and alcohol could make me depressed. Instead of working with me they refused to renew my prescription they immediately took me off. I tried to explain it might take awhile to stop kratom and I thought stating a I could never have another drink seemed a little harsh. But there was no explaining anything to them.
There was no weening myself of the oxycodone, kratom or alcohol.
I do not recommend this clinic. Try another place that might listen to you.
Also if I smoked weed (which I do not) that would have been fine. I took no illegal drugs. They made a lot of money from the insurance company so I guess it worked out for them.|My experience with AZ pain care center has been better than other pain mgmt practices. My provider is Shannon.

One gripe.
One assistant called me sweetie, then the next one called me dear. While I understand they meant no insult,  it is about time staff understood that terms of ""affection"" in medical offices are inappropriate.
I  am not a child nor am I demented 90 year old. I am a capable, intelligent, vigorous 71 year old woman. Such terms are belittling and rude. Would these women call Dr Grove sweetie or dear? No. Use my first name or ask me what I want to be called and then use my name.

Thank you APM for always listening to  me ranting and still being so kind!!!!!!|I got dc for asking a question to the person who answers the phone. 7 yrs I've known them. Epidurals are not FDA approved and what is going on. They kicked me out for asking a question. Difference between aggressive and assertive and being intelligent. I have lupus and I'm an amputee. Will be reporting for PT abuse immediately. U cannot show any emotion either states a contract. I asked a valid question. My pt rights were violated. Ty for nothing. Those epidurals Illegal in other countries. I didn't even know I was kicked out of the office until I called to ask about a nerve block. I guess I'm not allowed to be intelligent. Absolute patient abuse and never again is anybody going to abuse me medically. I know my rights. A little too well. I feel like the lower part of my back is fused that shouldn't be. And I can barely pick up the good leg that I do have left because I'm an amputee Jerry was always amazing with me and then Dr gee took over and he never listened to me he never wanted to. So now I'm looking into palliative care because it's so bad and I'm getting an advocate. I was left with one month of prescriptions and no referral for continuity of care. They said that I was going to the supreme Court and I don't know anybody at the supreme Court but a lady by the native of Claudia morandi she is an advocate for pain patients and she is the one who is advocating for us not me but now she she has certainly heard my story. I am very heartbroken because I was with Jerry for about 7 years after I became an amputee and he helped me immediately and once Dr g got his hands in the mix everything was messed up and now I have no quality of life and I'm going down fast. This will also go in my article for the American psychology association because once you are done with my spine you knew that you wouldn't be making any more money off me be informing my insurance company as well. Ask questions please. I will never be the same again.

And now I will be taking legal action|right off 101/ Ray rd. Dr g is one smart guy, attentive, and listens . he, his pa, np's truly want the best for us.
thanks to all ya for r tolerating me!|I had my first appointment at Advanced Pain Modalities last month and was extremely impressed with Dr. Gollapalli.
He put me at ease with his kind and personable demeanor as soon as I met him.
Dr. Gollapalli was kind, empathetic, intelligent, and highly knowledgeable.
He understood my autioimmune conditon well, which causes chronic pain as well as other symptoms.
I was also a former patient of Gerard Quigley at my previous pain specialist office. He is now a practitioner at APM.  He was always empathetic, intelligent, and highly knowledgeable as well.
Mirabelle is a very helpful, kind, and professional front office medical assistant.
I would highly recommend Advanced Pain Modalities to anyone looking for a pain specialist clinic.|Dr. G and Gerard are 2 of the most amazing health providers I have ever had.  I am always spoken to with dignity and respect.  They look for solutions to the pain not just a band aid!|Dr. Gallipoli is amazing. Listens to YOU and hears YOU!  Gerard also in his office is great. They work to HELP you not just give a band aid|I have been blessed to be a patient of Dr. G's for several years.  He is truly one of the most caring and compassionate doctors I have ever met.  He is extremely knowledgeable and takes excellent care of me.  I had a life changing traumatic accident in 2008 which has left me disabled and in chronic pain.  (I fell over 8 feet and broke my thoracic spine in 7 places, broke apart my tailbone, suffered other injuries and also battle with chronic neuropathic pain throughout my body).  Through Dr. G's expertise and phenomenal care, he has improved my quality of life.  I cannot thank him enough for ALL he has done for me and continues to do for me.  I highly recommend Dr. G to anyone who suffers with complex pain issues and disorders.

Their commitment to punctuality is impressive, with appointments starting on time 95% of the time. The office staff deserves a shoutout for their courteous, efficient, and accommodating nature.

Asked to speak to the practice manager as for the 3rd time the wrong procedure was scheduled and needed to express my sincere concerns, was placed on hold for over 5 minutes. So called back and was informed that the manager is not in the office until Wednesday of the following weeks, today is Friday, quite a long hold time!

Dr Thakkar is most excellent, fully explains procedure and any and all information asked, his staff's charting is sorely lacking. The patient is my mother who is disabled from a stroke. If I was not there to advocate for her I shutter to think of what medical outcome she would have had.

Anyone seeking the excellent care of Dr Thakkar, make sure that all information is correct, what is being treated, the side, the procedure notated by staff. As I am finishing this review, I received a call from the practice saying that the procedure (an ablation) originally schedule that was incorrectly scheduled as a nerve block on the opposite side of body has now been corrected.

He has gone over my images with me and talked through my options for care moving forward. He takes the time to listen and seems like he truly cares about his patients. The office is very nice as well.|This location is clean, staff is very nice and welcoming! Came and did cryotherapy(1st time here), best experience so far! Any questions I had staff answered and I didn't feel pressure to buy anything. Staff was super helpful when booking appointments. The systems here are very modern and work great! I recommend checking if they have any packages on groupon (great savings). Other than that prices are fair for the experience you get here!

(If you found this helpful be sure to hit the thumbs up button.)

Update: I've been here 5 times now , and still love it here. Got a completely different staff and they still were so sweet and helpful.|Dr. Haddad & her staff deserve at least 5 stars.  Very caring office that is working hard to find ways to fix my pain.  She is leaving no stone unturned.  Never makes you feel rushed, takes the time to explain things which may require doing it more than once because sometimes it takes a while till I grasp things.
If you need pain management, she's a great find!|I would have given this medical group a 5-star.  The staff was great and the doctor visit was great.  He listened to my concerns, was knowledgeable, and explained the options depending on my MRI results.  Part of my decision to go to this practice instead of another was that it wouldn't take very long to get an appointment and others were booked way out.

So here is were the 1 Star comes in!  I was not told that the doctor I was seeing was only temporary.  Also, I expected a call from eSMIL to schedule my MRI within a day or two of my appointment, which has been typical of other doctors I go to.

I waited a week for the order to come through.  No call, so I called the office.  They simply said that he hadn't sent in the MRI order yet, and that he would.  I ended up calling back at least another couple of times...I think more.  I didn't keep track.  It is now a month and a half after my appointment, and still no MRI order which the doctor agreed was necessary.

I called today, and now they tell me that he is no longer practicing there.  This is when they told me he was only temporary.  I told them I had called several times.  If he was only temporary, why didn't they tell me that and set me up with another doctor?

She said that they had other transitions in staff...not just the doctor I was seeing.

So basically they likely didn't follow up with other patients as well as myself.  I'm sure they have many patients who have had similar experiences, though I can't be sure of course.

What it comes down to is...Someone should have been immediately assigned to me, and I should have been contacted about the change and not told each time that he just hadn't gotten to ordering the MRI yet.  Some other Dr. should have called in the order, and I should have been informed and asked if I wanted to accept an alternate doctor.|Dr. Overdorf performed the Intracept procedure on 3 vertebrae that have caused me pain for years. The relief I felt after six weeks was significant. I would recommend anyone suffering with back pain consider Intracept as a possible solution.",2024-12-24|2025-02-11|2024-09-10|2024-07-08|2019-04-29|2024-08-18|2024-04-29|2024-09-17,5|5|5|5|5|5|1|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJk7n3ypl2K4cRX06vc_4tiqU,83

To connect me with all the proper people for any part of their organization I needed to have a smooth experience.. Fantastic.. You must try these folks.. you will not regret it ...!    I wish I could give them 10 STARS|On the organizational side, all of the staff have been polite courteous and professional. Unless there're hit with the unexpected, appointments are on time as scheduled. The procedure Prep. group are very efficient and personable, more than willing to assist the patient, whatever their requests.
My needs were successfully diagnosed and treated by Dr. David Morales and his team. Being anesthetized most of the time, I can't speak for there're actual hands on skills ,but the results to date have been a major relief from relentless pain.
In follow up visits with Dr. Morales, he has demonstrated compassion and commitment to the patient for a pain free life.

They were the most reasonable about what they force people to sign.  There was by far the LEAST shenanigans getting the bill to the insurance.  They didn't falsify the records on me like Goodyear Chiropractic did.  I hate basically the entire healthcare profession for being a giant money sucking racket, and experience has borne that out, but at least this place was good in so far as I got the service I expected, didn't (as far as I know today) get screwed, and overall no bad surprises, which I've come to expect.|Excellent service through out my whole time being a patient with them, the front desk girls are very polite and always made me feel welcomed and greeted me with a smile.

I love the fact that appointments are via video. Due to my disability, I have a lot of doctor appointments, and getting to do one I have scheduled regularly via video makes things so much easier for me! Also, OnCall knows what they are doing and they are great at it. If I run into problems at the pharmacy or insurance, OnCall is right on top of it and they get things straightened out so quickly. My provider, Leah, is AWESOME!! She is so nice and she cares about the fine details. Caring about the fine details now helps to prevent issues later (I often have issues with the pharmacy and her attention to detail has helped so much). I will be with OnCall for a very long time!!!|Extremely happy to have found this office. They listen, understand patients, and actually care about their patients health. My provider has been so helpful in getting me a regimen to control my chronic pain and all the medical assistance are responsive and attentive. Love On Call Pain clinic, can't go wrong with trusting them with your chronic pain.|I have been with OnCall Pain since they went virtual. They are very compassionate about you the patient. I was able to get a MRI, bone density test, nerve study, ortho brace, surgery consult so many different special referrals in the last 2 years the doctors really care about you and your pain. When I first started OnCall Pain I was on a walker and had very little activity.  Now I am active again because OnCall Pain helps me manage the pain. They taught me new ways to manage my pain, sometimes just tying new things each month.|I have been with OnCall Pain for two years now!  I have been able to return to a normal everyday productive life with all their help!  The best experience with Pain Management I've had since having to be in this type of care!  Five star experience with providers and staff! Thank you for all you do OnCall!!
Happy Holidays!!|So glad I found this clinic! Ashley took the time get to know me as a person and addressed all my issues in a very empathic and professional way. I've had two compression fractures in my spine, arthritis and bone spurs and a myriad of other things that cause chronic pain. I've been receiving interventional treatments from another pain management clinic such as nerve blocks and RFA treatments. They were still not able to control my pain although I highly recommend the ablation since it did provide some relief, but since I was honest about being a sober alcoholic for the last 2.5 years they dismissed any other valid pain medication options for me. I had tried multiple non narcotic medications, physical therapy and massage and chiropractic work with them but I was still at the end of my rope. On call pain is very serious about the management of opioid therapy therapeutically and I am so grateful to them for seeing me as a person and not a label like a lot of pain management doctors out there. I can actually do housework without having to be in bed flat on my back afterwards. I can't say enough good things about this clinic. Thank you again!|They are so good. They actually treat you as a human being, listen to your unique circumstances, diseases, etc.
Make a plan that is built for you and with you. There are no hidden agendas or medications that they are trying to have you take for their own reasons. I feel that they actually care about my quality of life and that I am not just a number.
I had a local person for over a year, and all she did was decide that every person really just had fibromyalgia and needed to take ever-increasing doses of Lyrica, which in my case caused a great deal of damage to my already damaged joints.
I have been with OnCall for over 4 years now. They were and are my miracle. I spend at least a thousand dollars a month on interventional pain procedures, not just medications. That's what so many pharmacists don't know or care about. They just think they are going to save the world and those of us who NEED help are the ones creating the problems, in their minds.

I understand for my circumstances that I will never be pain free and don't expect to be. But I think we all deserve to have some quality of life. And they have given me that!|I have been a CPP for 25 years and am so blessed to have found care at OnCall Pain. I am able to receive compassionate care from the comfort of my home without judgement. I have complex needs and appreciate that my provider treats me like a human being, always providing new ideas for things to try outside of just medications which I appreciate!|This is my In-Depth Review of OnCall Pain Management

I have had an exceptional experience with OnCall Pain Management's online service, and I feel compelled to share my positive experience.

Their Thoughtful and Responsible Approach
What truly sets OnCall Pain Management apart is their thoughtful and responsible approach to pain management. From the very first consultation, it was evident that their priority was not just to provide relief, but to genuinely understand the nature of my pain. Their team took the time to listen, ask pertinent questions, and create a tailored pain management plan that addressed my specific needs. This personalized care made me feel valued and heard, which is something I haven't always experienced with traditional medical services.

The Convenience of Online Consultations
The convenience of online consultations cannot be overstated. In today's fast-paced world, being able to access high-quality medical advice and pain management from the comfort of my home has been a game-changer. The process is seamless, from scheduling appointments to receiving prescriptions and follow-up care. The platform is user-friendly, ensuring that even those who are not tech-savvy can navigate it with ease. The flexibility of online consultations has eliminated the stress and inconvenience of traveling to appointments, especially during times when I'm in significant pain.

The Accessibility without Compromise
One of the standout features of OnCall Pain Management is their ability to maintain a high standard of care without compromising accessibility. The online nature of their service ensures that individuals from various locations can receive expert pain management advice and treatment. This is particularly beneficial for those who may not have easy access to specialized pain management clinics or who live in remote areas. Despite the virtual format, the quality of care is never compromised. In fact, the thoroughness and attention to detail provided by the OnCall team are on par with, if not superior to, in-person consultations I've had in the past.

Their Commitment to Patient Well-Being
I am deeply grateful for OnCall Pain Management's unwavering commitment to patient well-being. Their holistic approach considers not only the physical aspects of pain but also the emotional and psychological impact it can have. They offer comprehensive support that includes education about pain management techniques, lifestyle adjustments, and coping strategies. This holistic care approach has been instrumental in improving my overall quality of life, not just managing my pain.

Modern, User-Friendly Approach
Lastly, the modern and user-friendly approach of OnCall Pain Management deserves special mention. The platform is intuitive, the communication is prompt and clear, and the overall experience is designed with the patient in mind. Every interaction, from initial contact to follow-up, has been professional and compassionate. Their dedication to leveraging modern technology to improve patient outcomes is truly commendable.

My Personal Conclusion
My experience with OnCall Pain Management has been nothing short of exceptional. They have redefined pain management with their thoughtful, accessible, and patient-centric approach. I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking effective and empathetic pain management solutions. Grateful for their commitment to patient well-being and the modern, user-friendly approach to pain management, I can confidently say that OnCall has significantly improved my life.",2024-11-26|2024-11-25|2024-12-06|2024-11-27|2025-01-18|2024-11-25|2024-11-25|2023-12-08,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Identifies as women-owned, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|multiple_locations|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ2yXZMogFK4cRXoOs4cAIvnE,122

He is accessible and understanding, thinking ahead for what will be needed and informing me on the steps and things to think about as well as being available should something come up. I really appreciate him !!!!|In a specialty that seems to produce more negative experiences for patients than positive, Shaun Hampton and Premier Pain are a breath of fresh air! Both the providers and office staff are an absolute pleasure to work with; especially Lynne, whose kindness and expertise has helped me navigate scheduling, billing, and anything else that may pop up along the way! As someone who has been under Shaun's care for years now, I can say with full confidence that I would enthusiastically recommend him to any of my loved ones looking for a new pain management provider! From your first visit, you will be in the hands of a true healer whose genuine compassion and expertise has transformed my own pain management experience. His sincere empathy and skill create a comforting atmosphere where you are more than just another patient and instead, are treated like an individual person with unique needs and concerns. Shaun takes the time to understand not only the physical symptoms but also the emotional toll that those symptoms can produce. His insightful observations and thoughtful recommendations replace my usual feelings of anxiety and fear with trust and hope. I always leave my appointments with renewed confidence in my healthcare journey, knowing that I have a true partner alongside me.|I've never experienced such pain relief prior to Premier. Dr. Shaun and Dr. Thom truly care about their patients and you can tell how passionate they are about what they do.

Cassandra.|For months I had been dealing with pain, stiffness, and constant body aches. Came here via recommendation from a friend, and haven't stopped coming since! Super easy appointment set-up and friendly front staff. If your ever in need of Chiropractic needs, this is the place!|Shaun Hampton has provided another stellar pain management telemed appointment for both my mom (Barbara Meyers) and me. After exchanging salutations and pleasantries this morning, Shaun provided each of us with an in-depth review of our respective medical histories. His levels of care and compassion are only surpassed by his extensive medical knowledge regarding our individual chronic pain situations. Both my mom and I truly believe he not only hears our concerns and questions, but he also listens to what we're actually saying, leaving us both feeling validated regarding our expressed pain levels.

From the date of my first appointment with Shaun, up until now, I realize that I made the correct decision in choosing him to handle my individual pain management needs. The fact that Shaun helps us to realize and set personal goals for each of us, gives us hope in knowing that we can achieve said goals with his direction and help. Otherwise, it would seem to be easier to just give up, leaving my mom and me both feeling hopeless. Our day to day ""life"" (sometimes feeling more like existence) appears to be ""doable"" knowing Shaun is in our corner. Just knowing Shaun ""has our backs"" gives us the courage (despite the constant intolerable pain) to take one step...and then another...in faith, to carry on.|Great docs and ownership!

I arrived 15 minutes late after mistakenly going to a pain location with a similar name on Bell Rd., only to discover their location was on 91st--quite a distance away. As a single mother juggling an infant and a busy schedule, I rushed to their current location, hoping they would understand the honest mistake and grant me some grace as a first-time patient.

Despite the effort I put into making it there, even sending an email explaining the mix-up since they don't have a functional contact phone number, I was coldly told I needed to reschedule. To make matters worse, the doctor was already running behind, so accommodating me wouldn't have disrupted their schedule.

The lack of empathy and compassion was shocking. Any decent medical office should show understanding for new patients, especially under such circumstances. Instead, they dismissed my situation, leaving me frustrated and scrambling to rearrange child care for another day. If you're looking for a practice that values its patients, this is not the place. Their rigid policies and poor communication make it clear that patient care is not their priority.|I've been coming to AZ Pain for over a decade now. They diagnosed a compressed spinal cord and helped me manage my pain while I waited for cervical spine surgery, helped diagnose my low back pain I've had for almost two decades, have done injections in my spine for pain control, I've done PT with them (Bri and Johnny are the best!)... they offer full service that is always the BEST. And their staff is amazing! Always friendly and helpful!|*claps hands* alright let's get this straight first off, I'm not a patient, I'm actually the boyfriend of one who's been coming here and it's been nothing but fantastic. I've watched my girl struggle with issues her whole life and learning she has scoliosis after YEARS of not knowing was a massive shock and after we've been treating it, it's shown TREMENDOUS results. Nothing but love and appreciation for these guys, completely changed our lives for the better and a especially big shout out to Bre and Jonny who absolutely make this Earth a much better place to be in. Shine on!|""In-house"" defined as ""done or existing within an organization"" or ""without assistance from an outside organization; internally"".

I hurt my neck or shoulder from sport and exercise. I found this place through my united health care app. I called them around December 12th to schedule an appointment. I was getting ready to go out of town on the 20th.  The receptionist, or whoever I spoke to, had an appointment on the 21st or on January 2nd. I was assured they could do X-Rays and MRI/Imagine in house and not to worry they'd be able to take care of everything. Because of this I opted for the appointment on the 2nd.

I arrive to my appointment 30 minutes early. I'm called back and a nurse takes my blood pressure and gets my height/weight. Then a nurse practicioner comes in and asks me what happened. Then without doing a single diagnostic or ANY kind of triage or anything beyond listening to my story decides I need Pain injections and chiropractic visits multiple times a week. We spent less than 15 minutes together before she send me to someone else.

This person immediately tries schedule me for pain injections and multiple chiropractic visits a week BEFORE my imaging or anyone has done ANYTHING to triage my issue. When I tell her I don't want that treatment prior to finding out what is wrong she tells me then I need to go schedule an MRI and hands me a referral sheet!

At this point I'm very frustrated as I haven't even finished my paperwork AND I wouldn't have take the appointment on the 2nd if I knew I was going to be referred out. This person then begins to argue you with me about what ""In-house"" means.

So I included the definition of ""in house"" here. If they actually had ""In-House"" MRI I wouldn't have been given a referral sheet and told to schedule my own MRI. You will notice they have Chiropractic ""In-house"" because they didn't print me a referral.

To this person's credit they never stopped trying to get me to take the pain injections.

This place doesn't give a shit about actually helping you get better. They want your money and they want you on pain medication. I did not know that by ""Pain Specalist"" they meant Drug pushers. I was incredibly direct with both the Nurse Practitioner I didn't want pain medication for an injury she couldn't even name.

The best part is the imaging place they recommend isn't even in my network and I still had to go find my own place to get the MRI

OH and they did not recommend or do X-Rays which is typically what you would do prior to an MRI since you think you'd want to make sure my neck or shoulder didn't have any broken bones.

They must do this commonly because when I told the lady who scheduled my MRI she literally laughed and made a comment about me not being the only to say that.

TLDR;
Without triaging my injury in anyway, without doing any diagnostic, without even touching my neck or shoulder, without DOING ANYTHING this place tried to push pain medicine and treatment I might not need on my in less time than it took for me to fill out their new patient paperwork.

Disgusting. Find somewhere invested in your health and not your wallet.|I am so grateful for Dr Koc and Bre & Jonny's attention to my care.

I go to scottsdale clinic for medical, chiropractor,  physical therapy, epidural, and traction. This place is awesome and so are the people. Staff really help each other out.

I have bulging discs with nerve pain running down my leg. Not fun and kind of scary. They have helped me get back to functional with everything in 1 location, chiropractic care, physical therapy and injections. All of them combined help so much. I will continue to come here to maintain my back health even after this acute phase of healing is over. They are all knowledgeable and trustworthy providers and staff.|Big thanks to Dr. Healey for helping me out of a painful situation! The program they prescribed for me has relieved the neck pain I went in for, but it also relieved my TMJ and other symptoms. Super friendly staff, affordable pricing and easy appointment availability. 5 stars!|Exceptional service! From the moment I walked in, the staff at Arizona Pain made me feel welcomed and cared for. Dr Mitch highly knowledgeable and skilled, providing personalized treatments that have significantly alleviated my back pain. The office environment is clean, calming, and professional, contributing to a positive healing experience. I highly recommend Arizona Pain/ Phoenix to anyone seeking effective chiropractic care.""|Have been coming to Dr. Mitch for a couple of months and have had a lot of great progress in my recovery. Was in a car accident early March of this year and shortly after had a lot of tension around my upper back/shoulder area. Difficulty turning my head to the right without having to turn my entire body in order to look including soreness in my lower back. Since starting my PT and adjustments I've regained a lot of motion back in my neck and have felt a lot less tension around my upper back. My lower back has also shown great signs of relief from soreness! I appreciate the folks here for helping regain my flexibility, mobility, and relief from the accident!|I love this place! Frank and Dr. Healey are hilarious, and more importantly they care about you as a person and a patient. I have felt better going here than any other chiropractic practice. The adjustments by Dr. Healey and PT with Frank have helped more than anything has before. Go here!|I have been in constant pain for 5 years. With a level 8. I've had my share of emergency rooms, pain management, epidural injections for 4yrs, Ablations where the Dr missed the target and for 4yrs been numb in the general area. I refused opiods for treatment. I wanted to be fixed,  not pasified, and addicted. I've had countless imaging by hundreds of Dr's, but NONE of them have EVER sat me down to examine my x rays and explain in detail what's going on in my back. I finally was approved for surgery and the Dr was going to cut me open without an x ray consult. When the surgeon canceled my surgery and I was super pissed but it turned out to be a blessing. That's is when I met Dr Healy. I thought oh no, another physical therapy place, but I was wrong. Dr Healy did xrays and sat me down to show me and walked me thru my entire back. From my neck to my lower back. First time ever!!!! I was in tears! I hugged him, thanked him, and asked him to please help me. I looked into his eyes and I can tell he was all in and committed to assisting me to a road of being pain free. I am entirely greatful for Dr Healy, and his staff. You won't find any place in town that are sincere as they all are NO JOKE. I've been to so many in the past 5 years, and I had already given up on finding someone who cared enough to motivate me into another treatment plan. This time I know I'm in good hands and I'm in the right place. Thank God! I'm so happy. If your in pain, and you find nothing is helping, before you give up,  I urge you to try Dr Healy before you give up. You won't be sorry. I will keep everyone updated on my progress as it's a bit early to give a complete outcome, but I know this time it will be a success story. Thank you Dr Healy.  I can't thank you enough.
Judy Abel|10/10- would HIGHLY recommend.  Life changing experience. My chronic back pain is non existent and I can thank AZ Pain Relief for that. Everyone from the front office, to the providers to the physical therapists treated me like I was family. The professionalism, expertise and kindness in clinic is something to be said for. I would recommend anyone and everyone I know who is struggling with chronic pain to invest in themselves and pay these guys a visit. It will change your life like it changed mine! My only regret is that I waited so long to make my first appointment.|Dr. Clark, Angie, and Julie have been a fantastic team in helping me get through all the back and neck issues I've been dealing with. They do a great job of keeping things interesting and making adjustments to the treatment plan as my targeted pain areas changed and evolved. They also thoroughly discussed any necessary lifestyle adjustments that I needed to make to ensure my body won't relapse into a bad state. Even the fill-in staff has been fantastic when anyone has been out on vacation.

I go to the Globe office where I have always been treated well and like a patient rather than just another claim. Dana Cook has always listened to my questions and concerns and alleviated my anxiety's(which have been numerous). I understand treatment for my injuries are a process and do not expect immediate relief, and through communication and understanding from the Doctors and staff I not only know what to expect but trust that I'm in good hands. The receptionist Luisa makes me nervous to talk to her because I think she is truly gorgeous,but she is also very warm,welcoming and comforting and has been very professional throughout my appointments which has also helped me get through my initial anxieties. I often do not like going to any Doctors offices or Provider's because they often make me feel uncertain and untreated,but Dana Cooks office and staff continue to show they care about my health and we'll being. I recommend them 100% and trust they have my best interests at hand,so thank you for all your help.|I was a patient at this facility and was discharged on their behalf. I felt compelled to address the unprofessional behavior exhibited by the doctors and staff. I waited for over two hours while fasting, only to overhear the doctors socializing and playing loud, inappropriate music. As a patient, I believe I deserve better care than what this practice provided.

While I do acknowledge that credit should be given when it's due, it seems clear to me that this clinic does not prioritize patient care; instead, patients appear to be treated merely as insurance claims or numbers. When I raised my concerns with the office manager, they seemed indifferent and dismissed my feedback entirely.

I highly recommend seeking another clinic where you will be valued as a patient, as this facility does not demonstrate that commitment.|I've had a great experience with Sun Pain Management and Debarah so far. She's very knowledgeable, helpful, and caring. The front desk staff and medical assistants are also really friendly and make me feel comfortable. I would recommend this office to my friends and family.|I was not happy at all with services from the providers. I saw the Doctor once and the rest of the time was being seen by a nurse practitioner. I received a steroid injection  that burned the skin n as of today still have a scar in area. I called numerous times, only to have my primary care Doctor prescribe me a medication to help it heal. Third injection left me unable to walk,and again I would leave calls n messages with no reply. The answering machine said I'd get a call back 24-72 hours later and not to leave numerous messages. I still never got calls returned. I ended up in Emergency a few days after injection that cause severe pain. I never got a call back after I had to cancel next injection,  but I got a call to confirm appointment the following day. I let receptionists know I had to wait due to inflammation n pain. I was seen in Doctors office a week later and was told I needed my gamapentin put to a higher dose but it took the nurse practitioner almost a month,  so again I had to go to family physician to get medication situated. Previous visit I was in pain and my  blood pressure was high so had to get a shot of Tordal to help, it didn't help pain but I could feel my blood pressure had lowered and just went home n slept because it made me have drowsiness. Last call I told them I didn't feel I was being taken care of by nurse practitioner if I could see Doctor. Only to be told Doctor only does procedures n mind you that Doctor wasn't the one who did my injections. So I am now in a wheelchair n was told not to use it because it's doing me more harm than good, but I can't stand more than a few minutes before I have severe pain standing on right foot. I was ordered to go get a MRI n waited over two weeks before I was sent to Arizona diagnostics only to be there three n half hours and wasn't able to get imaging done because I have a internal pain device through spine/ battery and needed a order for CAT scan not MRI. That was the last straw so I had to ask family care doctor for a referral to see a new doctor because I'm not happy with the service at Sun Pain Management at all n would never recommend this place to anyone. If I was seen by a Doctor that I thought I was going to be seeing would have been different especially if calls were returned to assist patients.|My continued care and treatment with Sun Pain has allowed me to continue to do what I .

They forgot to send in my prescription, but got mad when I called and complained. If you want a pain management that doesn't take accountability, you got the right one Sun Pain is your guy.|I was with sunpain management back in early 2022, they were the absolute worst employees I have ever dealt with before. The front desk lady was rude, didn't answer calls, would hang up intentionally and never call you back. Then the nurse practitioner I would see, sent me to a neurologist after an MRI came back that I had herniated discs in my neck, spinal stenosis, and a couple other things. The neurologist I saw said to me I needed a fusion and it wasn't something he could help me with, that I needed to see an orthopedic surgeon. So I brought those results back to sunpain and requested to see and orthopedic doctor. The nurse DENIED me to go to one, she said she would not write a referral for one? So the option was to stay on oxycodone which didn't touch my pain. They only did a medial block with lidocaine and never tried steroid injections, nothing. I feel I was not only discriminated but also medical malpractice. I was there for PAIN MANAGEMENT and refused actual help. I would NEVER recommend this place. I left the day the lady denied a referral to the doctor I actually needed to see.|Horrible , This place is letting people get , four different kinds of pain pills!

I told her no, and asked her for the proper and needed imaging procedure, and she grudgingly agreed. Bottom line if you really don't know what you issue is, you should not go here, they will most likely order tests you don't need just so they can bill for it.

After many,many,many phone calls the nurses and MA got my meds to be filled that day! This may sound trivial but when you live in pain and can't get your meds, it effects you and everyone around you.
Thank you so much|Mary Steiner is an amazing person!  She checked out my spine and told me things that I haven't ever been told.  Very caring and listens to me and my concerns.  Front office is really professional as well.  Thank you!|Its certainly a wonderful feeling to know you are being treated with the up most care and respect but mainly not being treated as it's  just in your mind.

I am also going through some other procedures for my condition and knowing that their are options to assist you in your healing process to feel at least 70-80% pain free. It's so comforting knowing that their are pa's/doctors who actually care for their patients well-being, they take the time to listens to their patients and just generally cares, instead of just allowing you feeling like a pin cushion!  Its quite refreshing!!
The staff as well with AZ Pain is also very friendly every time I am in the office  and when I need procedures they are precise, when authorizations are needed for other treatments.

Mary Steiner (PA @ Mesa location), Thank you for everything you have been doing to assist me on my journey to become pain free or at least decreasing the amount of my pain greatly. You're definitely one of the best out there! She is such a sweetheart and takes her time explain your condition or the procedure(s) you're having when you get to that point. She is absolutely amazing|Honestly, the staff is great, the provider was amazing. My whole experience here was awesome! I really appreciate the doctor being sensitive to my medical circumstances and empathetic about my plan of care. I truly appreciate that she understands this is temporary care and she really did help me! I recommend this facility! 5 stars, hands down.|My Dr and the staff here has always been courteous, have patience and helpful. I've never had a problem what so ever. The Staff has always been willing to listen to my concerns and address them right away. I would forever be greatful for my care as I've been in the Healthcare industry since 1995 and this is wonderful to see people in this industry still have deep concerns and care about their patients.|01/06/2003- Friendly, professional, & informative staff. My provider is very attentive, takes the time to go through options & ensures I understand everything, is sympathetic to my suffering & I really believe she wants to help me. I'm very happy with AZ Pain Doctors & would highly recommend them to anyone who's in need of such services.

NOTE: I've seen a couple of patients deeply unhappy w/the front desk to the point of yelling & arm waving @ the woman there. This was - awfully childish behavior on the part of the patient & speaker-on-behalf of the patient - NOT the fault of AZ Pain, nor because the front desk was being rude (in fact, she remained extremely calm, polite, & highly professional throughout the entire incidents, explaining & then re-explaining why the patients just couldn't be seen), or anything she was inherently doing wrong. The patients simply couldn't be treated because of insurance issues; they were in pain & needed medication, yes, but their insurance did not allow for the appts. The facility COULD NOT LEGALLY treat them, & it had nothing to do w/whether they WANTED to treat them or if AZ Pain staff lacked in sympathy.

Now, I haven't seen any ratings on this business yet... I'm rating from a prompt from my email, so I've never googled them. I don't know how many good or bad reviews they have. But I do know that when someone can't get what they want, for example: treatment & pain meds, then that angry (& yes, suffering) person occasionally leaves one of those, ""Rude staff, doesn't care about patients in pain,"" etc. reviews. I just felt the responsibility to notate what I've witnessed. And let me just say that if those patients weren't willing to pay out of pocket (they weren't, or maybe couldn't), then insurance was the only other option.

Remember, this place is still a business & still needs to be paid, otherwise it shuts down & all of its patients are SOL. Including me... which I'm willing to admit that I'm selfishly not okay with (I'm in pain, I love this biz, I want to continue going there, I don't want them to charity themselves into bankruptcy, forcing me somewhere else), so I saw NO problem w/them refusing service to those 2 individuals who wouldn't (personally or through insurance) pay.

AZ Pain Doctors is a very GOOD business, w/very professional staff all around. They ARE caring, & informative, & willing to help out in whatever way they can in order to make sure your pain mgt needs are met - but you still have to do your part. I've had no issues w/them myself, I've made sure I follow their instructions (for example: if a long enough period of time has passed in-between visits, they'll have told me @ my last appt that I'll need a new referral from my referring dr, so I do just that: call my dr & ask for a new referral a week before my next appt w/AZ Pain. Then, when I show up @ my next appt, I don't have any issues w/my insurance & my appt goes on as normal), they are almost always on time (hey, sometimes medical facilities run late. It just happens. I've worked for a dozen diff med facilities & know exactly how that happens & it's NEVER the facility's fault - I have stories!), & I'm in & out & happy that I have all the info I need to go on & try to manage my pain.

NOTE (yet again): this is not the place to opiate shop. On my 1s appt the very 1s thing I said to my provider was, ""I'm a former addict so I refuse to take any opiates."" And she said, ""Good, because I don't prescribe them.""

So yeah, if you've gotten this far, AZ Pain Doctors is a great place & I very highly recommend it for anyone's pain mgt needs.|The staff at AZ Pain Doctors is great!

Dr Sims is a God send. He is all about preventing pain, while helping heal your current condition. Everyone here truly listens to chief complaints, concerns you may have and takes the extra time if needed to explain the benefits of chiropractic treatment. I am so grateful to have found thiss place and highly recommend to all.|My experience with medical procedures can be a testament to the importance of clear communication between healthcare providers and patients. Initially, I was scheduled for a Medical Branch Block (MBB) procedure with Dr. Ray, who had provided me excellent care during my first MBB. That procedure had gone smoothly; thanks to sedation, I felt no pain and experienced minimal bruising afterward. However, my second appointment was a different story due to a lack of communication.
When I had to reschedule my second MBB, the scheduler did not inform me that I would be seeing a different doctor, nor did the surgery center. This vital detail only became apparent as I was about to enter the operating room. Without the opportunity to discuss my concerns or preferences, I felt unprepared. The procedure began abruptly without the calming effects of sedation, causing me to react mid-procedure. The result was excruciating pain and noticeable bruising, in stark contrast to my previous experience.
In the aftermath of this second MBB, I found myself unable to put weight on my right side due to shooting pain. Simple tasks such as getting dressed, showering, and even finding comfort on the couch became impossible let alone being able to sleep and being up all night even after taking muscle relaxers for the back spasms . I also struggled with nausea and joint pain that made eating challenging. To complicate matters, I have experienced blurry vision, further hindering my ability to prepare for my daughter's engagement party this weekend. This experience highlights the critical need for clear doctor-patient communication and understanding, which ultimately impacts patient outcomes. A procedure that could have been routine and manageable turned into a significantly distressing situation. It's essential that healthcare providers prioritize patient comfort and make sure they are fully informed.|What a refreshing place to walk into. We were referred here by a friend for my mothers neck pain. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like royalty. The staff, doctors, radiologist all were so friendly and very attentive to moms pain. I can't say Thank you enough. Dr Church explained more in one visit than we'd heard from other doctors for over a year. I feel truly blessed to have found this place for mom. When checking out, Laura took fantastic care of us as well, which was sprinkles, on the icing, on the cake! Knowing there's relief for moms pain is the greatest feeling in the world. We very much recommend this facility.|Arizona Pain is a horrible corrupt company. Their management is a nightmare. They have no customer service skills and have no idea how to treat people who are in constant pain, mentally and physically. All they have done is added more pain to my life.
I called the office specifically asking about opioids and they never asked me if I was taking a benzodiazepine. When I got there for my new patient appt, the MA said they don't prescribe opioids to anyone taking benzodiazepines. And the doctor said the same thing. I declined treatment and left. There were no services or evaluations done. I was so frustrated that this wasn't handled over the phone. They had wasted my time, energy, travel, gas and my break time. The new patient appt didn't happen and yet they still billed my insurance and got $117 from them. This is a fraudulent claim, and yet, they still want more. They have been fighting me over a tiny $13 patient charge just to prove a point. And yes, I have been rude to them and I said one swear word. My insurance never should have been billed in the first place. And I am not paying the $13 to prove the same point...that THEY are being ridiculous and childish. For an office not to just write this off, just proves how unprofessional they are. Stay away from Arizona Pain!|Horrible! Waste of time!
I saw an interview on YouTube from 2 of the doctors about the MILD procedure and was impressed. I thought I'd give them a try.

Dr. Roth was very friendly, straight to the point, and made sure I understood every aspect of what we were going to do now and in the future. He used plain words and not all medical language to convey what he needed to do to help me.
If I was to add advice I would say to have the Google map location updated because it stops at the intersection instead at what building. People need to be able to get to a great doctor like Dr. Roth.|The staff is very nice. The Doctor is especially trying to help my husband with lower back pain relief, the best he can for his age. Dr. Roth is upbeat & has a positive attitude toward helping my husband dealing with this chronic pain.|Doctor Roth and his staff is the best Pain management office. I love the girls in the office they're always the most cheerful sweetest people specially Cassie, she is always so good with patients, her kindness , and how she cares for the patients  , she takes that moment to give you all the information and ensures when she sees your not going through such a good of moment she acknowledges you.

I have waited 30 minutes and more in the office.|I see Dr. Roth at this location and he has become my all time favorite doctor.  I suffer from nerve pain from surgery and this man solved my pain issues in the first try.  I had looking for a solution for over 3 years and Dr. Roth solved in 10 minutes just by asking me a few question.  My quality of life has increased so much.

My pain gone with no pain medications. He knows his stuff and is direct with you as the patient, they got me scheduled and in right away. He and his staff are very friendly and efficient. He treated my disk in my back 6 years ago, pain gone, when I noticed it starting to be in pain he was the only one I wanted and felt wouldn't string me along. Pain gone again. If your in pain don't wait, it so good to not live in pain. He's done a great job for me and family members. My mom was alleviated of her pain and has recommended several of her friend's that also had great success with Dr. V.|Dr. Vengurlekar is incredibly approachable and caring. On my consultation, he took his time in explaining the likely cause of my lower back pain, talking me through available treatment options, and thoroughly explaining how each treatment method is done and what it entails. He is incredibly skilled at what he does and has a competent and friendly team surrounding him. The team at Premier Pain Institute has helped alleviate my chronic lower back pain completely.|Having issues with both knees finally lead to consultations with Orthopedic Surgeons, both of which recommended replacement.  Not wanting to go through a low rehab, I consulted with Dr. Vengurlekar, whom I knew through one of his patients.  After reviewing the results of CT Scans on both knees, Dr. Vengurlekar recommended a series of injections.  After the completion of the series of three injections in my right knee, the pain level has been decreased to a very tolerable level which I can live with, and even play golf again pain free.  Last month we began the process on my left knee and after having my first injection, the improvement is noticeable.  I highly recommend Dr. Vengurlekar to any person that is living with pain that disrupts their daily life. His professional experience and accomplishments are very broad reaching far beyond simply pain management.  He is highly skilled, and will tell it like it is.  After consultation, his diagnosis will always address the best course of treatment for the patient.  I am grateful he provided a viable option to replacement surgery.|Dr. Vengurlekar has been my pain management doctor for many years. His devotion and care for the cause has been evident in the type of work that he does starting with the exceptional and professional staff that he hires down to the amount of care that he provides for each individual patient. Dr. Vengurlekar is caring, concern about the location of your pain and he pays an extra attention to the level of care that is needed to make you get comfortable and treated. For the past twenty five years I have been treated by Dr. ""V"" and each time I visit with him, he makes me feel like brand new again. I have recommended Dr. ""V"" to all my family members and they all have sought the help of Dr. ""V"" for their ailments. Currently,  my father and my nephew are both under his care and supervision and  they are both pain free because of his years of vast experience in the field of pain management . He is the best physician for the job!! HE IS THE BEST, PERIOD!!!!! Thanks Dr. ""V"". Michael D.|In 2003 Dr. V did my sciatica nerve and  I haven't had a problem since. I went to a pain specialist in Chandler and he was a QUACK. I was given 3 choices, cortisone shots, PRP or stem cell treatments. I searched and searched and found the Miracle Man. Dr. V he is so amazing and  wealth of information. I was at pain level 10 now I'm at 6, after only 1 treatment. I'm so excited about all of my upcoming treatments  back to work the next day is another plus. Thank you Dr. V  and all your staff.

I have been coming here for years for my back and neck. I wouldn't have use of either if it weren't for DR. V. If there is a negative review it's because they are cry babies who don't value a great doctor! Don't listen to the fake reviews!|After getting nothing but grief from The Pain Center of Arizona (useless procedures, constant unprofessionalism, the incessant pushing of pain pills) I knew I had to find another option.  I had 3 procedures and zero relief.  After some research, I found Dr. V and his office.  He is a miracle worker and I don't say that lightly. I sought treatment from him for broken vertebrae in my lower back which was causing pain, tingling and numbness in my hips and into my feet.  I began seeing him in May of 2017 and my initial consultation alone between paperwork and speaking with him was a few hours because he took the time to speak with me and understand why I was seeking treatment with him.  It was THAT in-depth.  The office staff (between Michele and Jackie and the rest) are top notch.  They know you by name and actually take care of you.  I had numerous procedures between May and December of 2017 and I feel like I have my life back.  My pain level is down at least 70%, I am standing straighter, I've been able to get active again and lose 25 pounds.  And this is ALL WITH ZERO NARCOTICS.   I am at the point where he released me from treatment in December and told me to ""call me if I need him"".  I know I will need him here and there because I will never be 100% pain free but to know that I have him in my corner and that I will actually see relief when I need it most is truly a Godsend.  I've seen a lot of doctors in my lifetime and he is, by far, the most brilliant I've ever met.|Dr. Vengurlekar is the real deal! I have known him for many many years and he has never ever let me down when it comes to getting my pain taken care of.

I am extremely disappointed with the treatment he has received after his sacral fusion procedure. Our experience with the clinic has been subpar overall. They do not provide a proper medication management plan to help him manage his pain. Instead, they quickly resorted to procedures for a young man under 30, which will have a permanent impact on his life.

Additionally, the decision to fuse only one side of his SI joint without considering his individual needs was concerning. It seems that the clinic prescribes the same medication for all patients, regardless of their specific requirements. My son had to visit the ER for medication management less than 48 hours after the operation. Despite the ER doctor's instructions to take more of the prescribed medication and contact the prescribing physician for further assistance, we were met with resistance and were ultimately denied. As a result, my son is now at home less than a week post-operation from a spinal fusion without adequate pain medication because his surgeon believes in a one-size-fits-all approach.

I am planning to report Dr. Narain to the board of medicine for his lack of care for my son, his patient.|On 07/09 I saw Jason Genko to address my 4th potential treatment for debilitating Cervical Radiculopathy. In spite of being low functioning due to pain from collapsed/bulging disks, and extreme stenosis. PT was ordered before an MRI. WENT TO PT THE NEXT DAY and it was determined that I could not participate in this PT at this time due to the extreme nature of my condition. This report was sent to PA Genko on 07/12. In the mean time I'm getting slow and indignant responses from my attempt to use their messaging system for appointments. This is a joke. They bounce you back and forth to some redundant ""scheduler "" that asks if you are a new patient, press1 or 2, are you scheduling a procedure press 1or 2, have you received confirmation to schedule this procedure? Press 1 or 2. This is after having texted directly with a person who already had all of this info and offered a slot. By the time they get back to me that slot is no longer available. This is frustrating at best. When my MRI was ordered a week later it was not ordered stat and no PT report was attached so 14 days later I get a denial requesting 6 weeks of PT. Insurance says the PT report nor his opinion attached to the MRI request. Now it's been three more weeks of agonizing pain. I get a call from the Pain center telling me the MRI denied and I need to schedule to discuss how to move forward. So I schedule for yesterday. I get there. They have no clue why I'm actually there. Jason Genko informs me he has no PT report nor does he have an xray of my hand which was also ordered for potential metatarsal tarsal injections. I tell him it was sent and confirmed and I would probably leave his office only to find out late that I'm right. It was in fact sent and confirmed sent by ""Sp*****"" PT ON 07/12. In the context of me asking him why they weren't received and reviewed by him he turned to me and bowed up and said, and I quote, ""I don't sit by a fax machine all day just waiting for a fax"". This response aggravated me as well as his poise and bedside manner. I said ""young man, I never suggested that was the case but why would it not be there. Can we look again? Perhaps somewhere else? He raise both hands palms towards me in passive-aggressive and bemused manner and fixed his gaze and said ""I don't know"". At this point I went off and demanded to be seen by someone else even if it meant scheduling again. I expressed my anger for his exasperating dismissal of me and my situation and that I felt every step of the process was confusing and not aided by discussion or explanation by him and that I didn't appreciate his bold and disrespectful response. He said he was leaving the room and I could leave the practice. Beyond appalled my trigger was pulled. I told him how frustrating this all was and that I would report him and take my business elsewhere. He said ""GOOD, GOOD and pointed me to the door. As I was leaving the Medical assistant, standing listening in her office doorway also pointed me out the door with a sweep of her hand. I was absolutely aghast and as angry as I have probably ever been. How dare a wet behind the ears middle of the road practitioner treat me and my situation with such disregard and to bow up on me was just all that. Really? How dare you. I'll point out that in all of the frustrating and humiliating bureaucracy they seem to have their billing down to a science,  They were paid within a day or two in every case. Isn't that just a hoot?|I give 2 stars as this practice used to be sooo much better and I have been with them over 15 years, but seeing decline over last 5 years in a lot of great long- term doctors and PAs leaving. This review is in regards to my most recent appointment in June 2024 for a radio frequency, ablation procedure . Waiting 2.5 hours to get to the point ( taken back to get IV started)  and then another wait for getting actual procedure done is unacceptable.If a doctor has a valid reason for that, I would like to hear it, apparently this delay was happening all morning so a call should have been made advising patients to arrive later or re- schedule. Not enough seats in waiting room for all the people waiting ( 25 to 30) Patients plus drivers. If this was an over- booking scenario, even more unacceptable. Can't eat or drink and one person was diabetic, I had to pay my riding service more money and my driver had to re- schedule one of her appointments. Doctor should respect that their  actions or practices have a domino effect. No one poking around in spinal cords, administering medications should be rushed.  My procedure and after care felt rushed in the staffs attempt to herd people through. Unacceptable, I am going to start looking at other pain management practices. My last few  prescription refills have been a mess and the 2nd time an insurance pre-authorization was messed up. Seen quite a few doctors and experienced PAs leave this practice and this may be a huge red flag. No one wants huge waits and feel like a spinal procedure is being rushed with no concern after the procedure for increased pain and nausea. Very disappointing process and many people in that waiting room felt the same and heard at least 4 say time to look for another doctor. I also have nausea with anesthesia and they always give me Zofran during procedure into IV and give me a little more in recovery if needed. I felt more pain after this procedure than I ever had with RFA and was nauseous and they offered me crackers. No concern. They used to prescribe me nausea medicine to have on hand at home but their PA not the doctor decided to stop refilling that medication. I asked the nurse to have the doctor contact me regarding that and I never heard a word. I couldn't figure out why I felt so bad after this procedure and then realized upon looking at my discharge paperwork ( next day) that I got absolutely no Zofran as part of this procedure and they refused to give it to me in  recovery because they were so busy rushing everybody out because they were so far behind on their appointment. This is so unacceptable. This is not how you build peoples confidence People as patience. As noted I have been 15+ years and may have to consider other arrangements|I am going to have to agree with Sam's review. Dr Narain did the same thing to me & I believe every negative review of Dr Narain, he's a joke. If I could give him negative zero stars I would. I felt discriminated against the minute he walked through the door. I was seeing Dr Curletta for quite a few years before he retired (I don't blame him for retiring from this pathetic place. He lasted a whole 5-6 months & I can see why) & I ended up having to see Dr Narain. WORST Dr that I have ever encountered in my life!!!
He would not listen to anything that I had to say regarding my back pain & keep in mind that I have been going to pain centers/clinics for the last 30 years & have had every procedure done that can be done to my back, multiple times.
The Drs have all come to the conclusion that it is most likely pain from failed back syndrome & also extreme inflammation from my Hashimotos & that they would just keep me on my pain medication protocol that I have been on which is Tramadol, have been on forever (30 years) & it helps a lot. Some pain Drs laugh because that drug shouldn't even be considered a controlled drug, which it wasn't when I started on it. It doesn't make you high.
And because I took a Xanax while having a heart attack, which was legally prescribed to me as well, ( I showed him the bottles) he had a conniption fit & came at me like the Tazmanian Devil.
Mind you, I was on Xanax & tramadol for about 20 years before I even came here. My cardiologist said that the Xanax is probably what saved my life & they also prescribed it to me in the hospital while I was there along with my tramadol.
Because I continued to take it periodically because of high stress & I didn't want to have another heart attack which Dr Curletta completely understood, Dr Narian dropped me from the pain management part of the practice but not the procedure part. All he does is push procedures whether you have had them or not and if you don't agree with him he refers you to get help for drug abuse & dismisses you by writing HIGH OPIOID USAGE across your papers. He wrote that because my Xanax script was older & that no one was watching me. Trust me, if I was going to die from it, I would have died years ago. I only take .25mg of it when I do take it but am prescribed 1.50mg per day. Big deal.
He left me in the room crying, with no care in the world to listen to what I had to say. I sat there for 25 minutes so I got up & left. I told the girl at the front desk that Dr Narian was causing me a lot of distress (which is why I was put on Xanax to begin with. I have PTSD & other things & he was triggering them) so I was leaving & if they wanted to send me anything then they could. 2 weeks later I receive dismissal paperwork. I am here to tell you that us pain patients are already fragile enough from dealing with pain 24/7 & there is no reason to be treated that way by a so called professional. I have done everything & anything that any pain Dr has asked of me to do with no problems at all & now Dr Narian wants to start at the top AGAIN with procedures just to make money. You mean zero to him if you are just on a maintenance plan to get refills. This was my first appointment with him. I also paid to get my medical records from him & he has lies in them. I would RUN as fast & as far away from Dr Narain as you can & this Pain Center.
No joke,I would rather throw my money out the car window than ever giving it to him. After 30 years of pain centers/clinics I am done with them all. They were fine up until about 7 years ago with the exception of Dr. Curletta, he truly cared & it has been a constant fight since.
I have since found my own meds & they are not from a pain center.

Screw Dr Narain!!! & this Center but don't forget their motto: 

""At The Pain Center, it's our mission to develop strong patient-provider relationships before recommending therapies for pain. Once we've administered a thorough evaluation, we use a number of pain management techniques to tackle your pain head-on. Simply put, your needs are always made a top priority""

Bull Sh*t!!!|I was told this location stopped offering telehealth appointments, so now I have to drive out here every time I have an appointment. It also takes about 15 minutes to get ahold of anyone in scheduling.|This office is very exceptional! Dr. Narains staff is Very kind and genuinely listened and cared about My pain and how they could help. I did a 7 day test trial on a Implant prior to a surgery. during which Walker consistently called me and asked about my Pain to check on how I was doing.
Would for sure recommend.|Dr Narain is professional and what I consider superb giving epidurals. I've been getting epidurals in all areas of my spine and RFA's for years. I've had bad experiences. I've had one other most excellent Dr that retired. Dr Narain rates up with my last Dr. I've been looking for over a year, to find a Dr.|I'm still getting over the trauma of my last provider, AZ Pain Doctors (3 years with them). Staff and doctors here at TPC, have been amazing and have helped me regain trust through their treatment towards me as a patient, not a customer. Instead of leaving every appointment and procedure frustrated and upset (like with my last office), I leave content and confident, feeling heard, understood and updated on upcoming surgeries, procedures and tests.

They are available in real-time should something go wrong at home. I'm not waiting weeks and weeks to see them when something needs to be addressed urgently. I feel more a part of my medical team and not just their subject. It is refreshing.

And when it comes to scheduling procedures and surgeries, they aren't scheduled months out but weeks. That's a very big improvement and they watch orders submitted for prior authorization as often as they can. Meaning I don't have to do it, like I did in my last clinic. It's not perfect, and it will take some time for them to know me and my complex medical history but we will figure it out, as we have been since I first entered their practice.",2024-09-20|2024-08-02|2024-06-21|2024-05-28|2024-10-01|2023-12-27|2024-05-30|2023-09-06,1|1|2|1|1|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,telemedicine_available|long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJbT1r54WsK4cR0uHkqYI76a4,150

While checking in for epidurals, clerk signing us in said they were going to deny us service due to non payment.... we were up to date.. after an arguement they permitted the epidurals.

The day before another epidural appointment, they called us and said we couldn't get the epidural until after another office visit... Then why did you set our appointment? That left us with a great deal of pain for an extended period of time.

We were left sitting in a nearly empty office for 45 minutes and were finally called back only to be told that the technician didn't even know we were there.

Over a year ago Dr. Christine Haddad joined the practice.  I have been getting pain injections in my back, knees and shoulder forover 10 years. Of all the doctors that I have been too, Dr. Haddad is the least painful.  I have always gotten anesthesia for my back injections.  No need for that with Dr. Haddad.  She is that good.  I have received pain injections in my shoulder for just a few years. Dr. Haddad is the only doctor that has given me two different injections in that shoulder.  She saw something that other doctors didn't see.  Her entire team is excellent.  They are personable, compassionate and very knowledgeable.
From my experience, I HIGHLY recommend them. They will take good care of you.|I went to my 1st appt and it went great, I got an injection in my shoulder and that went great. I had a follow up call and that went great. After the followup call, I was supposed to get a second injection and a pain cream prescription but no one ever followed up. I left two messages and no call back. I am still in pain amd don't want to call a 3rd time. I have to start all over with a new pain doctor. Thanks for ignoring me I feel really taken care of.|I originally met with Dr. Hadadd and she was incredible! Not only do you feel heard but you can tell she truly cares. I now see her PA-C, Victoria Carpenter and I love seeing her every month because she's so helpful. I'm doing better than I have in a while. I would recommend these women to anyone I know! Thank you guys for being amazing!|Dr. Haddad gave me 2 separate injections for diagnostic purposes. She was professional, helpful and clearly explained the procedures. The results will now enable me to get much needed surgery. She also has a very good beside manner with patients! She is absolutely a valuable asset to Valley Pain and the medical community.|I like coming to this facility because everyone kind and caring. Also Ms. Nancy makes sure that your concerns are addressed immediately! Plus Dr. Victoria is very thoughtful and thorough with your health needs and concerns. I wish I could think of the other staff names at this time. But everyone in the office are awesome! Thank for all you do.|Always have been very good to me I think everybody else also that is in the office whenever I'm there. Never heard anything bad or even close to that, from any of the other patients in the office. So that's it real good.

Everyone is super welcoming and in a lot of ways has become a family to me as I routinely come in weekly, but more recently had to have emergency appointments and the staff Garrett and Andy came in when I was in pinch thank you.

I come to this place at least once a week and today I didn't get my massage because some of the therapist were leaving and they called my daughter back for her scheduled time to see medical. They were running at least 30 minutes late. So by the time we were out of the room only my daughter got a massage. I love this place. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

Their billing team is a nightmare! I had originally agreed to an out of pocket amount during my consultation which covered my visits, injections and adjustments. I paid off this amount in two installments, however i was hit with huge outstanding bill after 2 months! Apparently the office did not provide the documents necessary to justify the need for the xrays and other services they asked me to have during my consultation when billing my insurance. When I called the office about this they directed me to billing, billing told me this was an insurance issue and when I started a claim and called my insurance they said the billing department was unresponsive and hard to get a hold off. I am still going back and forth with their billing and my insurance in order to get the outstanding amount taken care of (pt ended Sept '23).

Since day 1 I've had issues at this place, my chiro asked them to contact me to make an appointment for medical due to a car accident injury. Two weeks went by with no contact. Finally I get an appt in and the person in the front was so confused on why I was there. I met with a dr for her to just tell me there's no way I'm still feeling pain even after I described my pain. She then offered some injections (epidural) and I agreed. I finally get the approval from attorneys and I request an email stating I have an appointment for my employer. They send me a vague one saying ""so and so has an appointment on this day"" no time or any other info. I ask them to please send me one with the time and recommendations such as someone to drive me there and back. Crystal calls me and says they can't do that because of HIPPAA. So you can't send me the patient and email stating ""you have an appointment on this day at this time . We recommend you to bring someone to drive you there and back"" same info I was give on the phone but in writing to my email? I would've loved to give my job a heads up about this as I've missed work due to my injuries and I'm required to document it. I decided to cancel my appointment as I no longer trust or feel heard as the patient.|Dr. Fox brings such a native and intuitive understanding of his patients to this practice. I'm so glad this clinic opened and everyone is so friendly. His staff is big on going the extra mile and I'd highly recommend to anyone. It can be hard on you to open a new business but Dr. Fox has years of experience and it clearly shows.  I don't review many businesses but felt the need to recommend this one.|Dr. Fox is an amazing chiropractor.  I recommend him to everyone. I have recommended him to my sister and her husband, who are moving to the area soon, and they are very excited to try him out. He knows his anatomy and is also very caring. Highly recommend seeing Dr. Fox at this clinic.|I spent most of my adolescence going to chiropractors for sports related injuries. 25 years later I've found one who can really help. Dr Fox is highly skilled and a master of his craft. He isn't just some code talking doc but he explains what he is doing so that I can avoid the pitfalls that landed me in his office in the first place.|Dr. Fox and his staff are very caring and attentive. They do a good job to help their patients recover. They are a great team to work with.|I have struggled with back pain from a car accident and was missing time at work. Dr. Fox was able to help me. Now I am hiking again and my back feels so much better. The staff is always very friendly and knowledgeable.|I decided to write about my experience at Pain Stop Maryvale because I know that it can help you the same way it has helped me. I started going because I was having neck pain. I was having trouble sleeping and I would experience back pain while at work. Ever since I started getting treatment and adjustments I've started feeling better and I'm not having problem sleeping anymore. I look forward to my appointments because their staff is very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this office to anyone that is experiencing pain. It's a great place to go and get help.|So about a year ago I came here after I got into an accident while my case was going on. Before the accident I felt good I was doing great. Once the accident happened I was in so much pain I could barely walk my back hurt so bad. So I went to painstop maryvale on 71st Avenue and Thomas. I talked to sherry and told her about my incident and she made me go through the whole process. After the treatment she never gave me a call
Back or followed up with me. A few months later I got a call from my Lawyer saying that she told him that the injuries in my back were not due to the most recent accident I was in, that they were from previous accidents. Well of course they were from previous accidents but I felt great before and then it was reaggravated during my most recent accident and she failed to tell my lawyer that. I was in a car accident and was in the hospital all for her to tell me that my injuries weren't from that accident which made me feel awful. With that being said, my lawyers told me that I was lying about my injuries. So I got stuck with a lower settlement because of what sherry said. Or I'd be left with nothing. Sherry ended up getting a much bigger share of the settlement than I believe she deserved because of the words she used and I was left with much less than I deserved. I do not recommend this chiropractic office. Her words made everyone look at me as a liar and I felt extremely betrayed. All they wanted was money they didn't actually care about helping me,and I know that because I didn't get any call about my treatment afterwards. She shouldn't have made me go through the whole process for her to just say it wasn't from the accident, knowing it was. If you are in a similar Situation I would suggest having a lawyer double check everything or look elsewhere for treatment.",2024-12-27|2018-07-31|2018-07-31|2019-01-11|2021-07-08|2019-01-11|2018-07-28|2020-08-20,1|5|5|5|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|multiple_locations|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJgRlgNBUVK4cRpDwwUo9mN80,28

Every time I've called with any questions I've spoken to the front desk receptionist, Priscilla, who has always been, patient kind and helpful when I had to cancel and reschedule twice due to sickness.
And nurse, Casie-she's here there and everywhere, is great too, putting me at ease with her straight forward demeanor to answer any questions I've had regarding my medications, and during the prep time for readying me for the anesthesia, and making sure I understand the process, and helping me and post injections care, and getting me safely to my car, her assistant, Ashley(?), was so friendly as well, which put me at ease the day of my injections.
Sean, who seems to be the all-around can do whatever is needed guy, did a great job of putting me at ease for my blood draw-so good that I only had a tiny spot where the blood draw needle went in-which I usually, in other blood draws, always leave with a large bruise... and his knowledge regarding the blood draw put me greatly at ease about the whole process pre-injections, leading up to  the day of my PRP / A2M injections, for general idea of how it all works.
I briefly met Dr. Lundquist, and her friendly personality upon introduction, and bright smile put me at ease as well.
The anesthesiologist, George, really put me at ease pre going under, and especially the regarding thoughts I had about a medication I take, which I had to stop taking pre-procedure, and very importantly when best to start the medication back up post injections procedure.  Very thorough and friendly, putting me at ease.

Thank you!|After reading the reviews and my initial interaction with the front desk, I was very optimistic about this place.  But after an hour of waiting and no one checking in on me, I've decided not to reschedule my appointment.  My appt was at 10am (12/16).  I was asked to come in at 930am to fill in the necessary intake forms.  I came in before 930, filled out the intake forms and was actually called back at 10:10... not bad for a 10am appt.  I can understand that doctors may be a little late and from the reviews,  it seems that the doctors really take the time to listen and understand the patient.  So, it wasn't lost on me that some appointments may run over as I can appreciate the provider making sure the patient was getting the best care possible.  But an hour later, I was still in the room.  No one had come to see me to see how I was doing or say that the doctor was running late.  It has been an hour and a half since being there and I couldn't wait any longer.  I went back up to the front desk to check on how long it would be. I was  told that he still had 1 more patient before me.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't wait anymore.  After stewing on it for a day, I just can't see myself rescheduling.  Having to take a day off from work, the long wait, and no one checking in on me... that kinda soured me on the entire situation. Hopefully someone will read this and use this as a learning experience.  Checking in on the patient and maybe giving them a heads up on any delays if possible.|Struggling a little with foot drop due to some lumbar back issues,  but couldn't of  asked for a better Dr than Dr Burgher to help get me through this challenging time with his wealth of knowledge,  amazing bedside manner, and coming up with a great plan of action.

I highly recommend Arizona Pain Relief if you're searching for compassionate and effective treatment for your pain.|Dr Frogley and his medical staff are great, but I had a major issue regarding collections. Initially I was to pay $2,164.65 for my portion of my care. I was to pay no more and that my insurance already paid $7,000 for my spinal shots. However, two weeks later I get a bill for $174.98 covering $25 per visit for my treatments. When I mentioned to the girl, Chloee in the billing department about her saying  that I would be paying no than the initial  $2,100 +, she said ""there must be a mistake, let me look into that."" The following week she told me that she made a mistake and that I was to pay an additional $45 per week to cover the therapy and chiropractic treatments. This is totally unprofessional. she is now saying that I will have to stop my scheduled shots or something else to correct the matter. To me that is like purchasing a car and then the salesman saying we are going to remove your radio or air conditioning because I made a mistake. I' be been in sales myself, and when I made a mistake I found ways to correct it, and have NEVER asked the end user to pay more than the quoted price! My suggestion would be for anybody going there to get you costs all in writing and signed, stating that there would be no more future costs. Update: We are currently trying  to work things out via negotiations. I hope we can because Dr. Frogley, Pat, and Jamie deserve all the best!|My experience at Arizona Pain Relief in Anthem has been nothing short of amazing. The staff is very personable and they really take the time to listen.

From the moment I walked into her office, I felt like more than just a patient--I felt truly cared for as a person.

Jen is cleaning a critical part of this location and there would be a huge decline in care provided and functional operations of the office if she was not there. Jen is not only highly skilled and knowledgeable but also compassionate and attentive. She takes the time to explain everything clearly, listens to your concerns, and ensures you feel comfortable every step of the way. It's clear that she genuinely cares about her patients' well-being, both physically and emotionally.

I began at the Scottsdale office location and as the practice has grown over the years,  I then moved on to receive my care at the Glendale office location. I am writing this review to let others know of the caring, courteous, and qualified team of employees who have provided me with exceptional customer/patient service at the Glendale office location.

First, I want to thank Jennifer Sutton, FNP for always taking the time to listen to me. I always feel listened to and I so appreciate her candor when we are discussing treatment/options. Jennifer is so thorough and she always makes me feel valued and respected as a patient.

Secondly, I want to thank both Kim and Audrey for their timely responses when providing me solutions whenever I leave voice messages asking for scheduling changes or requesting prior authorization requests or simply needing clarification on an issue.  Both Audrey and Kim have directly made things easier for me through effective time management of my monthly appointments, or by offering me a telephone appointment as a solution whenever a last minute conflict arises in my schedule.

Thirdly, I want to thank additional members of the staff,  Diana, Katera, and Manderz. The interactions I have had with them in either a front or back office capacity or as part of a lab collection interaction have all been provided to me with the utmost professionalism and kindness.

In closing, I commend the entire staff at the Glendale office location for a job well done.

Considering I have had to take this medication for 30 years off and on, one day ahead would be considerate, no we can't have that, if I couldn't get out that day, out. I absolutely do not feel cared for at all, and I have been with your company for years. I wish I could say thank you, I am not hurting, though that is not the case, I fractured my lower back twice and it is excruciating all the time, I screws and plates, degenerative disc, bulging discs, spinal stenosis, arthritis I am extremely grateful to be walking etc. I am extremely tired of being in pain 24/7 yet I am in pain management, begging for pain management. I don't know what else to do anymore .|I've been a loving loyal patient of integrity pain & wellness coming on like 7 to 8 years. I have nothing but good things to say about my care here. As someone who has Army injuries and been through 4 severe motorcycle accidents with life time permanent and painful injuries, someone with dextroscoliosis, severe neuropathy and other things, this place helped me out during probably the darkest time of my life. As a single father, they have allowed me to be as functional in my daughters life and be a part of it as much as I can be despite everything I have wrong! And that I can never ever thank them enough for!!! From my nerve burn injections to my medications/pain management plan, to my MRI & nerve study tests, Jennifer Sutton who I've been seeing for about two years maybe 3 has always put my concerns on the top of my total care plan. To Dr Patel who does my nerve burning injections in my cervical neck and lumbar spine. Sometimes they can be very painful depending on how my spine & neuropathy is acting up on that given day. But well worth the extra pain. as I don't do sedation just because of bad problems with major surgery sedation of previous other doctors not related to this place. But 99% of the time the injection pain subsides about 3-7 days later along with relieving pain in said areas by about 30-50% and giving me better sleep and daily life functions!! That I otherwise would not have! I cannot thank them enough!|I brought my Father-in-law to this location for tests that he needed. I was his driver and was waiting with him.  After waiting more than 45 minutes he needed to use the restroom. When I asked the person behind his desk where the bathroom was she informed me that the restroom was for patients only. I understand they don't want people walking in off the street to use their restroom, but to not allow someone waiting with the patient to use it is ridiculous.  After he was done and we were back in the waiting area another patient entered and the person with her inquired about using the restroom and he was directed to the gas station outside of the complex and told he could go over there.  I am glad I will never have to go back to this place.

Edited to respond to their response: There was only ONE other patient in the waiting area, this was NOT a busy time. The person that I spoke with was VERY rude to me when I asked about the restroom, despite the fact that she had checked my Father-in-law in, knew I was with him and saw me pushing him in his wheelchair. It seemed pretty obvious to me that HE was the one that needed the restroom, I certainly would not bring him with me if I need to use it.|Jennifer is an amazing doctor and always listens to my problems and concerns and makes sure I have what I need to feel better

For the most part I've lived a fairly active life and thankfully Dr. Ray, and NP Salazar (I think I spelled that wrong) have continued to allow me to keep living it. When I moved here a little over two years ago, I left a great pain management Dr who really helped me regain my life and retain my dignity as a chronic pain patient. To say I was worried, was an understatement. As I've heard pain management care in Phx is  abysmal. In fact, the first two pain dr's I went to were horrid and treated me like a drug seeker (I, in fact, refuse most pain meds). Az pain doctors restored my faith and have kept me functioning. Even their front desk staff is amazing and caring. Heck, they know you by first name basis there. You never feel like another number there. I'd definitely recommend (and have) to anyone who is looking for compassionate and effective pain management.|Staff very nice. Jonathan Salazar the NP, was very informative and took his time explaining everything. I'm excited about working with this pain practice to resolve my back problems. Highly recommend them. I had a pain management Dr. I was seeing, he left his practice suddenly and no one knows where he went.|They're always so kind there they do me good they put shots in my knee so I can walk preventing myself from having to have surgery.

I highly recommend this office to provide care for the health issues I need.|I always have a wonderful experience when I go there my doctor is great and the nurses are very respectful and kind.|The whole team is awesome.!! Dr.Salazar does an incredible job. He listens to you and helps you and every way above and beyond his job I would recommend him to anybody who struggles and needs pain management.!!|They are amazing, the staff is friendly and very caring. John Salazar is so caring and very understanding.  I just started going to this facility and already feeling better. Thank you|Dr David Ray has been a true lifesaver for me.

The appointment was for 1:45, I got there at 2:03.  I was told I had to check in at 1:30!!! The girl said I should of called to say I was running late.  I said why, you can never get through to a person so why bother????  I started having a panic attack and tearing up.  While I was standing there another young lady called my name to come back for my appointment and the one who CANCELLED me took it out of her hand and said I was CANCELLED.  I said I needed to be seen  in person.  My husband is having open heart surgery on the 20th and I can't come back for a while.  They said they didn't have any openings and they had a virtual appointment with Rick Allen.  I was told this was my only option so I took it.  While I was in the parking lot the Mesa office called for virtual appointment and I asked the young lady if Rick was in the office and if I could come in and see him since I was already up in Phoenix.  She said yes!!!  We drove over, the appointment was about 7 to 8 minutes and we drove back to Yuma.  When I have seen Dr. Leathem in the past, he has said  that since we drive 3 hours away he would still see me.  I apologized for being late.  I usually have a positive experience with staff and doctors.|Another example of a medical practice that could care less about your wellness. I am a young dad in my 30's, but I had a double spinal fusion 3 years ago. My wife and I both called to confirm that the treatment I utilize was offered by ASAP, and we both were told yes on recorded calls. At my intake appointment, the provider talked to me like a piece of gum on the bottom of his shoe, and quickly told me that I would need to find a different provider. I have never experienced such poor ethics or bedside manner. Fortunately Phoenix is a massive market, and my business and care will be provided for elsewhere. I would not recommend this provider.|My experience was very good, and better than I expected.|I want to publicly thank Dr Richard Allen and Dr Jason Neilson for, not only the care that they have provided, but for the hope that they have given me.
My pain due to a hereditary disease, multiple injuries, and a few surgeries that didn't go right have left me in so much pain that my wife and I had to make the hardest decision, to live in separate states so that I could get the medical care that I needed and also so that my negativity would not affect my son as he grows up. It was so hard to see beyond my pain that that had become my only reality.
With the help of Advanced Spine and Pain and their staff, I have quality of life in this moment. I'm not 100% out of pain or any where near but it has been drastically reduced and I've been able to FaceTime with my family and laugh and smile and hear about their days instead of just complaining as I'm writhing in pain.
On top of that they have given me hope that with nerve blocks, minimally invasive surgery (if necessary), braces, and some at home traction that I will most likely have reduced my pain to have a fairly normal life. Which is not what I've heard from my doctors in the past. I've had so many warnings and so many times been given the worst case scenarios as my only option that I've become agoraphobic and a hypochondriac.

He told him that HealthChoice (AHCCCS) would not pay for the procedure and it would be $500 out-of-pocket.  He paid it and had the procedure, which didn't relieve the pain.  After speaking with our insurance company, we found out that they would've paid for it.  We called the office and spoke with the rude ""office manager"" and asked them to submit the bill and reimburse my husband.  She refused and said they don't submit to any AHCCCS plans, yet they accepted it for the initial office visit.  If you still end up there for treatment and have AHCCCS, call your insurance company and ask if the procedure is covered.  It's obvious they're out for money and I would steer clear of this company.|I can't thank Dr. Khan enough for the incredible care and relief he's provided for me over the course of my treatment. He has helped me manage multiple areas of pain and I am able to enjoy my daily life without being held back by the constant discomfort. If you're struggling with pain, I highly recommend Dr. Khan!|Edit: I've decided not to go here anymore since they won't give me relief where it's painful and swollen. Dr Ryklin thinks ""minimal disc bulge"" is insignificant and that's unacceptable!
If it hurts then they should do something!
I've been in pain all year. Every MRI I've had is changing for the worse. Several issues here and there throughout whole spine. No matter what I tell Kaitlyn about certain areas that hurt, Dr Ryklin has his own plan.. He doesn't like to talk much at all. Just stick with needles and out the door. Meanwhile the rest of my back is in pain!
Whenever I get sedation, the lady always blows my vein and has to do it again on other arm. And it is true what other reviews say about staff when calling/front desk people... They seem clueless and/or somewhat rude.
I thought a place like this would have more sympathy about pain. I'll go somewhere else!

They were great for the first year, then their service started plummeting. So I decided to seek treatment elsewhere and get a fresh look at my lower back pain.

I came in for two injections and at the last minute, I had to back out when he told me they only offer Xanex for relief. I cannot take Xanex as it makes me feel sick and anxious (I understand the irony, as Xanex is supposed to relieve anxiety). I've had countless injections in the past and tried them without sedation... worst mistake of my life. I squirmed so bad, they had to hold me down. I thought I was a tough guy till that day.

I have suffered from chronic low back pain for years. I recently pinched my Sciatic nerve, which is a new injury, and it was the most pain I have endured in my 67 years of life. I was forced to come in for an appointment with Nurse Practioner Julie Overbey as they wouldn't allow a zoom appointment even though I was in excruciating pain. I mean tears from a grown man type of pain. At this brief appointment, I told her my regular pain meds were not even slightly helping the pain. After begging, she prescribed a week's worth of additional pain meds, that were actually a less strength mg dose than my existing pain meds, and I scheduled some injections in my back. I called, and called leaving message after message stating the additional pain meds were not working, and it was going to be an additional week or more before I could get in for the injections. I could not even get a call back, they just ignored my messages. Meanwhile, they had sent a message to my primary Dr. for approval, and they didn't even check back when they hadn't heard anything from him. I had to schedule a zoom appt with my primary Dr. to explain I need approval from him, which he knew nothing about. I'm changing Pain Management doctors after dealing with mediocre service at best, and they are closed on Fridays. I would not recommend Sun Pain Mangement to anyone.|Julie is amazing!

Also their billing has been so easy to work with as well. Thank you Miss Julie and to everyone on your staff :)|Great doctors here and the staff too. I see my pain doctor every month, (usually through Zoom).  When I told her I was starting to have pain in my knees when I have to squat down, she suggested some injections. Two injections (Which by the way are quick and not really painful, like if you accidentally stuck your finger with a pin.), and no more pain in my knees.|Love Sun Pain! Everyone is so kind and nice.

Kind EMT & nurse. Dr V came in & explained exact procedure to my spouse. Overall, I felt very cared for in a professional environment.|In February of this year, I had my first appointment with Dr. Gupta, which lasted about 15 minutes. During our discussion, we both agreed that Mountain View was not equipped to assist me with my type of spinal injury. I accepted this outcome and paid the $40 copay. However, later in the year, I received an itemized bill from Mountain View detailing the charges they submitted to my insurance company, and I was outraged. In addition to the office visit charge, they billed hundreds of dollars for behavioral health care and pain management services--neither of which I received.

This highlights a significant issue within the healthcare system. In the future, I believe patients should have the opportunity to review charges before they are sent to insurance companies. Implementing such a process could reduce instances of overbilling and help lower healthcare costs for everyone.|After 10 years of different doctors and drugs that have not helped with my daily headaches, I feel like I finally have a partner who with diagnose and treat my pain.

We called our insurance like they wanted and our insurance covered it and they said they we didn't need a referral to see them. And on arizona pain and spine center they even said they take referrals from patients and doctors so we figured it wouldn't be a problem. So we called them back and they said they needed a referral from the doctor, which would have been nice to know the first time we called since we wasted so much time. So we called our primary and got them to send a referral but by that time arizona pain and spine was closed. We called first thing in the morning to make sure they got it and they told us to call back on monday!

That is the most pain I've actually felt in any doctors office, during any procedure. When I got home I canceled all future appointments. I still have severe back issues and can't hardly walk at times. But I will not go back to that clinic. I'm going to find somebody who can actually help me without causing massive amount of pain.|I usually never write reviews, however this clinic truly deserves one. Dr. Hair is one of the most compassionate doctors i have ever met!! He took a lot of time with me, attentively listened to me and made me feel like I was important to him. Never once did he try to rush me out the door,  and was determined to find anything he could to help me gain some mobility. Dr. Hair clearly went into medicine because he profoundly cares about helping people. I cannot say enough about how amazing he is!!! One of the best doctors I have ever met. Thank you to the pain center and Dr. Hair for making me feel well taken care of and like what I am going through is important. I am very fortunate to be one of your patients|Belittle my questions rushed through steps had to stick me 3x for IV did not perform procedure explained at previous kept looking me as was asking a stupid question did not explain post op instructions handed me paper and told me to read it later|I have been struggling with pain for years. I had the worse experience at TOI with Dr. Chen putting me through the worse pain possible. Dr. Donald Hair was very attentive and his assistant Jessica Ruiz listened to my fears and both made me feel reassured and comfortable. Let me say Dr. Hair has the hands of an angel. I felt no pain, in fact I didn't even realize he did anything and was surprised when he said he was finished. I'm am so happy that I found a Dr. that truly cares about his patients.

I got an I jection and it messed up my back completely. I was suppose to have a dr apt on the 19th instead of another procedure but they def still have both open still. I called to schedule the procedure since I had canceled it and was gonna do a dr visit. Called to set up and the woman was crazy sick..sounded like death and just repeated everything I said to her lol (SO NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT IM SAYING)and then was rude lol after all i had done was be nice...WHAT!! DOUBLE THINKING THIS PLACE|Dr. Jae H Park is a negligent provider who creates adversarial relationships with his patients while disregarding their needs and disrespecting them as people.

I attended an appointment yesterday  as a patient advocate, and thank God I did, because doctors in this field specifically love wielding the authority of their position to mistreat patients and then act as if it is normal. You can't do that when someone else is there to call out your abysmal behavior.

We waited at least 40 minutes in the waiting room alongside a patient who was scheduled at the exact same time as us at a clinic with one doctor. We witnessed the two patients before us exit their appointments EXTREMELY upset, stating Dr. Park is a terrible provider who treated them both poorly, and how this treatment had them both immediately relocating. One patient stated Dr. Park had pressured them into treatment they weren't comfortable with while denying medication. When we were called back for vitals we waited an additional 10-15 minutes for Dr. Park to arrive.

During the appointment he barely made eye contact with us and clearly was not engaged in the conversation. He downplayed my partners symptoms and failed to discuss significant findings in MRI and xray results, and when we brought them up tried to imply they were normal. He made us both argue for a doctors note for a prior reaction to medication that put my partner out of work, and that he could not obtain until this appointment due to this clinic relocating every other provider resulting in last minute cancellations. He was intermittently smiling during all of this, and when we asked for the note specifically he laughed right in front of us. He tried to prescribe medication as my partner was telling him that specific medication no longer worked for him. He tried to tell us it is regular to wait an hour to see a specialist, when my partner's last prescriber saw him at the exact time he was scheduled, however that doctor was a professional who actually cares about his patients. He told us to lower our voices while we were talking at a normal volume simply because we were pushing back on every nonsensical thing he said. As my partner became increasingly upset at having to argue for any basic treatment or respect and I continued to disrupt Dr. Parks attempts to normalize his horrendous maltreatment of his patients he clearly realized this appointment was ending like the last two he had that morning. He finally conceded to a doctors note and prescribed meds. My partner took a moment to calm down and then scheduled at another location with the receptionist.

It should be noted that the nurse and receptionist we saw were both very professional and kind. The issue here is Dr. Park. People who cannot maintain professionalism and care for other people should not be in this field. This exact behavior is what drives people away from care that can save their lives. To laugh and smile in your patients faces while actively causing them distress isn't just unprofessional but absolutely despicable behavior from someone who took an oath to aid those in need.

It is absolutely shameful that this man has a medical license. Hopefully this is rectified soon, but until it is I highly recommend you seek care anywhere else. If you don't want to hear it from these reviews you'll be hearing it from every other patient in the waiting room.|I agree with everyone who has mentioned communication as being very poor. They won't even allow reply's to emails making communication nearly impossible. The doctors also push everyone to get nerve blocks and then overbook the procedures. I waited more than 2-hours past my appointment time in a cramped waiting room made for 10 people, but had 30 plus people plus overflow outside in the heat. I finally gave up.  Save your self pain and frustrations and go anywhere else.|Everyone was great! The problem is my 86 yr old grandfather was seen for the 1st time. Had a problem with prescription. Called over 5 times left messages and call back number. Have not received a call back to fix this problem. He's in a great deal of pain and is wheelchair bound. No body should have to go through this. All we need is a call back to fix this issue.|Ty front desk person is awesome she remembers my name seeing me only a few times.
Maria medical assistant very nice and professional
Jason Doctor so down to earth. He listens to my complaints and also non complaints ( I talk a lot)
Very very nice clinic. I'm 69 yrs old and the previous places I've been to make me feel like a drug addict but they understand my Medicaid problems resulting from chronic pain.?If I could give them 10 stars I would do it.
Thank you Pain Center of Arizona

Ver|Dr Curletta is so caring and compassionate. He spent so much time with me and helped me finally get some answers on why I have chronic pain. He answered all my questions and helped me get a treatment plan to get out of pain. Thank you Dr Curletta you are amazing!|I'm bringing my mom today, but I'm a patient of Dr. Curlettas as well. He is joining their practice which can often be hectic. I've had to call several times and Ty has been nothing but very helpful and patient through this whole transition.  Some would often lose patience but she continues to smile and make us feel welcome and heard.  Thank you Ty|In the last year, I noticed the practice (Chandler) go through some changes.  A big red flag to seek out another clinic was the high turnover of practitioners. Another flag was hearing the staff complain about the company. I initially ignored it because sometimes workers have bad days and just need to vent.  But the last 6 months, my experience with The Pain Center was eye-opening.  Frustration with miscommunication. Multiple appointments needing to be rescheduled (requested by the clinic, not me).  New providers wanting to add things to my plan of care that were discussed/decided on by the previous provider.  And don't bother calling after-hours because the on-call provider will tell you to go to the ER rather than listening to the actual problem/issue or make an effort to help resolve it.  Patient Relations representative was so unprofessional.  The rep made a comment about ""I don't know why she (a previous employee) gave you my information...should have handled it herself"".  Really?  I mean, you might feel that but you don't SAY it to the patient. My last interaction left me feeling like I was just a drug seeker looking to get my next fix.  I was so relieved when my insurance decided to discontinue their contract with The Pain Center. Now I just have to wait weeks for my records to be sent to a new office.",2024-12-11|2024-07-17|2024-06-18|2023-07-25|2023-05-24|2024-02-01|2023-10-18|2022-01-24,4|1|1|2|5|5|5|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,short_wait_times|long_wait_times|insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJFXmn3cMBK4cRGGxQ5Ohr5Q4,42

The Doctor performed an MUA (Manipulation Under Anesthesia). I no longer had the ability to lift either shoulder, i.e. can put on clothing and the rest of the impacts to my life.

I had consulted with 4 Orthopedic Surgeons, the Mayo Clinic.. and had received the following options....

1. Wait 18 months to Two years and it will hopefully heal itself...
2. Inject the joint capsule with fluid and it will break it up.   When asking the physicians the follow up question... ok you inject the fluid wound it go to the point of least resistance and exit at the one point... they had no answers.
3. Do an MUA

We did the MUA surgery, it was the B E S T choice that we could have made, I had full range of motion in both arms after the surgery, one year later I still have the same range of motion.

So now that we have talked about the why and the results, let's talk about the experience and the Dr and team.

The procedure is simple, they put you under and adjust the area.  Had two Dr's and Anastesiologist.  The procedure takes about 15 minutes it is out patient and you will like and surgery have pain after.

Dr. Quackenbush was the Dr and not only is it his passion the improvement in my lif e that he was able to give me I can't say enough about.  He is AMAZING.  Great bedside manner and really really cares about you.

If you have frozen joints limited mobility, for your sake give them a call and see what they can do to make your life better..|The staff was very friendly and  professional, I enjoyed my visits, I would recommend this location for their services!!",2021-01-13|2020-08-04,5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,surgery_services|physical_therapy|pain_management_services|injection_treatments|experienced_doctors|friendly_staff|efficient_service|thorough_care|board_certified_physicians|multiple_locations,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ2T45Vuw_K4cR8hbLvdu4ev4,2

He takes  care of me he rocks. At one point when he left Valley Pain, lies were said about him, I knew it was lies. They would leave it there, and I found him through my primary Dr. I will always have my Dr. Gibbs, he likes my song. Professional *************|I've had a chronic pain problem on the right side of my neck for over two years. Have been to 5 pain management Doctors that didn't help me at all. It was all a waste of time for me until I went and saw a Neurologist and after testing me sent me too Dr. Gibb.
I was thinking that this to might be a waste of time but after meeting with Dr. Gibb I was very impressed with his bedside matter very much. He's young and enjoyed answering my questions in detail. That was a first for me, believe me. He conferred with my Neurologist and decided their plan of action.
My first procedure included 3 nerve blocks and it was over a month after I started feeling less pain. Today I still have pain but not a 10 anymore on the scale. It was nice to have some of my pain gone.
My second procedure was a nerve block to my left hand which had severe carpal tunnel syndrome. Prior to the block the pain and discomfort from the carpal tunnel kept me from sleeping at night even though I wore a brace. I'm happy to report that I'm able to sleep for 6-7 hours a night now.
I would recommend Dr. Gibb to anyone who needs help in relieving their pain. He listens too you and answers all your questions and he's there for you if you have questions later down the road.

Well he made a couple of suggestion and I decided to go with it. My back hasn't fell this good in over 15 years. No pain. I feel really really good!

Dr. Deaver was attentive and had some really good ideas about a plan of treatment for me.   He listened and answered all my questions.

Being a nurse myself, that is all very important to me in an office setting.   I certainly appreciated them all.|I was met with respect and extreme concern for my health.

I feel great and my quality of life is improving. And my pain is little to none Very thankful for a fighting chance.|Dr Deaver did not care at all about me, nor would care to work with my Neurologist to figure out what is best. He just decided that he didn't understand my functional movement disorder with functioning seizures so he wouldn't help me. I mean what happened to the days of doctors trying and caring? Just because you may have to work a little bit harder and communicate with another doctor you just give up? Why even be a doctor if you can't even bother to care about a patient?|I will have to say my recent visits and nerve block shots have helped. Nothing will take away all the pain but the relieve I get from the shots help out tremendously.

But I will leave a review as I had asked them to stop texting me but yet they sent another message with a different number.  My wife had her first appointment yesterday. It did not go well at all. They did not have courtesy to tell us her medical records had not come in yet. She has severe PTSD at doctors' offices from another doctor. Any way she had to wait for hours at the office to be called back then wait some more then to be taken into the office of DR. Deaver. Now Instead of telling her that her medical records had not came in like he should have he had her explain why she was there, just to look at her like she was lying and faking her illness. He even told her he did not believe her that the neurologist agreed she should go to pain management for her condition.  He was cruel to my wife by making her go through the whole thing to then tell her he can't help her. If we would have known her records from her main physician and the neurologist were not in yet we could have had at least two hours to call while we were waiting! We had no idea. And my poor sick wife whom woke up already sick with a migraine and throwing up before we left felt betrayed and mocked by Dr. Deaver. And now she has to wait 3 more excruciating weeks before he will see her again even if he gets her records early. And it takes even longer to find somewhere else so she is stuck with someone who now has a bad opinion of her as she was extremely sick when she went in and she gets emotional plus all the stress they cause her.|Ashley has always been nice to me.

For two years, I was trapped in a relentless cycle of daily vomiting and constant pain. My weight plummeted by 70 pounds due to the incessant vomiting. Despite trying every available medication, including one sourced from Canada, I found no relief. Eventually, I underwent surgery to have a gastric pacemaker implanted, hoping for a reprieve. Sadly, it offered none.

The relentless vomiting and pain persisted, driving me in and out of the hospital. My gastroenterologist eventually told me there was nothing more he could do and referred me to a pain management specialist and for a feeding tube. Initially, I resisted the idea of pain management, fearing daily pain medication. But as my quality of life dwindled, I relented, seeking a way to dull the pain if nothing else.

I walked into my first appointment with Dr. Flaxman, tears streaming down my face, utterly hopeless. At 31, I felt I had lost everything to this disease. I could no longer work or enjoy activities with my daughter. Most days, I was confined to bed. Dr. Flaxman sat with me, not just addressing my physical symptoms, but also acknowledging the emotional toll gastroparesis had taken on me. She listened as I shared my frustration with the four GI doctors who had declared there was nothing more to be done. She didn't promise a cure but offered hope for a 50% improvement. Skeptical yet desperate, I trusted her and her compassionate staff. After that appointment, I called my husband from the car and cried, feeling hope for the first time in two years.

Over the past year, I've undergone hypogastric plexus injections in my back with Dr. Flaxman. It took months, but my symptoms have improved by at LEAST 50% without relying on pain medication. Not just the pain, but the vomiting has significantly slowed down. Though I still have difficult days, I'm slowly reclaiming my life. Thanks to Dr. Flaxman and her team, my daughter is getting her mother back, my husband his wife back, and I'm regaining my quality of life. Our lives have transformed for the better.

While I may never be completely cured, Dr. Flaxman has helped me more than any GI doctor or surgeon. I avoided the feeding tube thanks to the injections. Would I recommend Natural State Pain and Wellness? Absolutely. Every person in that office is dedicated to going above and beyond to help. From Gayla at the reception, always greeting me with a warm smile and genuine concern, to Kerry and Gayle in the procedure room, ensuring my comfort and well-being, everyone there feels like a lifesaver.

Thank you, Dr. Flaxman, for giving me my life back and supporting me through the darkest times. My family and myself are forever grateful to you and your incredible staff. Much love to you all.|Dr. Flaxman was phenomenal! Her staff was very welcoming from the moment I entered the clinic. They ensured they answered all my questions, and my examination was thorough.

Highly recommend going to see them if you're in Little Rock! You will not be disappointed!|My young adult son went to this clinic for chronic pain he has had (post operative) for 6-7 years.  To say I am impressed with this ENTIRE group of medical professionals is a MAJOR understatement!  They helped relieve his pain but also gave him hope!  They didn't just care for his body but also his heart, his soul, and his spirit.  The compassion, skill, humility, and knowledge they displayed has changed my son's life and mine as well.

I am on disability and been trying to get a back surgery (fusion) for over a year now with them. All I want to do is lead a normal life not on medication consistently, be able to go back to work, and be more active with my kids. They sent me to a specialist who didn't want to touch me right now due to the nature of my situation. Come back, they offer si joint fusion, I agreed as long as it wouldnt pose issue to other affected areas. Had to do procedures to appease the insurance and then they never scheduled the surgery.. I rarely see the main doc, mainly the aprn's is what I see and I ask consistently about the surgery offered and get the same damn answer the judge says ""but you're so young and healthy"" if that were true, I would not be coming there and would not be stuck on a pain medication I do not even want but have to fight for because they keep putting the dates off further and further and insurance won't let me have it. Tired of being pushed away with a pain medication that doesn't allow me to function normal or be an active participant in society. Tired of condescendingly being told I'm so young and healthy when I'm walking around missing a disc in my back, bone on bone, with si joint and hip problems. Can't even get in for procedures to help with the pain even though I complain of it EVERY TIME I GO. They just give me another appointment card and refill and send me out the door without acknowledging anything.

I had some horrible pain about 2 months after extensive neck surgery. (4 plates and 8 screws) the pain got so bad I was having issues sleeping and it was effecting my daily life. He did injections in the muscle down my neck, shoulder and  back. About 2 days later the pain improved dramatically. I am over 2 months and the pain is still better. I'm not saying I never have pain but now I know it's muscular, I can take a muscle relaxer and use a heating pad if it flares up. I have more good days than bad!  He also did the injections that day, all in one visit. He took his time with my visit, explained everything and answered my questions.|After trying several pain treatment clinics,  I was really not looking forward to this visit. After being scrutinized,  looked at suspiciously, distrusted,  and treated like I was a drug addict before I was even given a chance, was just plain old nerve wracking.  After giving up and excepting my fate a year earlier, and my quality of life being nonexistent,  I knew I had to try again for my family.  And I'm so glad I did.

Dr. Malki and his team are the most compassionate  I've encountered since the day of older doctors. You know, the ones whom truly cared
about their patients. If you put in the work along side of Dr Malki and his crew, you become a team.

I'm satisfied. Aamof, I want Dr.  Hunt to take over the chiropractic part of my treatment as well. The receptionist could use a few lessons in courteous customer service.

Once arriving to their office, I was told that I would have to submit to blood and urine tests BEFORE even seeing the physician.  I have never experienced this before and I declined. They need to make this known to their patients before making them wait so long. Three months of pain, waiting to see a doctor for an initial office visit for nothing.  I made this appointment for a procedure, not to get drugs.

After owner response; I repeat, I was not there to get drugs. If I would have gotten to see a doctor I could have told him that.  This ""practice"" of having new patients submit to urine and blood test before even seeing a doctor makes absolutely no sense. Patient and doctor should meet and come up with a treatment plan.

She came home in disarray, crying and upset . Spoke with someone via text about the situation, and got a text saying she's discharged because of a threat to the receptionist, my wife and I have a paid lawyer and video of the entire argument and a lobby full of witnesses, she was humiliated, hurt and embarrassed and we will contact attorney for this matter to be resolved so it won't happen to anyone else.|I really like Dr. Hunt and his staff.They are very patience with you....and they are really concerned about your well being. They take the time to see how your feeling and how the medication is working for you. I really like the North Little Rock location...and you don't have to stay long in the waiting room either.They see you really quick...and the waiting room do not be crowded. I like the whole staff..There are all very friendly and show compassion...They are the best PTCOA..I ever went too.",2024-11-08|2025-02-01|2024-12-04|2022-08-19|2024-02-03|2024-01-21|2024-05-22|2023-08-04,5|1|2|5|5|4|1|5,,,"1 p.m.|12 p.m.|11 a.m.",70.25|66.75|65.25,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJE0R0Eo--0ocR7KrC2GWNtRM,282

Everyone treated me with kindness and respect. They listen to what's going on with you and then starts finding different types of treatment tailored to me and my situation. I couldn't have asked for a better doctor and APN that I've been assigned to. Would definitely recommend to others|I usually go to Mercy, but opted for this place due to quicker appointment availability--big mistake. Every visit, I saw a different physician's assistant. When I finally got a surgeon's appointment, it was a video visit with a rude, condescending surgeon who dismissed my concerns and said I'd ""have pain until you die."" The disorganization was staggering; no online balance info, and phone calls led to constant transfers. After a procedure worsened my back pain, I refused a follow-up with the same surgeon and never heard back. Dr. Amini and Dr. Calhoun are great, but they don't make up for the rest of the experience. Go here at your own risk. I'm back at Mercy, where I'm treated with respect and have a clear plan of action. I also agree with other negative reviews about unnecessary drug tests.|To Dana Fryman- my husband Andy was in your office and saw you yesterday. You took time to actually review his records and asked him about the cyst on his kidney found 2 years ago!! We didn't know anything about this test result as we do
Not have a portal and Andy has dementia. We now have a Drs appt scheduled to see our General Practitioner Monday. We are so thankful for your thoroughness and kindness and hope Andy will be able to see you at his following appointments. Thank you for allowing us to be alerted of this issue . God bless you. Jean Marshall-Wife|I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I was there 3 different times wanting to get injections in my neck. Saw 3 different doctors they lost my 1st intake papers 2nd Dr wrote script for my MRI come back the 3rd time of course no MRI there to read. They pad their pockets giving ya drug test even though they haven't wrote a prescription for narcotics and you haven't ask for any narcotics and don't want um and they wanted me to go to medical records and get my MRI results for them ... Like I said would not recommend , definitely not organized... Still no treatment other than 10 weeks of physical therapy then the physical therapist disappeared and left , never seen a Dr office ever run like this in my entire pathetic stupid life ... Steer clear|My last visit was not the one I was expecting. I was expecting to talk to a doctor about my pain in the other problems with pain that I'm having due to my paraplegia I talked to a nurse practitioner Who was very short with me and was not willing to listen to my pain problems and I was asking her why I Wasn't talking to a doctor and she got really upset and then denied me one more pill a month because she didn't see that I was hurting and sent me a message saying we don't believe you need to up your dosage And my question was who are we? Isn't the doctor supposed to make that decision?|Dr. Hunt, and the staff at the Pain Treatment Center of America have been very helpful in trying to get me the best pain relief. The one negative thing about the clinic is the inconsistencies in who the provider will be. I know it's hard for the doctors to have to travel to NW AR for a day, but when you build a rapport with a doctor, you should still have access to that doctor, even if it's by a televisit. I'm hoping this is an issue that will be resolved quickly.|Dr Hunt was and is an amazing Dr. I have not felt good Dr. bedside manner in a very long time and that's why I haven't saw treatment until now and I was completely taken back by his bedside manner. He has made me feel like he cares about my treatment plan and he began ordering an MRI right away.!!
I am extremely blessed to have been referred to The pain treatment centers of America in Bentonville!
I would highly recommend anyone struggling with pain to reach out to this clinic!!!!

I was on guard when I witnessed two patients on two different occasions yelling at the receptionist about changing their apt without telling them. Then I found out how that happens. YOU DO NOT PICK YOUR APT DAY/TIME. They give it to you and you just accept it or tough luck.
They first collect your money BOTH COPAY AND coinsurance. So bring the checkbook. Then they hustle you back - oh not to be seen but for a urine drug screen whether relevant or NOT! Invasion of privacy! No consent! They delve into very private areas when you're only there to discuss an epidural because you have scoliosis. REALLY!! Unscrupulous to say the least.

I saw my PC and he sent me to Baptist Rehabilitation. Three months of stretching and working it out and my back was getting worse. My PC sent me to Prestige Spine and received 3 injections into my spine. This gave me a little relief for about three days. A friend came by my house and saw the pain I was in and recommended Dr. Alaya. I set up the surgery and the difference was felt as I walked out the door. Sore from the staples in my back but a noticeable difference in how I could walk like a normal person. It has been six weeks and I am teaching tennis again. I get sore after four straight hours but the difference is amazing. I have been teaching tennis for forty six years and thought I was done. I'm back and starting to feel like my old self.

The persons who posted people are addicts by choice is uneducated in the crisis!. When an elder, a disabled person as well as others who may sadly be Afflicted. With pain daily, does NOT make them an addicts! Etsvtry to learn & not throw riccks, when uts obvious you are not informed.  SMH|When Dr Ahmad was here as a Physician the service and treatment programs was more than satisfactory. He truly understood that a person in my line of work and with my injuries needed help controlling my pain. He worked with several different meds to control and relieve pain to a tolerant level.
Now that there has been interim physicians and practitioners the service has began to slip to less than satisfactory level.  And it's primarily the office manager or whatever his title is.  He is rude to say the least and uncaring and just not a good person to be greeting patients that are already in pain and doesn't respond well to sarcasm and harsh words.
Not every person that is seen at a pain Clinic is a drug seeker. Many are like myself and just trying to get enough relief that we can make it through the work day and help someone else in the process. I have been a paramedic for almost 12 years and an EMT for 19 yrs so it's very common for me to have to go out on a call and help lift someone that weighs twice my size. And some of the calls requires a great deal of stress on the body.
The strict laws have made it difficult to get prescriptions from our PCP's and forced us to rely on ""Pain Clinics"" and now the laws are trying to limit the help we are able to get from the Pain Specialist.  Does the government want us on disability and unable to care for ourselves. There is many a day that it takes all I can muster up to get out of bed and go about my day and get to work to help others who probably feel much better than I do at any given moment. Even with my treatment regimen that the government says should treat my pain ailment. They don't take in to account that my injuries and the pain from them has been increasing since 1985.
I sincerely hope that Dr Ahmad returns to UPC as I am seeking another facility to provide treatment in the near future if this deterioration persists.|My first visit to Dr. Ahmad at United Pain Care, was 10 September, 2015. I printed out the paperwork from their website and had it filled out to save myself some time. I arrived 15 minutes early and was told the Doctor hadn't arrived yet and the wait was about an hour, which it was. The waiting room had about 12-15 people in it. After getting checked in, I waited in the waiting room about an hour and was called back to the nurses station, where my BP was taken, my height and weight was recorded ( I was only asked for it, not actually weighed) then given a cup to pee in and told where to put it when done. I sat outside her office for about 10 minutes, then Dr. Ahmad called me into what I thought was an exam room, but it turned out to be his office, where another young lady also had a desk. He looked at my paperwork, asked me a few questions like where my pain was, how long I had this pain, etc., even though all this information was on the paperwork he had in front of him. He then asked me how long it had been since my last pain medication, I told him, he said he was only able to prescribe a maximum of 3 pills a day, which I said was fine since that was what I had been taking, then a machine spit out my prescription and I was told to go to the front desk to get my appointment for the next month. All in all, not a bad experience, but no hands on exam or anything like that. So, to recap, this pain clinic is like a cattle call with no real exam by the doctor and no real consultation of any type, just get your prescription and come back next month. I gave it 4 stars for the ease in getting my prescription but not 5 stars since I had no real consultation with the doctor.|When Dr. Ahmad was here at the clinic, it was slow progress to get in to see him, but you felt like he knew you. He put you on meds that helped with your multiple conditions. After Dr. Ahmad lost his license, the staff was in constant flux-- including the doctors. You never knew who you would see when the door opened!
I liked Dr. Ahmad. He was no pill mill doctor, as he was made to appear. He was trying to help us with our pain. If people are addicted to opioids, it is nobody's fault but their own. You can control how you take them. You can learn how to function with pain, and block some out.
Now, it seems that Dr. Shajaat has become our regular physician.
Dr. Shajaat is a very good, and caring physician. The longer I get to know him, the more I like him. He smiles, has a little small talk with you. He is young. Hopefully, he will be with us for years.
If you like to be treated like a child by the 'Office 'Manager' then you are in luck! Because Kash, who is at the front desk, is rude. He always manages to make you feel like you are holding up every one from seeing the doctor!
Having been an Administrative Assistant, as well as worked in a a few medical offices,  I know the job. I also know that you don't treat the clients/patients as problems. No matter how bad you feel or they act. AS A PROFESSIONAL, you never speak to them rudely, or take out your misery at having a job you obviously hate!! Without US IN THAT WAITING ROOM, the doctors would have NO need for you or your attitude.
The young man who does the labs, urine test cup--which by the way, you will now do EACH MONTH WHEN YOU VISIT!--(used to be 3-4 months), weight, BP, pulse Ox, is named Dill. He is nicer than Kash, but has begun to pick up his 'rush-rush, hurry-hurry' babel.
There is no ""exam"". No touching of the patient's body by the doctor at all. Never has been. I imagine that Dr. Shajaat will do the same.
But that just means that my painful, deteriorating spine, is not being monitored by MRIs, X rays, eyeballs, palpation, or any other means. This is very concerning to me. It adds to the depression, as you have signed a contract to not seek pain care from another physician, but the one whom you are seeing is not going to look at your aching body parts.
Be sure to arrive early or close to on time. It doesn't mean that you will be seen then--- it is after all, a waiting room----, but ""Office Manager"" Kash, will be more than happy to exercise his authority and penalize you by either fining you $25 or $50, depending upon how late you are!
You can expect to spend about 2.5 to 3 hours in the office, in one or the other of the two waiting rooms. But you won't be alone!  The front waiting area is usual filled with other desperate people who are also in as much pain as you are.
I wish that every DEA agent, official and all the rest that don't suffer from chronic, never ending pain, had to experience the same pains that all of us suffer daily with, and suffer for months with it.
They need to realize that if we could,  throw away the canes, braces, pills--all of it--we would! We'd love to go back to work! We're not here to get a 'fix'! We can scarcely get our prescription filled for all the rules now! A lot of us need help to get out of bed every day and we don't take them illegally!|I love the the staff they take time do not just medicate but other things like back braces and annoy other braces such as knee and back.

So kind and caring of all his patients. I thank God that I was referred to Dr. P I couldn't have asked for better.|One of the most thorough doctors i have ever met. He actually listens to his patients. Dr Prasad is THE BEST!!|Dr. Prasad, you're awesome, so compassionate, and you have such a big heart. Chris and Ashley are amazing, and they do their job well and I would give all of you a 10. They also treat your patients with dignity, respect, & compassion. But Eli is very rude & disrespectful & far from compassionate. You know that I've always got along with your staff until now. He hung up on me twice right in the middle of my sentence, he told me that he was working on the letter for my surgeon for 2 weeks and after calling several times to get that letter and hearing his promises of working on it, his 1st excuse was because he was thrown into the middle of chaos, then he tries to tell me that they aren't allowed to give me any pain meds!? and lastly, he tells me that my surgeon's office needs to call him and then when they first called, he wouldn't answer the phone!? When Ashley was in the middle of scheduling my next appointment, he called her into his ""office"" to teach him how to do something as if I weren't standing there discussing a date for me to come back and that was very unprofessional. If he hangs up on your patients like he did me, or picks up the phone and never answers but immediately puts you on hold, talks down to them like he did me, as if he is better than others, you are going to lose more patients than just me.
I honestly don't know why you didn't offer Chris or Ashley that position because it seems like Eli's position has gone to his head. I was an office manager for a few years and I would have been fired if I did all of that, but then again, I would never treat people the way he did me. He didn't bother to tell you the TRUTH about why I was having to call over & over again. I'm not sure what he told you but of course I'm going to keep calling when I get upset because he hung up on me or he is not doing what he promised.  He is also making the rules as he goes along because he was telling me that the surgeon can't give me a stronger pain med after surgery but I looked it up and called a pharmacist and that is not the law and it wasn't a problem with your office sending a letter over for the 2 surgeries I had before this one and they were able to give me the appropriate amount needed according to what they had to do, & sadly, this is by far the worst painful surgery out of them all but now all of the sudden, Eli's law says that they are not allowed to give me anything. It breaks my heart to leave but I will not be treated that way when I am a paying customer. And it's really sad that I, the patient, humbled myself & apologized for reacting the way I did on Monday when he was so rude and his response was, ""oh well, we have our days"" but he never acknowledged nor apologized for the way he was treating me.
I will miss the 3 of you and your kindness. Thank you for taking care of me all of this time, you really did an awesome job.|The best pain doctor ever. This man is always willing to help you, he's kind, compassionate and does a super great job.

The appointment remained in  pending status in the Conway regional portal. Very poor staff and customer service.|My review is really second hand. I haven't been treated here but my wife has. She sees a pain management specialist. So far she's been very pleased with the care she's received. In fact, she would rather drive 30 minutes to get here than go to the local hospital in Russellville.

He relieved pain with a new procedure I agreed to let him do and I had had pain for nearly six years. It was unbelievable  BUT apparently alot can change in two years. Can you believe that I have been laying in a bed for two weeks after a horrible fall and I have called his nurse sent emails with not one response. I cannot use my tight legs due to the fire burn felling that shocks me if I attempt to bare weight. Today I spoke to someone at the front desk and I was ceting and begging for her to please help me I had my referral from the er. Can you believe this hateful insensitive young lady attempted to inform me that because I was disappointed ^DISCHARGED"" from that office I could NEVER see abt of their Doctors. My heart fell to the floor and I felt like she was lying I had done something wrong and put that on my permanent medical records.....oh no wait a min. I called her right back and I said young lady hear ne out please. Every conway regional dr abruptly stopped seeing United Health Care patients due to a conflict between conway|It sucks to down-rate this clinic because I really enjoyed the short time I worked with Dr. Ranahan and his team. I felt that he genuinely listened to my problems and they all took very good care of me when I came in in January 2021 to receive pain shots for my DDD. The issue now is that I have to transfer to a different clinic because of a billing mistake by the clinic that hasn't been fixed. The clinic never submitted my 2021 procedure to my insurance and instead sent me a bill for the whole amount remaining. When I contacted them about getting this fixed, they said they would address it with billing and get back to me. That was six months ago. At this point I have shown up in person and called and left messages and cannot get a response from them about what is being done to fix this issue. I'm more than ready to pay my dues for the procedure, but I expect everything to be submitted properly to my insurance first. All in all, the medical side of the clinic is great, but the administrative side has caused me a lot of stress. I'll be transferring to a different clinic because I can no longer wait on another treatment for my pain, but I hate that it didn't work out with this clinic.|I have been a patient of Dr Mccarver's for about 2 years. I need a double hip replacement and have pretty severe stenosis in my spine. The pain is often unbearable. I am treated well and my pain is mostly controlled. I believe the doctors here try to balance controlling your pain and keeping you from becoming addicted to the medication. My doctor listens and doesn't mind sticking around to make sure you understand what going on. I'm only giving 4 stars because early on in my treatment, the nurse failed to return my calls. That's a situation that resolved itself and anytime I call, it may take all day, but they do eventually call me back. It's a busy clinic so I understand|I don't understand the negative reviews at all. I've been seeing Dr. McCarver for about half a year now? and man, this is the first time someone has actually worked with me to find answers. He also listens and provides solutions to every issue I have, doesn't just pick and choose. I always have the best experience here with him and his staff. They're so down to earth and genuine, I actually look forward to the appointments like it's a breath of fresh air. They even made some pretty painful injection appointments way less scary by just simply hanging out with me and calming me down while I was panicking. Trust me, you won't regret coming here! Thank you Dr. McCarver for all you've done! For the first time in 10 years I feel optimistic and confident that I have a plan to tackle my chronic pain.|I was a patient of Dr. McCarver's . I had no problems with him, but the staff was deplorable. Twice I was given an appointment for a cervical ablation with sedation, which they only do once a month. Both times I never got on the books. The second time was after a failed attempt in the office. The pain was so severe I could not stand it so the doctor promised they would work me in for sedation at the hospital. Never happened and the staff could not have cared less. I've had eight major orthopedic surgeries in the last 19 years giving me a great deal of experience with doctors and staff.

Staff here are rude and demeaning. You can NEVER talk to anyone when you call. I've communicated more with them by text than over the phone. They never followed up on anything. I've already contacted several former patients because of the things I've heard.  A 74 year old patient from there had a bad fall once with a brain bleed and they weren't getting relief to the lower back(hit in the lower back from behind by heavy equipment when they fell and hit their head). They told this person, over text, they don't treat acute pain and that they need to go see PCP.(Patient still has the text too!)  Well they did go see the PCP after a stay in ICU, and had PCP contact them to okay the extra meds. The next appointment they were chastised and talked down to horribly and denied telling patient that. Then REDUCED the patient's meds. Then got a letter in the mail terminating the contract. They couldn't have told them at the appointment? The letter also stated patient can't set foot within 100 feet of establishment... A 74 yr old patient who can barely walk. This place is a joke. After the first visit you may not see the doctor again for months. I hope they understand they're messing with someone's way of life, and quality of life.

He was trying to make me feel like I have something wrong.   And I asked him to check again.   He began to speak to me in a very rude way.   I again asked him not to speak to me in this manner.  He then threatened to call the police on me if I said anything else.( he was the only one yelling ).   All I asked this unprofessional to do was watch the tone he had with me. I even asked the nurse is he always like this. She seemed so shocked and upset that he was speaking to me in this manner   Wow.         I should have followed my first mind and canceled this appointment.     When I walked into the place I knew I did not belong there based off the energy.  And when I walked into the room.  I felt it even more. And now I see why.  No matter the reason. He should have been professional. And was not.    I would not recommend this place to anyone not even your dog.

They asked me if I've had any surgeries or been to er which I stated I had surgery the day prior. They cancelled my appointment without properly notifying me. No calls or nothing just cut me loose after 6 yrs of being a pt there. Now I'm having to protect my reputation n find another pain doctor.

Dr. Worku thank you very muc. Hope to be your patient next year if not sooner.or|Dr. Worku is very caring of her nurses and her patients. She and I have a good repore. As a matter of fact, I had a low blood sugar yesterday and drove off before I could ask her about anything (I have about 6 things I want to ask her). She has agreed to call me personally tomorrow to discuss those things. I don't know of many Drs who do that.|Ok, Dr Worku is great, very competent, very compassionate. But whoever is over the finances leaves something to be desired. I didn't appreciate her getting rude with me when I was just trying to explain my situation. She was going to tell the Dr ""everything"", like she's going to tattle on me.T hen, when we got everything situated, she was all sing songy. I'm not a dog, treat me with a little respect.|Dr. Worku is AMAZING! My dad has been suffering with neck pain for years following a MVA in the 80's and thought he would have to suffer forever. She didn't just order pain meds and send him home. She is trying to find a solution to the pain as well as treating his active pain. I can feel how compassionate she is with her patients and can tell she truly cares. All of the staff there are so sweet, nonjudgmental, and helpful! We have the best pain management doctor right here in southeast Arkansas! I highly highly recommend Dr. Worku and her sweet nurses and staff.|I've suffered for years with my back and thought I would have to live with the pain, then I met Dr Worku. She is a God send. She really cares about her patients. She preformed a nerve burning procedure on my back right in her office, I got relief from my pain within 24 hrs of having it done, and it lasted for 11 months. The nerve burning procedure can be repeated. For years I was terrified that I would have to have back surgery but after I started seeing Dr Worku my fears are gone. I can't praise her enough for what she has done for me. I would highly recommend her to anyone suffering from chronic pain.|This place has changed my life in more ways than I can even begin to describe. I came to Dr. Worku for answers and a solution to my on going issue with severe pain. I had been dealing with this pain for 8 months. From issues with stability to not being able to sleep. I had almost come to the conclusion that this would be my outcome after a knee replacement. Dr. Worku showed me that there was a solution after all. I am very greatful to have walked into this wonderful clinic. I want to say thank you to Dr. Worku and her amazing staff for the care I have received. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone unable to get their pain under control.|I would like to say comprehensive pain care is one of the best places to go they are professionals very clean the staff is awesome and friendly they have worked with me there the best the staff cares about you I would like to take the time I've never had such a awesome Dr. Nadia Worku and I would like to say Casey Rader there both are awesome they treat you like your not just a person with a illness they are carrying and would go out of there way to make feel cared for Thanks Merry Christmas ladies y'all are no 1 in healthcare Melinda Thurlkill|Dr Worku is a very caring and understanding person that listens when you try to explain all the things that you have going on.

He is fabulous|Doctor and entire staff are all very heartless, cold and rude! They treat you like you are just money to them. They DO NOT care if you are in pain. Don't be fooled. Please hear me, please go to a doctor that actually cares about their patients. There are 2 male and 2 female here and all 4 of them are all the most self centered, self righteous narcissistic bunch of people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing. Have you ever hated someone so much that you wish you could go back in time before you met them? But, you can't, so now you feel disgusted at the very thought of ever had to know them. That's how being here made me feel.I don't ever want to see these people again as long as I live!!!|Best Dr ever!  He actually cares about your pain and wants to do everything he can to get you back to a more normalized state.  It's hard to find a Dr that listens to the patient.|Finding Dr. Olaya has been life-changing for me. Not only did he save my life, but he has drastically improved my quality of life in ways I never thought possible. From the moment I met him, I could tell that he genuinely cared about me and my well-being. He took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all of my questions in a way that was easy to understand.

Under his care, I have seen a tremendous improvement in my health that cannot be underestimated. His knowledge, expertise, and dedication have made all the difference in my recovery. I now have more energy, less pain, and feel like I am in the best health I've been in years - all thanks to him.

I cannot recommend Dr. Olaya enough. He is a true professional, and his compassionate approach to patient care is truly exceptional. If you are looking for a doctor who can and will help you, I strongly encourage you to give him a try. He changed my life for the better, and I am confident he can do the same for you.|One of the best doctors I've ever had. He's patient and listens to what you have to say.

so  UPDATE...  The crew at Malvern Avenue    are GREAT!!!  They worked NONE stop to help with any and all issues that I had come up during my procedures and after as well.

HOWEVER   the crew at Mercy Lane are quite the opposite.  EVERY SINGLE TIME  I decide I need to speak to someone,  I spend at least an hour trying to get in touch with someone, anyone that will help me.
I have been trying to pay a bill for about an hour today, dropped calls...rude people, saying hang on a minute..... then dropped calls...   You have to pay your bill at such and such number.... NOPE  that wasn't correct.... IT IS BEYOND AGGRAVATING !!!    I have actually spoke to them about correcting this dropping calls,  STILL NOT FIXED           Too bad you have to go thru all of this while in pain or not .... to pay a bill....|This clinic and the Chi office is great!

Incredibly rude and hateful in every interaction. She will call you names for simply asking questions about how things work. DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you enjoy being treated like a bug. I have been in pain management for seven years and I've never been so appalled by the way patients are handled.|Tested positive on urine test, got threatened and yelled at then next appointment I brought it up, once again stating I had taken nothing that would cause me to fail a test. The doctor shrugged, said, ""it's OK, the followup test was negative, so the first test was a false positive. No apology. No professionalsim!|I have been in pain management for 11years now. I see Dr. Gaines who is great at what he does. Most of the office staff are friendly and kind as well. I do have reserved feelings about 1 whom is not very friendly and seems to be a little harsh, however, with that said, this office is very busy so getting things done in a quick manner is a must. A smile and a please and thank you is a great customer service skill however and goes a very long way when dealing with patients. Otherwise, the office is clean, office staff are great. Dr Gaines listens and answers any questions I have.|My husband suffered a back injury in 1988 and was advised it would get worse over time. He tries hard to bear the pain and go about his day. Over the years, he's had to change pain management clinics several times for various reasons. He's seen a vast difference between each clinic. Optimal Pain and Wellness has far exceeded our expectations!! The staff have always been kind and treated us with the utmost respect. Dr Gaines takes time with us and listens to our concerns! He works with us as a team to ensure my husband is as comfortable and functional as possible! Thank you for treating us with respect and not as drug seekers! It truly makes a difference in my husband's quality of life!

We absolutely love the new office!|The Van Buren has hired a new APN and he fired my mother today. She's been with Dr. Gaines for about 8 years. She struggles so much with pain and there isn't a lot she can take for pain because she's in end stage kidney failure on dialysis. She has severe RA, degenerative disc disease and a hip she's waiting to have surgery to be replaced (she's not physically strong enough for the surgery right now). She has never been seen by this nurse practitioner and he has NO CLUE about her history!!! He accused her of selling them and was downright rude! She had a bad fall that landed her in the hospital off and on for three weeks in Late July early August she told him upfront that she had taken some extra because the pain was excruciating. The hospital doctor told her to alternate with ibuprofen, she can't take ibuprofen because of her kidney function. I would recommend staying away from this pain clinic if this is the way the new APN is going to run the practice. My mother is an honest woman with a lot of pain. She's not some young person or even middle aged person trying to work the system. I'm not one to give a totally negative review, but this is just wrong! Dr. Gaines is wonderful and is very kind, but my mother rarely has an appointment with him. Again this review is for the new APN at the VB office.|I have so much anxiety when it comes to pain management and Doctors in general. From the front desk to the Doctor I was treated with the upmost kindness, compassion, and understanding. I was not made to feel like some drug seeking lunatic scratching at the door like 95% of other pain management practitioners do. Dr Gaines is amazing and so are the staff.|I did like going here only when I saw Dr. Gaines. He is a great pain doctor. The new APN is not good, he's rude and doesn't know anything about you but still has the audacity to try to tell you about you and he doesn't listen when you try to explain anything to him. They need the one they had before. The new one fired me and that's fine, because if I can't see Dr. Gaines then I would rather go somewhere else. I give Dr. Gaines 5 stars, but the APN gets zero stars!!!! I also like the ladies/nurses that are there because they are very nice. Thank y'all for being so nice and sweet to me. I give y'all 5 stars as well.|I have been a patient with Dr. Daut for close to two years. She has been wonderful in helping me with my pain management program. I especially like her RN Amber. Amber is very responsive and helpful.

Yes, this office has longer wait times, a front staff that does not make small talk, but the lady who checks you out and calendars your next appointment is delightful.

Be absolutely sure to follow all the rules. And tell the nurse and the doctor everything you need them to know. It is so important to have anything out of the ordinary DOCUMENTED in your file. Without it, you could be dropped.

And when he went back for his apt the NP asked him why he missed his last apt and he told her he didn't he went and the dr had an emergency and he had been out of medication the whole time.

I called 2 weeks before having surgery on my arm to have a letter sent to my surgeon so that he could prescribe something stronger because they were doing an osteotomy to shorten my ulnar bone and placing a metal plate in to hold the bone together, which is very painful. I called several times and spoke to Eli, when I could get someone to answer. He promised every time that he would take care of it. I called the day before my surgery and still yet, nothing had been sent over but was promised yet again that he would take care of it.
Thursday morning rolls around & I'm getting ready to go back for surgery & something told me to call and see if Eli had sent the letter over, so l called my surgeons office and they still had not received it. So I called and spoke to Eli once again and he said he apologized but he had been thrown into chaos and was doing his best, I told him that I understood but I had to have that in order for the surgeon to give me anything.
Luckily my surgeon gave me enough for the weekend but I called back first thing Monday morning and spoke to Eli again and now he's going to tell me that the surgeons office needs to call him!?!? Ok & why couldn't he tell me this 2 weeks ago!? I'm not sure what he told Dr. Prasad that I was calling for but I can only assume that he told him I was calling to get drugs and that's far from the truth. I know what I'm given and I've had no issues thus far with my med count ever but I know that he didn't bother to tell the doctor the truth. So I had to go in to be seen today to find out that I now just have to deal with the pain and when I said, how in the heck does he expect me to
rest, Eli says really loud, ""you don't have to cuss at me!"" Ok, so I might slip with a bad word ever so often when I smash a finger or toe but heck is not usually the word that comes out of my mouth. And not only that, but when I was in the office, Ashley asked me what they had to do to my bone, I was explaining it to her and he ""Eli"" had the audacity to tell me he knew what I was talking about, the doctor reset his broken bone without giving him anything, like his was way worse pain than having your ulnar bone cut into and a metal plate being put in!? Well, I'm sure it would hurt to reset a broken bone but l've never heard of anyone having to have that done without any meds. There must have been a reason, if that happened at all. Dr. Prasad has been a really good doctor and I've never given him a reason to be upset with me or see me as being a pest by calling several times but I will not be going back simply because if the doctor believes Eli's lies now, it will probably only get worse. It really looks like Dr. Prasad could have figured out that I've been going there for a long time now and I've never had an issue with anyone there and it just started now with this so called office manager. I hope that Dr. Prasad will soon see that Eli is out to make him look bad with his terrible excuses for not doing his own job. He will only be able to blame Dr. Prasad and the office issues for so long and eventually it will come back on him. I hate that I have really liked everyone there until now and because of that 1 bad apple, he's ruined the way that I see that office now altogether. It's really very sad.
My son-in-law is an orthopedic surgeon that I've recommended them to him & his colleagues for their patients but I will not recommend them any longer nor will I refer anyone else to them simply bc of their new office manager.

This isn't the typical office visit where you sit in the waiting room for 30 minutes and then in the examination room for another 30 just to see the doctor for two minutes.

I have a pain pump, and it has changed my life for the better. I'm even considering going back to school.  I'm very grateful for the treatment I have received.|Today I had another target shot for a pinched nerve at L2. Previously had one at L4. Dr. Mocek is an amazing doctor and an even better man. He truly cares about his patients. Can't recommend him and his staff enough. They are the best!|I had a mostly good experience from them but due to rules I keep having to jump through hoops to be able to keep my meds and it wasn't entirely there fault I ended up leaving both the doctor as it.was physically painful to keep having to go to one thing with them and another with the other doctor  but by far they are a great team I just could not keep up with all the jumping it was wearing me down but they always tried to work with me that and I don't fill they took the falls as serious as they were 3 months after I left I fell and hit my head and got a TBI  I don't blame  them I just wish someone had taken it more seriously there the best in little rock and he tries to work with you  he is an amazing  doctor  and the staff is nice|I absolutely love Dr Mocek and his staff!! He is so nice, caring, and funny. He always puts me at ease and puts a smile on my face. I never feel rushed and he always answers any questions I have. I've had my share of horrible doctors and experiences but Mocek made me feel comfortable the minute I met him. Dana Houston takes care of my pain pump and I love her!!! I have never felt ignored or treated like a number instead of a patient. I will stay with Mocek for as long as he practices!|Dr. Mocek has changed  my husband's life. He is able to do all the things he used to do. He is back mowing our yard. Dr. Mocek is so caring of his patients. We highly recommend him.|I have been nothing but pleased with Dr. Mocek and staff. I recommend Dr. Mocek to everyone that lives with chronic pain. I've been under his care for a few months now and I cannot say enough good things about his quality of service. I experienced a complication during a procedure and Dr. Mocek treated me like I was his actual family. He had a chair brought into the recovery area where I was being monitored and he himself sat in it and watched over me until things stabilized. Dr. Mocek personally maintained contact with my wife through the following day and then his staff was following up daily for the rest of the week.
As long as I have a choice Dr. Mocek will be my number 1 pick. He asks me questions and get this, he actually cares enough about the answers to listen to my response.
Don't pay attention to negative comments, generally they are made by angry unhappy people that were denied something and are therefore lashing out.|My first experience with Dr Mocek was with my father Don Eichler and his back he was in such bad shape. He went out of his way to try to help him have a better quality of life. He also set him up with an additional doctor to go further into finding out what other things could be going on with his condition. What they found out through testing they were able to pinpoint other area's in his heath that were contributing to his condition and his overall health. Between what Dr Mocek found and the other doctor which I feel he teamed with he was able to treat him to make my father's last 3 years of life better and he was able to do more things in his final years.
Why I have told this is my father challenging me as to why I was not going to Dr Mocek. The old saying do as I say not as I do, also even though I'm in my mid fifties I still did what my dad told me. So here's my experience due to other problems I have from stomach issues and allergies to steroid injections I wasn't your regular patient. Where other doctors had just told me sorry there's nothing they could do he didn't give up on me. He is one of a handful of doctor's I believe that truly cares for his patients. He has helped me to have a better quality of life than I thought possible. I often felt I would end up like my father. It has been a process which has taken a good year but I am in such better shape and don't feel like I'm looking at having to have surgery now. He also has done such a great job to make me understand what is going on with my back which for me is great, knowledge is power. I believe he will continue to find new ways to help his patients in the future as well.
Now about his staff I feel they are wonderful from the people at the front desk to the nurses and physician assistants and his staff in the procedure department. You can tell that they care about what  Dr Mocek   is trying to do with his practice to help his patients live better lives. I FEEL HE WANTS HIS PATIENTS TO LIVE THERE LIFE'S AND NOT JUST WATCH IT GO BY.|I have been a patient of Dr. Mocek for about 18 months. I was originally experiencing sciatic nerve pain due to arthritis, scoliosis and disc damage from a fall. I got x-rays and an MRI before any treatment and then I met with Dr. Mocek. He explained and showed me the problem and the procedures which would help my condition and went into detail about how it would work. I agreed to the treatment and began a series of three injections over a four month period and the relief has been great as I have no sciatic nerve pain at all. While dealing with my sciatic problem on my left side for several years, I had abused my right hip and right lower back. I again went to Mocek Spine Clinic and x-rays showed that a nerve in my lower back and hip was being irritated in that joint. I am now getting treatment for that and the relief is fantastic. I would recommend Dr. Mocek and his very professional staff to anyone who is experiencing pain in the spinal area. He has helped me immeasurably.

They came across and very nice and accommodating but they're not.  They don't listen to you when you want to talk.  The np wanted nothing to do with hearing what my husband had to say.  This clinic is all about the money.  They do not care about your pain.  They will even sabotage any chance you have of getting procedure if they don't like you.   They do not care.  You are a dollar sign to them. That's it.|I went to this clinic for severe chronic back pain had all the paperwork sent to them with imaging they decided they wanted to put a steroid shot in my back they put me on Tylenol 4S would not prescribe anything stronger I have failed three times and was in a car accident would not help me with the acute as they would say pain I had to go through my primary physician for something stronger than pain I went there on the 28th for an appointment talk to them about why they wouldn't up the dose why they would not help me with the acute pain and that you know why couldn't they have done something when I called them when I was an emergency room from a car wreck to help me with pain. On September the 2nd they called me and said that they was going to have to fire me as a patient because I was in a car wreck that makes no sense this clinic only wants to do shots in your back so they can charge your insurance more. The Tylenol 4 is like taking a baby aspirin would not recommend this place to anybody|Dr. Slagle appeared to be a good doctor and I had no bad experiences while I was with this clinic.  Then I was involved in a car accident in which another party was liable.  I called to get an appointment to check everything out and was told by Michael (office manager) that I would have to find another clinic, because they do not see patients with pending liability insurance settlements.  I was disappointed but understood their position.  However, this was a huge inconvenience when i had soreness from the accident and was in need of services - and it can take months to get an appointment at another clinic.  Two clinics and 1.5 years later, I called and tried to get back in with Dr. Slagle.  The receptionist would not allow me to talk to the nurse.  She put me on hold and then came back and told me that I can never come back to their clinic - that their policy was to never take a patient who has left there and gone to another clinic.  When I said they left me no choice, and I would like to talk with the nurse - she hung up on me.  I sent a message to them on facebook saying what a good doctor Slagle is, and how disappointed I am in their policies - that I would prefer their clinic over any other.  I did mention the unnecessary rudeness of the receptionist.  About a half hour later I got a call from the nurse saying the doctor did not like my post at all and I should take it down immediately.  She said it was not true - I said which part, that Dr. Slagle is a good doctor?.  When I explained what happened, she said that I was asked to leave due to collections on my account!   This last, even though I have good insurance and paid every procedure in full at the time of service.  After all of this negativity you could not pay me to go back to this clinic.  Since this experience, I have spoken with the Arkansas Association of Neurologists and gotten much needed advice on the pain management specialty.  These are very risky procedures that are being done, and it's important to check out a physician carefully - thank God no permanent damage occurred to my neck before I found this out.  There are only a handful of doctors in Arkansas certified by the American Board of Pain Management, meaning that they have served a year fellowship and formal certification after obtaining their license in neurology.  While a neurologist can legally do the procedures, they are not all properly trained to do them.  None of the doctors in the Hot Springs area are certified in the pain management specialty, including Dr. Slagle.|Dr Slagle changed my life for the better. I could barely get around when he started treating me and now I can physically do pretty much what I want to do. I highly recommend him and his kind and caring staff.|This place is a great place if you need pain management everyone is great friendly and wonderful to do business with|Horrible human being , could care less about people.

I thought the office staff was very nice. Unfortunately, I feel like the actual appointment was rushed, and left me uniformed about the causes of my pain. I was willing to chalk that up to a busy doctor. Not anymore! It's been well over a week since my visit. I still haven't been able to get my medication filled, because they won't take the right steps to do so. I've went out of my way, as well as my insurance company, to make it as easy as possible for them to take care of the issue. On the few rare moment's I spoke to the nurse/(s), they assured me they would take care of it, but they didn't. I had to inform them of what was going on, and that shouldn't be the patient's job. So, over a week after the appointment, I'm left in the same situation I was in beforehand. It's just really annoying they don't have the professional courtesy to at least inform their patients of what's going on, and prove they're actually making, (solving the problem), a priority. Expect to get an answering machine, and don't expect a call back anytime soon. Hopefully this is a fluke thing, and it's resolved soon. Otherwise, I'll be finding another doctor.|I have received great treatment from Optimal Pain and Wellness. I have been treated by Dr Thurman for several years. Now that I have moved, I see Dr Naples.

My name is Michael Mesplay.  I have been in a pain management program since about 2012 in Colorado until 2021, then moved here to Arkansas. My medication history will show I have never abused my medication by any means. It will show I never took more than prescribed, and always took them as prescribed. In 2022 I have some symptoms from high blood pressure that I mistook for being caused by my pain meds. (Oxycodone). I then agreed to stop taking them to see if that was the problem. (I found out later it was high blood pressure causing the symptoms)

Afterwards, I spoke with Dr. Knight, and we discussed plans to help alleviate or at least reduce the pain caused by the procedures themselves in the future. Overall, I was very pleased with how they responded to my concerns and their actions to make future visits go more smoothly.

In an age of ""fast care doctoring"", it is refreshing to experience the focused care that he provides. Right away you'll discover that he truly cares about making you feel better without rushing you out the door. Dr. Nichol will take the necessary time with you to find the optimal treatment path for you. If anyone is seeking management of their chronic pain, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, memory issues, and neurodegenerative diseases, I recommend Dr. Nichol.|Dr. Nichol is an amazing Doctor. I would say the best, and I am not alone in this opinion. I am blown away by his knowledge, compassion, authentic rapport, and results. It has been 7 months  since I was last treated by him and the pain has not returned after many years of suffering. Dr. Nichol changed my life, in that his treatments gave me a peace I had forgotton and seemed unattainable. I am very happy that I was wrong and Dr. Nichol encouraged me to keep going until my painful condition had subsided. This changed my life. I encourage anyone suffering to look into Dr. Nichol and his treatments and begin the healing. Amazing Doctor and recommended highly. Thank you for everything.|Love Dr. Nichol & his assistant Spencer!  They are Compassionate & he cares about my quality of life!   He will take the time to talk you through your treatment plan like no other pain doctor has ever done.  I have been a pain patient off & on for 25 years, I had my 1st of 4 back surgeries when I was 18 yrs old.  In that time I have been to many doctors that have herded me through like I was cattle.  Dr. Nichol is not like that at all.  He takes as long as you need to explain & make sure you understand your treatment plan. Also, if you're not happy with your treatment plan he will work with you to get you on the treatment plan that works.  I am never scared to ask him questions or talk about what my issues are, unlike past doctors I have seen.  He does not judge you like in most pain clinics.  In most clinics, that I have been to, it always felt like I was being treated like I was a criminal.  I have never been treated with more care & empathy by any doctor as I am with Spencer & Dr. Nichol.

Thank y'all so much for helping me get my life back!  I can never express my gratitude enough!!!|Dr. Nichols is an absolute credit to his profession. He listens with great humanity and empathy. This approach allows for chronic pain suffers to have an individualized treatment plan that in my humble opinion allows a better chance at an overall improvement  in quality of life.|I have unfortunately been in contact with many doctors and can honestly say that Dr. Nichol is an exceptional doctor. He is very intelligent and knowledgeable without being arrogant or condescending, which many others are. He is honest without being rude and takes time to listen to any questions or concerns I might have. I am truly blessed to have him as my doctor and would recommend him to anyone who needs a pain specialist!|Dr. Nichol is awesome. He really listened to my specific issues and setup a treatment special to my needs. He was very caring and spent well over an hour of his time consulting with me. I highly recommend him and will be going back myself!|I left this office feeling content because I knew Dr. Nichol listened to me with care and concern.

When he finally got to talk to the Dr. about
His medical issues. The Dr. did not care at all and gave my partner  the same medication, that doesn't not work for his pain. Basically the Dr was also fat shaming him for his pain. Very unprofessional and uncaring for people. Seems like they just care about money more then anything.

I recommend do not go here. Nobody cares at that pain management. Please start caring and show some compassion to everybody. Stop the fat shaming on human beings...|I have been a patient of Dr. Saleem for about a year now. I was in a lot of pain before I saw Dr. Saleem for the first time. He gave me some shots for my lower back pain. It took a few days for those shots to work but after that I was able to sleep through the night without waking up because of pain.

I would give them a zero if it were possible. Beginning with the front desk receptionist. On one occasion she actually began discussing my financial situation in front of an office with several patients. I believe that was violating HIPAA laws. On every occasion in there she was extremely rude. I told the doctor about her and he supported her. I was rather shocked. One day she actually sent me home crying. When I called five weeks later to reschedule for the Little Rock office I was told I'd been fired. No phone call no letter nothing. My primary care doctor had not received anything either. She faxed them as to why I'd been let go and all it said was I'd been let go. I called the office manager who said there was nothing in my file and he would have to talk to Dr Crabtree and get back to me. I never heard back from him either. I was told you are supposed to receive a certified letter when you've been let go. Nothing. It was a horrible experience.|Horrible experience with Dr Ghaleb and his colleagues!  I tried every pain relief method he offered  (including nerve injections) . When I went in for my 1st visit my pcp already had me on hydrocodone 10mg 3 times a day When it no longer helped my pain , I was referred here. He ""adjusted my meds to 5mg hydrocodone without talking to me. I NEVER failed a drug screen in the year I saw him. Finally I was referred to a diagnostic center where I was diagnosed with polyneuropathy which is a nerve disease where nerves in my ankles, feet and legs are dying. I have drop foot because it and excruciating pain along with sensitized sensory overload  (caused by nerve damage) that makes the slightest sounds, touch and lights cause my ears to be extremely sensitive to sound and I get migraines because of light sensitivity. The day I told him the specialist told me to STOP taking injections , he wrote me a script for half of what he adjusted in the 1st place and blatantly LIED to me. He said there was no med in my system but the lab detected METHAMPHETAMINE!  I've never touched that crap in my life! When he gave me the lab results, I of course argued and called him out! He got mad and told me to leave his office and snatched my prescription from my hand and had me escorted out. This office does NOT care about people in real pain with legitimate health issues!  He churns people out the door if you can't take injections which is a $900 visit billed to my insurance rather than the $80 just to give me my dam meds.

Dr Ennis and his team were all so kind and professional! Their office arranged nothing short of a miracle, getting us in quickly to work with my daughter's scheduled surgery date.

Dr Ennis spent time educating us about my daughter's condition and we left the consult feeling informed and supported. He made sure we understood the procedure, the potential for how it could help my daughter, and what he could do in the future (after her surgery) if she needs it.

The day of the procedure we arrived a few minutes early and they got us back immediately. It went by SO quickly and she did great!

After some less than stellar experiences this year, a compassionate, knowledgable doctor and a team so willing to go above and beyond absolutely meant the world to us. They infused such an enormous amount of care into every part of their process- from scheduling, to billing, to the procedure itself. We truly can't sing their praises enough- what a GREAT experience!!

Highly recommend! All the stars!|Impressive!  From the reception staff, to the nursing staff, physician's scribe and Dr. Jason Holt--  They asked and answered pertinent questions, and were the epitome of professional.  Dr. Holt gave me clear concise options to address my dilemma and gave me a plan of action to ascertain a working diagnosis.  I could not be more pleased and am delighted with the quality of care I received today. Thanks to All.|I found Dr. Holt to be very competent. He did an excellent job of explaining exactly what procedure he was going to do, what I could expect from it and how long the results would last. He provided a much more detailed outline of my MRI results than my neurologist and answered all of my questions. I really appreciated the time he spent with me and his knowledge. I have a family member who is a doctor and they had provided me with a list of questions to ensure this was the right treatment for me. Everything was worked out very well.|Super doctors, nurses and staff. They are the most professional staff and nurses who actually help you get the treatment to solve your pain issues. I just wish I could have found them before I had surgery. Drs. Enis and Holt have done everything they can to help me live a pain free life and they have done an excellent job doing so. Thanks to them I have my life back.|I was being treated for chronic pain in my back.  When he decided to make an entirely different spinal injection than before and left me unable to walk, bend and get relief from pain meds.  He is in the same office with Dr. Ennis who is quite competant.  Dr. Holt is not and will ruin your quality of life.  I do not recommend Dr. Holt.|I have been a patient here for a couple months.

I was scared, as I had a horrific experience at another pain management facility; the procedure was so painful, I said to myself ""I will never go back there"". I explained my concerns. He listened to me! Our very first conversation I voiced the need to have a MRI before coming to see him. He said ""No you don't. I want you to show me where your pain is. The best way to help is for you to show me, and we can go from there"". He was kind to me! I repeat, He was kind to me! This is huge, as I have had doctors not be very kind to me in the past (they would not listen and caused an ungodly amount of pain) so this means a lot!  When doing the first procedure he knew I was very nervous. Dr. Savu talked to me through the whole thing. He wants to get to the root of the problem (no pun intended! Haha!) As of right now I have had two procedures, which have not helped much... and that is okay because it is part of it (trial and error) but he wants to find the source!

The doctor himself is fine but the staff is horrible and rude. I have never seen such callous behavior towards a disabled person.

When it was time for his procedure he still wasn't seen and other people kept going in before him. When he tried to ask someone a question they closed the door in his face. Since everyone was so rude, and this wasn't the first they have been rude, he left. They used to try and be sassy with him when they thought he was by himself. I have heard through the phone how they have talked to him, even from the head nurse or coordinator, whatever she was called.This man always came in laughing, smiling, or joking. I wonder to this day if the doctor knows he lost a patient because of the attitude of his staff. And for clarification purposes, I was his aide that traveled with him when I could.|Dr.Savu is a terrible Doctor and a terrible person. Doesn't listen and is always in a hurry.  I had a car bad car wreck at a red light where a SUV totalled my little Ford Focus. The last time I went to him he accused me of not doing the exercises he gave me. I told him every since the car wreck that my right side of my back was hurt more than ever and I was unable to do them. I told him again about the wreck and he said ""what wreck."" Also his pain shots don't help a bit!!!!|Going to be a new patient.  I haven't seen him yet, but my family has.  Even though I'm not a patient yet, he has messaged to check on me.

Every single month there are issues with them send my prescription, they don't bother calling you back until you call everyday for several days, they don't bother relaying messages to the Doctor when Dr Amidi tells you to call and let him know if something wasn't done.
This is one of the worst pain management clinics I have ever been to, which is sad because they were great. Do yourself a favor, go anywhere but here. Unless you enjoy being treated like you're ""just a junkie looking for a fix"".

Dr Amidi is great, and so is the main lady who answers the phone. That's why I gave them 2 stars.|I can only comment on the doctor that I have seen. The staff there is very nice and friendly, and the facilities are pretty clean. The doctor I see is very unprofessional, in that the doctor uses personal experience that has happened to the Dr family member, and treats me as if  they are treating the family member, and not ME. Everyone is not the same! This doctor freaked out on me because of a medication that I have been taking for years, and refused to give me a stronger medication  Again, based on ""personal"" experience with their family member. This doctor also told me specific health information about said family member, this is a huge HIPAA violation!!!!  I also have to see this doctor via Zoom/ Teams in the office, and I normally talk to a black screen as they can't figure out how to work their camera.  This place is a joke, but unfortunately, due to the ""opioid crisis"", everyone is treated as a drug addict/abuser, so you are at their mercy. Just praying I can find a ""real"" doctor to perhaps do some kind of surgery to not only relieve my pain, but to get away from this clinic, and off the pills altogether. If you don't mind an unprofessional place, so you can get your pain meds, go for it.|I recently had issues with getting and keeping health insurance. I suffered a bad fall last year, and am out of the workforce these days. Those at Pain Treatment Centers of America Fayetteville, have been great to work with me during this time, trying to get medication and proper procedures for my injuries and accidents. Thank you all there!|I was an actual patient here and I saw Dr. Shyanne Price. This isn't a meme or attention-seeking stunt.

I have never before been so ill-treated, dehumanized and uncared for as I was with my time at this facility. It was a terrible experience and I strongly recommend you avoid it. If your doctor sets up a referral here, ask for elsewhere. Here's my experience that lasted all of one month.

Before coming here I had found a great solution to my chronic pain from EDS in the form of light exercise and prescribed Tylenol 3. No side effects, no addiction or dependence issues. It really helped. My doctor eventually referred my care to Pain Treatment Centers of America and a situation that was improving immediately regressed.

On my very first day which should be pretty much just gathering information, asking what works and such, they tell me that I was wrong. That my medication, Tylenol 3, wasn't good enough. That I needed something different. I tried telling the doctor that it was working but she assured me she had something better. She prescribed me a new medication called Diclofenac, saying it was a better and more effective medicine. I don't know why we were disrupting something that worked but I trusted her because she was a professional.

I had a terrible reaction to the medicine. Sorry this gets a little graphic, but after just two days of taking it as prescribed my pain wasn't being assisted and instead I developed extreme stomach discomfort, bloody stools and uncontrollable bowel movements. This resulted in missed work, worsening pain and extreme embarrassment .

i immediately contacted my doctor to let them know of the situation. Their new medicine wasn't working  so I'd like to resume the one that I know works. Guess what they did? Instead of being medical professionals, listening to the patient and following what works, they did something unacceptable. She told me to stop taking the diclofenac and then advised she has no further medical recommendations for me.

So, I go there on the right path just seeking treatment, and all they do is make me sick, make my pain intolerable by removing my medication that has worked for a year and then casting me to the side for reasons I'm assuming are to do with the fact they cared little about me and saw me as just a number that they'd worry about later.

Screw this place and I strongly caution anyone that goes here as, although I can't speak for everyone, it's quite literally the only medical facility where I've come out worse than I was before.

If any of you reading would like photo evidence of our conversations or medications to prove i actually went here and am telling the truth, I will provide them if needed.|Well the there are so understanding and polite and helpful  me and cinnamon love everybody there|Small but a very nice facility.

The gal (callie) at the front desk is awesome as well very polite and super helpful. If you are looking for a great medical staff look no further.|The receptionist (I think her name is Callie) always has an attitude and will be short with you if you ever call to cancel an appointment even if its an emergency. I let it go because I thought maybe she was just having a bad day but I've overheard her being rude to other patients on the phone multiple times along with how badly she treats my family member. I would go somewhere else if there was another option simply because of how rude she is.|Was refered to her from my Private Care physician because I am on Pain meds. So she told me she was refering me to ain management. I said YEA right been refered 7 times now they never called. But Dr Cathy Luo actually clinic actually called. Got  an appointment. Though the front desk woman is rather rude. I can live with it. So I seen Cathy Luo 1 time and she scheduled me for Steroid epidural injections. I told her I had them before they do not work on me. So wanted to know what I was on for pain. I told her tramadol. She wanted to change it. She wanted Oxycodone, or Oxycotten, Or Morhine. I said NO WAY those have to many side effects and my Body Does not Do well On them. So I went in April 5th for my Epidural and it has been 34 days. The right side is doing really good the left is kind of touchy. But I go back May 20th so I will let her know then.|Dr Kathy Luo pays attention to her patients, listens, & ACTUALLY CARES.  She is Conscientious, thoughtful & REALLY GOOD AT HER JOB- it is MORE than just a job to her.  I truly appreciate how Dr Kathy Luo LISTENS to my issues and concerns & she's extremely knowledgeable! She's cares about her community and public education as well- & she works so hard every year, during her time off- to help bring Culture &the art of dance, as well as Cuisine to the  young people in her community.  She's an asset everywhere she goes.
If you are looking for a pill mill THIS IS NOT THAT.  Dr Luo is a very smart, thoughtful doctor.
Callie answers the phone up front, schedules appointments, & everything! She is such a wonderful person! Always helpful, and pleasant to talk to! It's so nice to have someone up front that is actually NICE, & HELPFUL! I JUST ADORE CALLIE!!
THE NURSES & staff in the back, also very NICE, & personable.  It sure helps make your day a nicer one when greeted by professional and friendly people!!
**I have been elsewhere - you will not find this level of Care,  or Committment anywhere else! @!8
** The other places I have been to- you can tell by the disposition of the staff - if the doctors care about the staff and patients- then the nurses and other personel feel good about their job-
On the other hand- if when you walk in to a PAIN management Clinic & the Dr always begins his conversation with you ( the patient) with a very demanding sentence like. ""Good News; I ONLY want to here GOOD NEWS"" and then very quickly follows that with ""Everything is just fine, right? Good News, only, right? ""
Then you already know-

Thank you, always- to Dr Luo, Callie,  & her entire staff: For being CARING & PROFESSIONAL &  FOR LISTENING TO YOUR PATIENTS, & for HELPING as much as you possibly can!!|I really haven't liked Dr Luo. You never get to have a real sit down with her. She rushes in for no more than 5 minutes. She'll just walk out of the room and you are left just sitting there waiting for her to come back. She doesn't!! I've been going to her for several years now and the routine never changes. Most likely going to see another doctor. It's gotta get better than this.|The the front desk office worker, Callie, is possibly the worst person I've ever met.",2023-09-24|2024-12-02|2024-03-01|2022-04-08|2022-05-10|2021-11-05|2019-05-07|2023-09-25,5|1|5|1|4|5|2|1,,,,,"Wheelchair accessible seating, Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Gender-neutral washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ5aYB8gdsyYcRUE0dg38mRTc,12

My appointment was for 3:45. There is a little bit of traffic and I got there at 3:50. I was told the doctor had already left for the day. They told me that I could have called and let them know that I was going to be late.... I was driving through traffic and I don't make phone calls when I drive. Being 5 minutes late and not being able to be seen is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Dr Kent.... Very unprofessional. I would not recommend this office at all. They do not have the patient's best interest at heart.|Hands down the kindest clinic in Conway. They have gone out of their way for my specific situation and I will be forever grateful. Dr. Kent is very knowledgeable but also has great bedside manner which is very hard to find in the area. Although it is a clinic for pain, you don't feel as if you are an experimental subject like other clinics. Great communication with their patients!|The medical staff as well as the ladies at the front desk are wonderful! Dr. Kent was direct, to the point and performed my injections quickly and comfortably. The downside to this office is the insurance person. She is rude, unprofessional and clearly doesn't understand how insurance actually works. They will over bill you up front and then take over six months to return the overpayment. It's sad that one person can ruin the experience and quality of an entire clinic. I will not be back.|This facility went above and beyond to help me urgently! The office runs smoothly, they are very kind, lots of welcoming smiles. The nurses are so nice and helped me feel very comfortable. I was very happy with Dr. Kent. He helped me feel reassured with procedures he was going to do. I highly recommend this office.|I have been a patient of Dr. Kent and his staff for about 5 years. I have always been treated with the utmost of professionalism and courtesy. I have had many procedures over the years including surgeries. Dr. Kent is a very skilled surgeon who I trusted for some very delicate procedures. I highly recommend Dr. Kent and Prestige Spine practice as a whole!!|If I could only rate ""0""
Words can't express the suffering I have went through, physically, mentally and emotionally after going through an ablasion procedure. I have visited ER, Primary Doctor, and referral to a new pain management Doctor. This place is the worse. My procedure was done in August and I am still trying to understand how I was using a cane periodically, to using it daily. The receptionist was rude (did not have one ounce of empathy post procedure), Doctor was very smooth in his talking, as if he actually cared. He proceeded to do this procedure without doing an MRI, nor using the MRI imaging from previous doctor (out of state ). No previous medical records (adequate time to receive) solely done with notations. I was under the impression from this Doctor, the office had received ""all"" information (a month later). I would have never agreed to this otherwise. I have been dealing with this chronic pain for over 20 years including 2 back surgeries. I trusted them to do their job efficiently and effectively. I can't believe I allowed this to happen. The procedure was done quickly and the medical staff (for procedure) was very unprofessional. It was like an assembly line. I had no recovery time after drugs had been administed, and was rushed out the office. (I have had this procedure done once before, so the way this was done is just absolutely gut wrenching). I called the office 3-4 times regarding excruciating pain. Spoke with Doctor, who was more concern with business reputation, than me, the patient. (That I stated without biases) ""Nothing"" was done. During the follow-up, the Doctor proceeds with possibly correcting the issue with steroid injection. I asked for a referral, at this point, I am livid, never again would my care be in his hands. Four months later and I am still trying to get answers. All insurance companies should do an assessment on this facility. Insurance schemers for sure. I am not done in proceeding in gathering information regarding this facility and making them accountable.|I love this clinic. The front office staff are super friendly, as are the nurses. I was a bit intimidated by Dr. Judkins. He is not a big talker but he listens. I have had spinal ablation done 4 times and I was terrified bc another doctor had hurt me during the procedure. Dr. Judkins did and amazing job. He was gentle, his nursing staff were amazing and I will not go anywhere else to have this done! Thank you Dr. Judkins and the entire staff bc you all are amazing!|There isn't a better doctor in the world!  Dr. Sheffield Kent is absolutely the best!  Have had numerous procedures performed in the office as well. His staff is not only professional but kind and caring. If a patient is looking for a physician, I highly recommend Dr. Kent.

You will not get any better care.|My experience with the doc so far is pretty fantastic.I believe he and his staff are wonderful but busy! I have been dealing with my problems for a long time. And although I am a fairly new client,he and his staff have helped me tremendously!! I greatly appreciate them , and If you don't, go somewhere else, the waiting room is small.   Ha ,, just kidding !! kinda ?? People saying crappy things about someone who is trying to help you, that you asked for, for crying out loud , I believe is absurd ! I think maybe some people need to think before they think . Definitely before they speak!!!  Any way, every body please pray for my chic.she is trying to kick her Cancers ASS and she could use a helping thought .... thanks Doc.|Horrible experience!  Horrible doctor.  Horrible nurse.  Horrible staff.  That whole office is horrible and incompetent.  Everyone working there is extremely rude and disrespectful to the patients.  Very unprofessional!|Great bedside manner. RN's and nurses are great and greeted me with a smile. Even the receptionist is friendly. Dr. Rafi seems kind,, knowledgeable and professional. Again the kindness and caring of the staff and Dr Rafi are extremely hard to come by. If I ever do have to wait I have to say it's worth it.|Dr Rafi is nice. Doesn't listen much to what you say though. Part of the reason is nurse Angela putting in her two cents to the point everything gets lost in frustration. I left as a patient today at the urging of my friends and family. They are the ones that see what I'm going through. I always felt like I was doing something wrong by going there. Shout out to Harley, the girl at the front desk (can't remember her name), Kala and the others that made the experience tolerable. Always advocate for yourself if you are in pain. No one else will, especially Angela. I have a new doc that I am confident can actually help me now. Never give up, there is help out there.|This is an awful pain management clinic. I waited 2 and 1/2 hours to see the doctor on my initial spot. Dr Ravi doesn't make eye contact and his nurse does all the talking. They are unorganized.|I just finished an appointment with my grandmother. Wait times are absolutely ridiculous. Just spent an hour waiting in waiting room and then another 20 minutes in the back room before being taken to the procedure room. They need better time management. When asking about the wait time, the front desk person was short and frankly rude.",2025-02-17|2025-01-22|2025-01-18|2024-12-30|2024-01-19|2022-03-28|2024-05-30|2023-08-23,1|5|5|1|5|1|2|2,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff,,,,,,,,,,ChIJAQD0Sr1TzIcR5Qu4t_sJWTU,26

Staff and the Dr were very friendly and they listened. Finally, someone who's actually listening & trying to help! Or so I thought.
My follow-up appointment I had to reschedule because of an impromptu meeting I had to attend. I called to reschedule & was given a date 2.5 months later & was told to call at a later date to see if someone cancelled. Well, I did. And after the 3rd time calling & nothing was still available, I started thinking this was pointless & was just going to wait on my appointment. Plus, I believe they were getting irritated with me calling. (Deducting one star) No biggie, as I'm aware this is becoming common at Dr offices. However, I'm now out of medication and wanted to get a refill....but, after waiting several days for it to be sent to the pharmacy (because I was told they were going to) I finally called the office again; only this time to be told that I can't get any meds because I haven't had my follow up appointment. Which is now 2 months away. (Deducting another star)
Fast forward to appointment date. I leave work in order to make it to the appointment 30 minutes early as they suggest. The sign in process is a bit long. As she's finishing she states, the Dr isn't in so we're just taking specimen samples & calling in refills. Now, I'm very irritated for several reasons. 1-No one called and said the Dr was out, nor to reschedule. 2-what am I giving a sample for when I've had no medication to take so therefore it's impossible to have any in my system, so what are you checking for!? And had to leave my purse on the counter unattended while doing so. 3-Next appointment date is now 3 months away!
I went to the pharmacy several hours later, and I'm told they have no prescription for me & it's now after 5 and the Dr office is closed so there's no one to call to see what's going on with the transmission of the prescription or if it's ever been sent. (Deducting another star)
I left a message, so I'm currently waiting on a call back.
Needless to say, I'm feeling very unsure about the treatment at this facility. As I mentioned, the initial visit was great, but it went downhill after that.
I just want to know what's going on & get treatment for it. Medical options are limited for this rural area, so I may have to find someone outside of this area.|This was my first visit and I was very pleased with every thing. The staff was very courteous.  Dr. McCoy is very polite and he listen to what I to say. I like the fact that he wanted to check into my conditon further to get to the real cause. No one else had mention this to me.  If I could grade him it would be A+x3.  I am very pleased. My experience was Great!|I'm so thankful for Dr. McCoy!!

I came here seeking help for severe degenerative spine issues and a neck fracture, hoping to avoid surgery. Unfortunately, the only option offered was spinal injections.

I received two injections--one in my neck and one in my lower spine. While the neck injection provided slight relief, the one in my lower back was completely ineffective. I was informed that these injections contained numbing medication, similar to the epidurals I received during pregnancy. However, I was never made aware that they also contained steroids.

I take responsibility for not doing thorough research beforehand, but my pain was overwhelming, and I was desperate for relief. Sadly, the injections affected my mood and menstrual cycle. When I raised these concerns with the clinic, the staff suggested I was experiencing menopause rather than acknowledging the potential side effects of the injections.

The staff were rude and lacked basic bedside manner. I would never recommend this clinic to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I felt misled, and every time I mentioned my concerns, they dismissed me as if I were imagining my symptoms.

I urge anyone considering treatment here to do thorough research on their own. When the injections failed to help, I was told there was nothing more they could do for me. They never discussed medication management or alternative options; it felt like they were simply brushing me off because I raised concerns about the adverse reactions I was experiencing. Overall, I left feeling unheard and abandoned|What the Hell kind of pain management place is this. Even after readying many negative reviews I still gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I should have listened to the majority.  PLEASE  PLEASE DON'T GO HEAR. These people not only don't care but literally go out of their way to downplay your  injuries/surgeries/pain..whatever is going on. Before seeing the doctor his nurse came in and the first thing she said after getting my vitals is, ""our doctors do not prescribe pain medication for any reason no matter what"".  Other than to say hello, I hadn't spoken yet at this point.
I've had one visit so far on 9/4/24 and ultimately decided to do a procedure on my neck scheduled for 9/12/24. The doctor seemed pretty confident this procedure will give me some relief after around 1 week following the procedure. I'm desperate and willing to try and I've been waiting for about 3 months for this 1st visit.
Today I speak to the nurse who says let's schedule your follow-up. My follow-up is October 21st.  That's over a month after the procedure.  What if it doesn't help? I've already waited 3 months for my 1st appointment. I've had multiple car accidents,  broken bones and surgeries. Although I didn't ask for medication of ANY kind it's a bit disheartening to be told that it can never be an option.  Seems odd for a ""pain management clinic "".
So far...they're in no hurry to see me, no hurry to follow-up after a procedure to check for effectiveness and very quick to inform me of their no ""pain medication policy.""  This was my experience on my first day.|Not helpful at all. Was referred by my 'doctor' for my neuropathy issue. Got a prescription for antidepressants and told to use otc capsaicin cream. I'm paying over $300 after insurance paid their part for absolutely nothing. Very disappointed.|Absolutely wonderful people! I have always been treated with the upmost respect by every person at this clinic. None of the nurses, APRN's or doctors do anything without making sure I feel comfortable. They are so warm and inviting. The front desk girls are so sweet. They always welcome me with a big smile and joke around a little to put me at ease. I go here for spinal procedures and am always nervous about it but their team has a way to put you completely at ease and I trust them 100% with my care.|Dr. Benson is very thorough. I have been to numerous pain clinics and he is by far the most thorough in explaining why and what is causing the issues that I'm having.|Dr Green has absolutely no bedside manners. I find him rude and unpleasant.
I can say the same thing for his nurse practitioner. After I spent a big amount of money in this place he would not even see me for the follow up but put it off on his nurse practitioner.
Every surgery appointment I had, he busted in the room without a hello and just carried on making jokes with his staff.
Once out of 3 times I had a more pleasant experience. The other times I was not well attended to. Treaded rude.
I will not return especially since the treatment did not work but maybe 30%
I hope you read this Dr Green. You need to change your ways. I felt almost violated laying there trusting you with my body and you could have cared less!!!!
He was ordered by my Neurologist to perform Ablations on my Cervical Spine but found it more important to do my Lumbar Section First. Nice Ego|These doctors do not care about your health or wellbeing. They deny seeing people for no reason and can't even be considerate to call and let you know. Please read the reviews here. Even mercy pcp's talk about how much of a hell hole this place is. They are ""opiate free"" which is a joke. Oh but they'll prescribe garbage medication that makes your teeth fall out because that's the medicine they get the kickbacks on. Can only hope that these barbaric doctors who treat people like this end up in excruciating pain and no one will help them.|There needs to be a zero star option. Dr. Green has absolutely zero empathy or compassion. He argued with me over my diagnosis, which has been confirmed through extensive imaging by a neurosurgeon, two orthopedic surgeons, and a specialized upper cervical chiropractor -- four different doctors. I've been all the way to Johns Hopkins (three times), and Dr. Green had the audacity to question Johns Hopkins! I've been living with severe chronic pain for over 6 years, and am on the verge of being bedridden and disabled. Some days I can't even be upright for more than a few minutes, due to the extreme pain I experience, from all the pressure / compression my brain stem is being subjected to. Currently in treatment doing stem cell / platelet rich plasma therapy, but if these fail, I will have to get cervical fusion neck surgery. In the meantime, my neurosurgeon suggested that Dr. Green prescribe something I could take on an as needed basis -- just on the days where the pain threshold is too much to handle; something I could take to help get me thru the work day. Dr. Green not only argued with me about my diagnosis (he went on and on about stuff that's way out of his area of expertise, and it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about), but he also refused to prescribe anything, outside of the medications that I've already tried, which have not helped. I'm absolutely baffled and stunned that the local medical system is so broken, that a person who has endured as many years of extreme pain as I have, would be turned away. I can't help but wonder, according to Dr. Green, if I don't ""qualify"" -- then who in the world would? Makes me feel sad for anyone else who may also be turned away, after experiencing as much pain and hardship. There's no telling how many people Dr. Green has turned away. There is absolutely no way this man actually cares about any of his patients, or how much pain they're in. Given his distinct lack of empathy, it's clear that he has no concept of what it's like to have to live with extreme chronic and disabling pain. Dr. Green is an absolute and utter disgrace to the profession, and should be completely ashamed of himself. Don't waste your time here, save yourself the disappointment, and go ahead and look elsewhere.",2025-02-25|2024-09-09|2024-09-27|2024-05-29|2024-11-27|2021-03-14|2024-04-04|2022-11-28,1|1|1|5|5|1|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","Do you take Medacaid?","Yes they do with referral from pc",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJG8R5GpkQyYcRlZZ5tQ2HFmE,30

The nurses, all were very nice even at reception. It really wasn't that long of a wait either, I waited maybe 30 minutes before I saw the doctor. There were plenty of seats as well. There were people there, of course, but there were enough seats for everyone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has chronic pain.|I can't say enough about how happy I am with Dr Rafi. He basically saved my life with his expertise He suggested that I get a spinal cord stimulator. Well it worked and I am out of pain. Believe me I have some bad days but most are excellent. They have a very good experienced staff who is always considerate and supportive but most of all they are truly compassionate. They have my vote and I would never consider a change
My thanks to Dr Rafi and his staff|Dealt with back pain issues for 20 years. Have gone to multiple pain doctors over the years. This Doctor is the first one to figure it out and get me some relief. Great Doctor! Great guy and super staff!|Doctor doesn't talk much.  Rude nurse does the talking.  She doesn't listen to what u have to say.  When you call they don't answer.  That's your job to answer phones. WAITING time is 2 + hours. You see him for 5 minutes.  THEY need to do injections in the morning. They over book.  They treat you like u r dumb.  The good reviews are the staffs family.  Unorganized|I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. First of all you have to wait hours before the Dr. will even see you. When he does he barely even speaks to you he has one of his nurses do all the talking for him. Also, the staff is rude. The only reason I keep going there is because I have arthritis in my lower back and the injections he gives me are the only thing that helps, long lasting anyway, otherwise, I would have seen if my doc could have referred me to anyone else. I also have to say that when you call them wanting refills on any of your prescriptions they forget and you end up having to call again. You shouldn't have to call twice just to get your prescription refilled. They also shouldn't have to ask you when was the last time you saw Dr. Rafi all I want is refills on my prescriptions so I don't think that's even necessary|Don't bother going here if you want to get in, get seen and then leave. Be prepared to wait over 2 hours in a cramped waiting room with floor seating only. I saw the lady scan my cards in the computer and she didn't hand them back until I was about to give a urine sample. I even heard her say, and I quote 'I wasn't going to use them for anything bad' when I asked for them back before giving the sample. Plus they have a sign in the bathroom, with a door that barely closes and refuses to lock easily, stating not to wash your hands until the unloved lab tech has your sample. That is unsanitary and sickening on many levels. If you scan the cards you should hand them back immediately.  I had five people in front of me and that was fine but the lady two people ahead of me was there for almost over two hours at that point. People that are hurting shouldn't be treated like cattle so a pain specialist can see them. I have never felt more dehumanized before entering this office. I will NEVER return and will NOT recommend this place to anyone. I would rather deal with the pain I am in rather than return here. It may make me feel crazy but at least I'll have my dignity.|5 hour wait to find out that had no information. I had been on Tylenol 4 for months. That is all my pcp could do I seek out this place to help my pain. They cut my meds in half for no reason. Then told me I was in a contract and couldn't go elsewhere for meds. I have mri showing herniated disc in my neck and spinal stenosis, arthritis. So not even knowing what my mri showed he cut my meds in half. I called and let them know I was in severe pain. They said that's what they wanted to do at this point. Do not go here !! They sent me for x rays after I told them I just had them done at my pcp. He does not seem to care. I'm currently speaking to surgeons for my spine surgery maybe it will help. This place will not do anything,bust waste your time.|I've never had a doctor and his Assistant go into such great detail about my condition.

There is never a long wait. They seem dedicated to keeping appointment times so you're not waiting for hours like in some doctors offices. I only have one minor suggestion. I was dispatched to an out-of-state assignment for 48 hours and of course, during that time is my scheduled appointment. I have never had to reschedule an appointment before. We'll see

Are use the app and asked to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was immediately rescheduled. However, it was rescheduled for four days after my medication would run out.  I asked if there was anyway possible I could be rescheduled before I ran out of my medication I was told no that was the only option available. I've been asked is the doctor would refill my prescription for a few days so I would not miss my medication. The answer was also negative. Then I asked if I could be put on a waiting list in case someone cancel between now and in two weeks when my appointment is scheduled for. I was told ""no we don't have a list"". I felt the response was rude and insensitive. Understanding how sick my body will be without my scheduled medication for three days is very scary. Knowing that my doctors office was not willing to help in anyway  has given me reason to pause and consider different clinic. However, I do like my doctor and the nurses have been great. When I paid only $40 per month I'm just stuck on how to handle three days with no medication. I can't afford to miss work so I can't stay home . I just wish the person who responded online and offered some type of solution or temporary remedy that could help my situation.

Yes, I am able to reach someone at the clinic this coming week to see if they will give me a refill for three days then I will change my rating to 5 stars.|I've been with ptcoa for 7 pr more years.

And I've done some research and it's what I think is happening. I have 8-10 yeti cups of water a day and some at night because of my blood sugar levels and it's what my endocrinologist has said to do. I truly believe it is the problem. I take my medication and yes I may skip a day or two but after 2 trips to the hospital and shots of very strong opiates and testing negative it hasta be the water Deluding my test. I only post this in hopes that I can help with my pain and medication to be referred and maybe help someone else out if they have the same issues. Please I don't want withdrawals to happen over something I don't understand|4 tries to even get an appointment got canceled 3 times due to no doc or some other reason. So 4 months of waiting to get in.

Told I would be receiving a shot on first appointment only to find out that was not the case. Lucky owner was there and made it happen.

Drug test every appointment no history of illegal drugs.

On follow up after x-rays (already had mri before first appointment) was told I has degenerative disc disease need spacers in my l3 thru l5. Signed paperwork to get on the schedule. Called today almost a month later not even a note in my file about any procedure. Owner was in the room when all this happened.

I will be looking for a new doc again.....|I actually changed to the Conway AR location due to unprofessional treatment at the Little Rock AR office on Markham Street.
Dr. Angela has excellent bedside manners. She is very caring and listens to what you have to say.
I was not aware that I needed to go get my medication without a call from the  pharmacists. (My fault). I also changed my pharmacy in order that I could pick them up all at the same pharmacy I use for all my additional medication. Filling out a form was required however it was not used to call in the prescription. (Really)
Staff please pay close attention to your patients. If we are held to an upmost regard concerning your rules, please pay close attention to our request. We really don't want to feel like a number. Pain is no joke.|Angela is a super Nurse Practitioner. I give her my highest recommendations. She is always pleasant and compassionate. I trust her judgement.|This business requires you to submit to a drug test before they will even let you see a doctor.  They don't tell you that the drug testing costs $661!  The cost to me after insurance is $158.51.  They explain that this drug testing is required for liability reasons.  ""What if the patient is on drugs that are incompatible with a prescription?""  I have never experienced anything like this at any other practice.  If this business wants to require drug testing to protect itself from potential liabilities, then the cost of this testing should be covered by the business.

They require this drug testing regardless of the care they ultimately provide and regardless of whether they prescribe a controlled substance.  The only benefits I received from this clinic was a referral for an MRI, a referral to a surgeon, and a referral to a physical therapist.  I don't see how any of these benefits relate to the excessive drug screening.

There is no incentive for AR Spine and Pain to negotiate costs of the drug testing or to search for the most affordable testing.  Since they don't incur the cost, they don't limit the drug testing to patients that require prescriptions for controlled substances.  I would be happy to sign any waivers stating whether I am taking any other drugs, and this should put any liability on me.  This is especially true for individuals that have no medical or legal records of illegal drugs.|Dara did a excellent job of taking care of me. she was very helpful in getting my needs met|Excellent Doctors who actually listens to you.

I reduced my hours to 4 hours a day at work, I can stand longer than what I was at first without hurting so bad. I then had lower back injections,hip bursa, knee injections and I feel way better than I ever did. I been doing more house hold choirs around the house and exercising. I still have to sit down a little but not as much as I had to do at first. So, I thank Dr. Dogra for everything. Now he did say it will come back but, I'm ok with that because of the type of work I do and it requires heavy lifting and turning.

AWESOME  DR DOGRA AND HIS STAFF ARE!!!!!!!I have b to 2 pain centers in Little Rock who both have excellent reputations.  But I didnt experience very much relief.  I heard thru multiple sources about Dr. DOGRA. My very first appointment with him I found him to be VERY personable, VERY professional and very knowledgeable.  He  REALLY  listened to me and expressed his. Concern for my quality of life, such as it was at that time. Dr. Dogra told me what he would do to ""FIX""  me and I left his office knowing he WOULD FIX ME...and he did.  I will always have issues with my right hip and my back.  He burned my nerves last February and I'm just now showing signs of pain coming back.  I again started seeing him 2 weeks ago because of pain in my right shoulder all the way in my fingers.  He will be repeating the same procedures on this now.  I have no doubt in my mind that he will also succeed in reducing or alleviating my pain yet again I will recommend him to everybody I mate and have been doing so since the first time I saw him. Call him you will not be disappointed|I am so GRATFUL with being introduced to the Doctor and his TEAM!!This was my second visit I had a procedure done on both knees. The technical support the Doctor he explained every step to me and  his nurses allows you to see all while he preforms the procedures.  I have been on bed rest have had night sweats and left  knee in pain  However, I did get up set up for about two hours so I guess this is pay back for getting up. I will follow the doctor's instructions.  I return back August 8th @9:30am for my hips  then return for my spine and I found out I have a slight curve in my lower called scoliosis.

Does NOT care about the patient or their needs. All she wants to do is shove needles in you.

I was referred by my PCP for a spinal herniation in July. In the last 6 months Dr. Abraham and his phenomenal, caring, REAL, staff have provided me with the best quality medical care I have EVER received!!!
I truly cannot thank them enough for how much they have helped me!
My case has been a classic ""if it can go wrong, it will go wrong"" with insurance being, well insurance. But all of the ladies (and gentlemen) up there have been such a pleasure to work with, they make me feel so validated and have gone above and beyond to get me the treatment I needed!
I have never once felt uncomfortable, anxious or like I wasn't supposed to be there, which is rare for me when it comes to doctors in general.
This is just an awesome place with beautiful souls working to truly help ease their patients pain!
I highly recommend!

They get to make you keep doing these injections and procedures and making big money off our insurance programs.

I waited 2 hours for my second to last appointment and I went to the  front desk and I told the lady that I had been in the room for almost 2 hours and I couldn't wait anymore from pain from sitting so long and my ride had been waiting, so I'd needed to reschedule. I rescheduled the appointment and when I came in for the appointment, the lady at the front desk told me that my appointment was last week and that I needed to pay a $50 no show fee. I said my appointment is for today and I have never messed up an appointment day and time and I have never no-showed for an appointment. I said do you think I would just come in here making up my own appointment and she said, well some people do. I saw the doctor and expanded everything and he said he'd waive the fee and his assistant was also in the room with us, typing on the laptop. I recieved a bill last week for the $50 no show fee and I called and talked to the lady at the front desk and she said she would contact billing and have it removed. I go in for my appointment today and the same front desk lady says, you owe $50 for the no show fee. I explain everything all over again and said I just talked to you and you were going to contact billing to get it removed and the doctor told me at my last appointment, that he was waiving the fee. She said okay, I'll talk to the doctor. After 30 minutes of me waiting, she says the doctor said he won't see you until you pay the $50. I said this is absolutely crazy and if this is how this doctor and practice is, remove me as a patient and she said, okay great. I can't believe a doctor would lie like this and be so desperate for $50. It wasn't about the money as it was not my fault and I was lied to. I am making sure to let all of my physicians and family and friends know, to not go here.|I've never been treated so well as I have with Dr. Maryanov, he was through and then sat down and showed me everything and talked to me about it.

He always takes time to explain things to me and he has taken very good care of my shoulder and back if it wasn't for him I don't know what my shoulder would be like today.|I've always gotten great care. The strive to help patients not just give them medication and send them on|I went to my last appointment and he chewed his nurse out in front of me in the patient room with me next to them , chewed her out over an ink pen and for giving someone a cup of coffee , the Dr should handle his business with his employees away from the patient and he told me that I cam across like some kind of weirdo or something !
He should not allow his anger to take control in from of the patient !
I will never go back !!!!|Everyone is so very kind and helpful. I had to bring my 1 year old son (he had missed his nap and was being distracting) & everyone was so patient and helpful. The dr was thorough, patient, caring, quite helpful and did an exceptionally good job explaining his plan for me.

He does explain things and gives me options of which injections I want to do and what each injection will target. When I do the Cervical injections, I have to take time getting up because I will pass out. The nurse stays with me until I can get up safely. All the staff have been very nice, helpful, and I feel treated with care.|Had neck pain and was sent there.  I was told I would get a shot in the neck and there would be tightness and I didn't need to be driving due to any affects the shot or medication might have.  But come time for the shot it felt like he was in a hurry and impatient and when he gave it to me he was pushing the medication in fast and I said it was hurting and didn't feel right.  He said it was fine and he was about done and I said I was losing my sight and hearing and he said he was done and walked out.  I became panicked at no sight and by the time he shut the door I couldn't hear and I was doing all I could to not pass out and the nurse had lifted me and I was already getting sick and the pain was horrible.  She got mad and said they needed the room soon for the next patients and asked if I needed help to the waiting room... I still couldn't sit up and my sight was barely there and my hearing was still messed up and I'm over the trash can throwing up.. As soon as I was able to walk they took me to my car to where my driver was and said all was well and I had just a little pain... And I never received any paperwork or anything from them that day saying what they did and what happened.  It was as if they hurry up and got me out of there and moved on.  To this day I can't tell you what they did or gave me because they will not give me my own information. I highly do not recommend this place!|My first appointment with Dr. Brent was terrific!  He has a pleasant bedside manner. He ran a test that confirmed his initial diagnosis. The results were positive, and I look forward to my next appointment.|My 1st appointment I was advised Dr. Weilert would only need my prior mri, CT reports, not disks. He stated at that appointment he would need my disks, as well as every prior treatment in the last 7 years. The next day I brought my disks in, signed consent forms & gave them several doctors offices info, including their fax #'s. A few weeks later I followed up with them & they acted like I was speaking a foreign language, no clue what I was talking about. I thought I straightened everything out, when they assured me they'd get the consent forms sent, but they have yet to call me back, or reach out to prior providers a month later & refuses to see me other wise (despite proof of a recent spine surgery). I've finally given up & decided to just drive the 3 hours to my prior PM doctor. I'm not sure their goal is to treat patients as much as it is to show them on the books.|I had an appointment in December and the doctor made sure my concerns were discussed and agreed to go with a conservative treatment.|He seems to know what he's talking about, but he doesn't really listen to the patient. He goes more off of records and cuts you off when you try to tell him something. And you can forget about privacy in his office. They'll jerk your pants down with the door open for the world to see. Plus they don't tell you about side effects. I got home and couldn't hardly walk. The office staff was very friendly helping me figure out if I needed to go to the ER or not, but he didn't tell me about the after effects. I'll be going to someone else.|I saw Dr. Weilert for just over a year for chronic pain and muscle paralysis. He's a competent physician, but he was either distracted or too busy to take the time to conduct a thorough investigation. Each visit, we'd ""try"" the same procedure with minimal relief, only to say that we could try something else during the last visit. Regrettably, my pain persists to this day. I just received a call stating that I had been dodging bills from Dr. Weilert's office. They are threatening to send my bills to a collection agency, despite no previous contact regarding these delinquent bills. I'm disappointed by the lack of transparency and care that is displayed by this clinic.|My fist visit with Dr. Brent Weilert was great.

I had an appointment on Friday, November 8th at 8 am and I honestly overslept.  My child was late for school on this date.  I called the office at 8:03 am and was honest and apologized.  I asked if I could just come in and wait until he had an opening to see me.  (Let's be honest these visits are very brief.)  I was told no and that I would be rescheduled for Tuesday.  I did request to not get another 30 late fee because I am struggling financially, but that is neither here nor there.  I was informed that someone would reach out to me because billing was done in Conway.  Around 12:30pm or 1pm, I received a text telling me that my appointment was cancelled and I have been resigned from the clinic.  I was devastated because I struggle with anxiety and finding another doctor and starting again is very hard.  I am discouraged and disappointed.   I asked to be reconsidered and was informed that Dr. Mocek was not willing to do that.  I have never asked for an increase in any medications and would bring my medication as requested to each visit    I never denied doing any random drug screen.  I only saw Dr. Mocek once a year and when I received injections. I am know faced with finding another pain management clinic because the back pain will come back within in six months.

I was excited that I just started feeling better when I was finally able to get the nerve burnt that was causing me so much pain.  I hope to find another pain management clinic that operates differently and genuinely care about patients and their health.|Dr MOCEK is absolutely fantastic. He is highly respected by his patients and by the Medical Community. He's caring, he listens, he's experienced and his staff is absolutely wonderful. The facility is very nice . He & his team will treat your pain with some of the most up to date treatments available.|DrMocek and his staff have been an enormous blessing to me. I have finally found a place that cares and listens to me. My APRN, Forrest, is amazing. He listens and helps me with all my pain issues. He is so understanding and easy to talk to. My life is better due to Mocek Spine Center|I love him i was in a wheel chair when I went to see him and now I don't even need my walker are cane.|No help whatsoever.  I went to Dr. Mocek for chronic back pain.  I saw him in person once then he sent me to PT.  It actually worked and I got better.  Maybe a couple weeks later I had a severe issue with my back and I could not use my right leg.  I could not walk and was in severe pain.  I called Dr. Mocek's office and they told me that I wasn't scheduled to see him for another two months.  They said they would give the info to the doctor.  Well, I never heard back.  I called again the next day and got hit with the same attitude.  They again told me I was not scheduled for another two months, then silence.  It was obvious I was bothering them.  I went to see a great chiropractor in conway who got me walking again.  Then when I went to see my primary care doctor he said Mocek was totally unnecessary.  He said between him and my chiropractor there was no need to see Mocek.  I cancelled the rest of my appointments and haven't looked back.

I can't say whether Dr. Mocek is a good doctor or not but what I can say is that he is WAY overbooked and it is affecting his bedside manner in a very negative way.  All I wanted to do was talk to the doctor an explain what was going on and get his advice.  He could have at least got on the phone with me and said go to the emergency room, or let me call in a prescription to help, or get to my office right away,  or something.  I was totally ignored as if he did not give a hoot.   I'll never go to him again.|I have been a patient of Dr. Mocek 's for over five years. He would not recognize me if he met me in the hall way. After his initial assessment and procedures you are handed over to uncaring/false nurse practitioners. No matter the severity of your pain they could not care less. I know the problems with the government take over of physicians' abilities to prescribe but no one has taken away  their abilities of being sympathetic and kind.  When in pain there are times when you just need a pat. Dr. Mocek's credentials are excellent but he has undertaken to meet the shortage of pain doctors  ( because he cares or because of the money, who knows) and that leaves him on a very tight schedule leaving very little time for courtesy. There is one excellent young lady nurse practitioner there but I apologize for not remembering her name. His front desk staff, lab tech, most of the nurses are nice, helpful, timely, caring, professional,  I would give them a gold star. I am writing this in the thrones of severe pain waiting for a MRI tomorrow A.M. after being put off over a year so I am undoubtedly biased. Summation: Excellent credentials, lousy patient care. Assess what you need, go from there.|I heard of Mocek Spine from my father who was also a patient of Doctor Mocek. Like my father, I've also been very impressed by the level of care from both Doctor Mocek & his team. My first encounter was with Lisa. She is caring & informative. It was a great first impression. During my consultation, It was quickly apparent that Dr. Mocek is extremely intelligent & experienced. He is also detailed oriented. He is professional and he treats me like a patient, not a number.  He spent a considerable amount of time explaining my results and different options during my first visit. For the first time in months, I finally feel like I have a promising go forward plan put in place.

Side note: This plan isn't a bunch of medications that will create side effects & additional issues.|Rude, mouthy, and stormed out of the room when I was talking to him.

Very good doctor but staff. They truly take care of their patients. Dr silver has been on top of things even after hours|This is NOT a physician's office. This is a prescription mill. If all you want pain medication...this is your place.
If you don't want answers for your pain and you do want a supposed ""professional provider"" that is more interested in billing your insurance and how much they can collect from you than they are about the reason you're there...this is your place.
If you want someone that actually reviews the test results that THEY ordered...forget it.
Very much NOT pain ""management""!

Not professional also because Dr. Silver himself gave me am 8x10 copy of a menu for a restaurant he opened and suggested I visit and tell everyone.
Maybe if I had visited his restaurant and spent more money on what would surely be a disappointment and another waste of my money, he may have cared and actually performed as a medical doctor is expected to. (I still have the copy.)
Remember...YOU pay for doctors to care for you; no matter how much they make you feel like it's an honor to be seen by them.
Pain management is such a money mill that they can choose who they ""treat"" or don't treat based on reimbursement and cash.
It seems impossible to find one that actually wants to help you.|I haven't gotten into see znag yet.

She and her staff do an excellent job taking care of you.  I have been a pain patient with her and PTCOA since 2021 and it is worth the 2 hour drive to me to be seen by them|I would like to preface this by saying that I really like PTCOA for the most part. I was seeing Dr. Whaley, she left abruptly which left her patients having to see Dr. Brown. I had two rounds of injections. The first injections, Dr. Whaley did. I was given, sedatives and pain meds to make me comfortable. I felt minimal pain during the procedure. I have sleep apnea and my BMI is 52 which places me at a higher risk for complications per the anesthesiologist. So When I went to have my second injection done, the only thing I was giving was numbing medication and gas. The gas kind of made my chest hurt a little bit and the pain of the injections was excruciating. I wanted him to stop after he did only the right side, but we went ahead and did both sides. I do want to say that the injection has provided some relief to my lower back, but I am still in a lot of discomfort. They have me on a very low dose of a painkiller twice a day, but it doesn't help at all. I've tried to express this to multiple people And I just don't feel that I'm being heard. I understand the anesthesia but after that, I had a colonoscopy at a different facility and I did anesthesia. Propofol to be exact. I am looking forward to getting the nerve burns to help with this discomfort that I am experiencing, but if they can't find a way to sedate me, I just won't have the procedure. It was way too painful and uncomfortable. This is my honest opinion of the place. The staff at the front desk is phenomenal. The nurses that I have ran into are great even the doctors are great. I just don't like that. I'm not being heard for the most part.|Very friendly. Explained everything that was going to happen.  Made sure any of my concerns were addressed.

My 1st visit with the Dr was good. He listened and recommended a pain management plan that was a light dose of Tylenol with Codeine. I went back monthly as required but never saw Dr Whatcott. I saw his Nurse Practioner. The NP took urine samples every visit. The NP said my urinalysis had traces of Morphine and Hydrocodone and was abnormal. I've never taken those drugs and did some research. I found out it was common for your body to metabolize Codeine into Morphine and Hydrocodone. It said 93% of Caucasians metabolize Codeine into Morphine, and up to 11% of the Codeine analysis can show as Hydrocodone. I explained this to the NP based upon my research and said it wasn't abnormal. Anyway after 4 ""normal"" urinalysis were misinterpreted as abnormal, I was told they wouldn't see me anymore.
This is outrageous. Someone supposedly managing your pain kicks you to the curb because they don't know how to interpret a urinalysis. A competent clinic would have researched this and have practioners with better education.|The Dr. & Nurses are very good I've never had a problem with the medical service. But the scheduling department are VERY RUDE, & from month to month the scheduling rules change. 1st it's you only need to call the week before you need to be seen, and the next it's you should've called a month ago. It's a nightmare dealing with them every month! The billing dept. Is also horrible there's only one person & she is RUDE!|The Dr. is nice the APRN ....Depends on which one you get on how you are treated. Overall experience your summary notes will be completely different than what your vist was. My chart says things were discussed that wasn't & says I was warned I was going to be terminated as a patient the APRN I saw didn't warn me or even tell me I was being terminated I had to find out by reading it in my visit summary online. They also don't list all your health problems in your chart and will suggest alternative treatment 1 time then never discusses it again and says you are constantly giving excuses for not having that treatment when in fact they are not following up with suggested treatment. If you use this office you better double check your chart against your visit.|Well  I'm been seeing Dr.Whatcott well over 5yrs  ,He has a great team they all work together,and make an awesome team.give them your business you will be proud you did..I pain free , great job everyone see you soon.

Imagine. Recently Dr. Hassan asked my wife to come to the office to explain the benefits of the Spinal Chord Stimulator. The results were fantastic. The pain is reduced dramatically and my activity level has increased significantly. Don't hesitate. Make an appointment today.|I love everyone in this office from the receptionist to the nurses and Dr. Alshon is amazing.   They truly care about you as their patient and thats hard to find these days but I found them.  I never have a long wait I take all the time I need with the Dr he  doesn't rush your appt and won't stop until they find what's going to help you.  I am blessed to have found them
Thank you Dr Alshon|They love to do procedure after procedure even if they don't help. Also be prepared to be prescribed opiates without their concern for getting addicted. They don't offer much variety of treatments nor do they conversate with you about noon prescription ways to control your pain. I got so frustrated i tried to wean myself off the meds without success and end up having to go to an inpatient facility for detox just be cautious. The doctors are very nice but they really need to look at pain treatment as a whole mind and body application. There are so many other options out their. do your research!!|Been going there for years, Dr. Pereira and his staff are great good knee shot up a couple times a year very painless very good staff and nurses. I will not do anywhere else would highly recommend this place. If you are in need of Pain Management my referrals go fast.|Went for ketamine therapy for depression/anxiety. I haven't had any troubles in the past at other places, but this was quite a bad experience. The doctor really needs to inform himself more on the therapeutic aspect of ketamine therapy and RELEARN HOW TO PLACE IVs before taking on new clients. Ketamine is not just a medication that automatically cures depression, it requires very delicate set up, conditions, and energy for the session to make a positive impact. Until then, I can not, in good faith, recommend this location to anyone requiring a new provider for ketamine therapy, one (moderately traumatizing) session was $450 by the way, $500 regular price. I feel quite fortunate that it did not impact me negatively, but I feel for my past self or a more mentally unstable individual it could be quite a tragedy.|Dr. Brian is most caring. He gives you options and explains everything so you understand your options. RFA's, Epidural, etc.|Was made to take a drug test first visit that costs $50, I've broke my back and have a cage a spinal fusion in my lower back. I worked at a labor intensive job to pay for this. Then was refused medication because I told them I have abused alcohol in my past for both my pain and anxiety and it's ruined my life and I don't want to keep living like that, but my pain is not going to disappear. In the end they don't care if im trying to recieve medication from a doctor so I can stop self medicating. I pray that God can help these doctors out with whatever is going on in their lives  and what is to come because I honestly think they need more help and guidance in their life than me.|Dr. Hassan and Dr. Perera are the best pain management Dr's in the area!

Today my appointment is at 1115a. I get here and the office is full of patients while the staff is arguing about who does what and what's not getting done there are 6+ patients waiting to be seen or checked in. Then 1 with pink or purple hair tells all the patients after waiting for 30 mins and all seats are full that all in the triage area have to move in the rudest of ways . We are people in pain who don't move well or fast and your office is full and you close at noon. I took off from work to come to this appointment.  No one here values your time as a patient. I've NEVER been here less than 2 hrs waiting to be seen. If I didn't need the services  my meds and planned therapy I'd be gone.

It is COMPLETELY worth it. They are the best! Updating. I've been a patient here going on three years. They are honest. Dr. Von Tobel I'd one of the best doctors I've ever had. Danni is a complete angel. I've never had a problem with and staff there. Just to sum it up. I love them. Mrs. Melissa in authorization is a wonderful person. The share an office with a nerve specialist group and they are great as well. The welcome each other's clients like they're there own. If you are in severe pain or suffer from chronic pain and don't want to have surgery. Give these guys a go. They will never bull crap you and tell you things even though it maybe hard to say.

One of the best educated and thorough pain treatment doctors one could have. With a pathology background he is versed in much more than only pain management. Recommend 100 % as is the staff with Ricardo running the show.|My visit with Dr. Reyes went very, very well. He gave me a Thorough examination and took the time to answer  all of my questions concerning  treatment.   I also was very impressed  with all of the staff  Who treated me with kindness and respect  and  patience. I have decided to have Dr. Reyes as my primary doctor going forward. I know I am in good hands. Thanks to all!|Dr. Reyes is the most competent and compassionate in his field. He is so wonderful and knowledgeable that you immediately feel at ease. I would trust him with any procedure and will continue to follow him. The young man who assists him is equally competent and thorough in his job! Together they are a winning team!|I was in and out within minutes. Didn't ask me anything about my history. Acted like I wasn't even there. Never in my life by a dr have I felt like I was an annoyance. I was told it was pain management and to bring my bottles from my previous doctor..They told me he would do injections, medicine, and anything else I needed. My primarily set my appt up so I'd get medicine on my last day. He didn't care I was out of medicine. He told me to go back to my previous pm dr. I switched bc I couldn't afford the out of pocket appointments at previous doctor and resolute takes my insurance. Bc of chemo I'm basically broke.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I will be sure to bring awareness to this place that's run more like you're just a number than a patient LIVESTRONG|I recently went to my first appointment and i was so impressed with everyone in the office from the doctor to the receptionist, they are pleasant, helpful, and professional. I was in a room and seeing Dr. Reyes within 15 minutes of my appointment time and he addressed all of my concerns and came up with a treatment plan that i feel good about! I  will definitely recommend my family and friends!|I have been going to doctor Reyes for a few years. T
past year during the covid-19 out break, I helped one of my neighbors get up off of the floor as He had fell.

Dr Reyes had never seen me like that before crying so hard& in that type , of horrific pain.

I couldn't put any weight on my feet ! Was in a Wheel Chair!!

He went to work right away to get me an emergency referral for injections .

I have had the injections and my back intermittently since 2001.

I had stopped getting injections a few years ago as I had very minimal results IF any?

He gave me the lower injections the following day .

I able to WALK out of the Office!

I really feel like it was a miracle &  the results have been very long lasting!

I would highly highly recommend Dr. Reyes for..ANY...services, he could do for you, to help you!

He is very compassionate and cares about each Person's needs an individual basis .

**MOST DOCTORS DO NOT MEET HISE HIGH STANDARD  OF PRACTICE**

Debi Brand ( Retired Nurse).|After never really knowing anything about chronic pain until I was struck by a car crossing the street, my physicians recommended that I needed to see a pain specialist due to the extent of my injuries. I chose Dr. Reyes based on all the excellent feedback people wrote about him on Google and once I had an appointment and met with him for the first time I thought that the reviews were seriously understated and did not even begin to tell how unbelievably awesome this Doctor really is. My first intake appointment he spent over 3 hours examinaing me and even finding things out that the other Dr's didn't even ever pick up on. He is a very kind, intelligent, caring man with an unbelievable wealth of knowledge in his field of experience. He explains everything to you in a manner that your able to understand him. He's not one of those Dr's that only want to see you for 5-10 minutes and write you a bunch of scripts and send you on your way. He really listens to all of what you relay to him and does a good job at pinpointing the types of medical treatments or medicine that you would benefit from the best. He's not there to load you up with a bunch of pain meds to cover up the pain, he rather use other forms and techniques that are in my opinion much more effective and helpful with my condition and I let him know that I want to be on lowest dose of pain medicine possible so I'm able to function and he said that the less pain medicine is the best course of treatment. So far I've only been seeing him for a little while and like any other specialist you need time to find the correct medicine and treatments that benefit you the best and I think we are just about there. He provided me a new treatment when I last saw him and after filling it and using it I was able to walk without use of my cane for first time, then was able to go for a nice long refreshing night walk that was about 8 miles and didn't feel a ounce of pain, not even after going to bed and waking up the next morning. I'd also like to commend his staff for their professionalism, politeness, kindness, extreme helpfulness and again truly caring about the patients they treat. All in all I would say everyone working there goes above and beyond what is necessary in every single way possible. It's a dog gone shame that all Doctor's offices out there could not be as superior as I feel this one is when it comes down to true and actual patient care. It's blatantly obvious that money is not even on their radar as a mitigating factor of why they are in business, you can immediately tell that it is all about them caring and wanting the people who go there to truly get the assistance to live a better life and be able to do simple thiings that may feel debating to someone in chronic pain, so the patients quality of life greatly improves. I lucked out blindly choosing Dr. Reyes from a very long list of similar specialists in the Fort Lauderdale Area, but I am so great-full that in this case it was really good luck that I wound up finding out after meeting him and beginning to work with him. I would love to have given the Google rating a heck more than just 5 stars cuz that does not even come close to giving this facility the proper recognition it truly deserves. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a Dr. who takes the time to listen and your well being is first and foremost to his patients and I really wish there were many more other types of Dr's and specialists like Dr. Reyes out there. It would make just enough difference in one facet of people's lives that they could feel good about obtaining medical care and not have to worry about the Dr. having a God complex or strictly in it for the money and they charge you a small fortune to see them for 15 minutes and hardly anything you'd like gets accomplished cuz they are just rushing you out for the next person to come in. I'm really glad I ended up here and hope that this review helps other's to choose this facility in the event that they also need to be seen by this type of specialist, you won't and be disappointed.|Dr. Leo Reyes is my pain management doctor who has lots of experience helping people with chronic pain such as myself.

He didn't just shove a pain pill script at me, and that, in itself, let me know I was seeing the right doctor! He is working with me to find a solution to my pain. Some clinics see you have severe pain so they give you pills and send you on your way, but I actually feel like he cares. I've told him, and his staff that I didn't want pills, I wanted to real solution. I  will admit, he is definitely a character, but that's one thing that will always keep me coming to him.
Here's why I left off a star. The girl at the front desk seems like it bothers her to do her job. Almost like she's annoyed by people coming in for their appointments. She's never been friendly to anyone I've seen her interact with. Whatever you do, don't try to ask her question outside of handing her paperwork or money.
There is one lady that usually checks me out and sets my next appointments and she is super sweet. The rest of the staff has been good to me.
Overall, if you can't get past the front, the people behind the doors are pretty great, especially the doctor. I hope this helps someone as I gave a very honest, straightforward opinion. This place is definitely worth it|I have been a patient of Dr. Joseph for many years. He is very compassionate and I always enjoy when I get to see him. He is very knowledgeable about alternative treatments and I appreciate that he has shared this knowledge with me on many visits. Instead of prescription meds, I have been able to treat my arthritis with Turmeric Curcumin. He is always striving to make his practice better for patients.|Teresa is a very friendly and  thorough Nurse Practitioner ! She is the best in the office and I hope I can continue to see only her! The staff is great as well! As far as Dr. Joseph, I have seen him around five times and we have not had a decent conversation yet. His visits last about two minutes with me if that long. Some people can't connect and he and I can not!! I have learned nothing about my health problems from him. I will stick with Teresa because She shows concern and listens and talks to me about my problems with my pain!|Dr. Joseph is a caring and good doctor. I had injection in my neck I didn't feel a thing,gives excellent injections and I still have relief after 3 weeks. For me is unusual. Highly recommend Dr. Joseph|Super knowledgeable and always answers any questions I may have.
I see Teresa, she is absolutely the best, listens and explains my aches and pains.
This office has kept me upright and moving for several years.|I have used Dr. Joseph and Teresa fir a few years now. Awsome people treat you with compassion....and understanding. Had ablation a couple weeks ago...woke up Mon morning screaming in pain. Could not use my right leg at all. Call..left a message. Young lady called me back and informed me there was no way to see the Dr till my regular scheduled appointment. I was instructed to go to ER. I did....the next day pain was still excruciating....young lady stated that Dr. Joseph was booked and Teresa out of the country. I am in sever pain and she sounded as she could really not care.  Totally shocked. Never been treated this way from Dr. Josrph office. So I lay here with pain pills from ER (I preferred not to have) and Ice packs praying for relief.
Update a week later....
Made a appointment with Hughston Clinic. Got in immediately.  Got approval for MRI in 2 days. WOW. usually takes weeks. These Dr's. do not play around. NURSES are kind and extremely concerned. Think alot of Dr. Joseph and Teresa but the middle man...(nurse) persuaded me to go get help else where when she could care less when I was crying and begging for help and her response was Dr. Joseph is book and Teresa is out of town.. not willing to take a message or have Dr.Joseph to call me back.|The staff was very pleasant and professional.

Ida L|From the scheduling of the appointment to check in the service and professionalism was outstanding.  At my first appointment, the nurse, Erica was thorough in gathering my history and the background for my visit. She then took me to see Lauren Gold the P.A. Ms. Gold was exceptional and had already reviewed much of my recent medical history. She was so knowledgeable and had made suggestions that she planned to review with Dr. Levine. She left the exam room and returned a short time later with Dr. Levine, who was also thoroughly versed in my health history.
Over the last 3 years I've been treated by numerous specialists across many Healthcare systems. Many providers gave me 5-10 minutes of their time, and knew little about my health history at the appointment. Often, I felt as though those provider's didn't try to understand and correct the  source of my health concern, they just wanted to treat the treat my symptoms.
Dr. Levine, Ms. Lauren Gold P.A. and their nurse, Erica made feel as though they cared! Their confidence in their treatment plan following their review of my health created renewed hope, after three years of numerous disappointments. Excellent experience, and I highly recommend Pain Care of Florida in Stuart.|I am no longer a patient with this firm, & yes, I am a little disgruntled. Here is my issue. I've had a spinal issue for over 50 years that requires me to take NORCO to relieve the pain. This office requires people who take strong medication take a urine test every 3 months. It is not a Florida law they do this, but I do understand their need to find out who is abusing the need for painkillers. I went from monthly visits to once every 3 to 4 months (this is usually when I run out of medication). One again they asked me to take a urine test after 4 months & I had taken a urine test on my last visit. BTW, these urine tests are conducted by an in-house lab, of which is not covered by my medical insurance (I don't know about others). Upon further investigation, I have found no information that ""Mobile Anesthesia Associates"" (which performs the test) is a certified lab. Paincare does not require you take a urine test via a certified lab before your next appointment. IMO these charges are unethical & against my principals.|Today I saw Lauren Gold APRN.

They also help with financial assistance for those in need. All I can say is thank you for caring about those of us who are going through very difficult life altering times.|Read this review carefully before getting any services from this office. I was involved in a car accident and was under treatment through a different clinic. I was referred by my attorney because apparently they have used them in the past. On my first visit, I was basically greeted by the receptionist and the doctor himself Dr. Xavier. Basically rushed me through the paperwork requesting signatures and didn't really go into detail of the procedure. Feeling pressure and rushed, I signed all documents requested. After the treatment, which I felt very uncomfortable, I requested for it to be the last treatment. They insisted that I needed to treat at least once more. I contacted my attorney and explained the situation and they said to try to follow the doctors directions since he was the professional. I had no choice but to follow the directions.  Once I walked in to the office, the doctor said that if I wanted to be the last treatment, that he would do two treatments that day so I wouldn't have to return. Apparently the doctor had found out the limits on the policy we were going after from the accident and said: ""your case is looking very good"". Once we walked in, I felt like they did a lot more than what they were supposed to. I felt horrible for several weeks after that and apparently they tried to exhaust all the funds from the limits on our case against our other party. I'm only sharing my experience so you are extremely careful when coming into this office. Dr. Xavier is not concerned for your health and is simply going after any money he can get from insurance companies. Not sure how he is still in business but I will not recommend him to anyone at all after my experience in his office. Be aware and consult your attorney or other specialists prior to agreeing doing treatment with them.|Doctor Xavier and his staff are fast and professional. They make sure everything gets done and explains after and in a timely matter. Very Happy with Dr Xavier and his friendly staff.|Best staff and experience I've had!  After 6 back surgeries, and a car accident, Meg did a great job assisting me with insurance issues, getting the injections timely, and properly.|Don't even bother. If you call asking if they do certain procedures or if you need to keep searching you'll just get berated by someone who I assume was the doctor after the receptionist passed the phone to him.

I was charged as a first time patient 300$, and nothing no urine, no exam, no mri was done as if I was a first time patient, beings I was seen a few months prior I guess they just wanted a fast cash collection from a patient they knew they could not help. I have been perscribed 120 15mg oxy, probably due to the fact I am allergic to Tylenol, and the fact I am in a wheelchair due to AVN in my hips. These people knew of such information, and after excepting my 300$ told me they will try to write something close if not better because of my pain level. After that it took 4 days of calling back an fourth hunting down this prescription they wrote, with no clue of what was written. The first script written was send to North Carolina , still to this day I do not understand why. Then it took three days to fix the location of the script, by the time I located this script, it was 4 almost 5 days of being sick from being dependent on this medication, and I then found out I was written 90 10/325, almost half of what I have been perscribed the past 4 months prior. So it was all pretty much a scam to receive my 300$ an say they did something so they did not have to give me my money back witch I asked for the first three days prior, after being very unhappy an I voiced this for 3 days......so I'm writting this a second time, because it seems they removed my first review I guess hiding what truly happen an what they do to patient's they can not help. Instead of saying we can not match your prior doctor an giving my money back, they sold me a dream an had me wait almost a week for something that I am allergic too|This clinic has always answered all of my questions and concerns.

After my fall I asked for an incident report, guy that helped me off the floor asked me, "" for what""? When I felt steady enough I left the office hurting far worse than I came. Awhile later, I came back for another treatment.I talked to the doctor about the fall, and I never saw or heard from him again, at one point I called the office but never got a return call.I felt then and I feel now I should be compensated for my pain and suffering, January 9, 2025 will be 2 years the MOST AWEFUL EXPERIENC, so please be careful, the Assistant should have been standing on the side of me, I never should've been asked to get up without assistance after a procedure like that, it was NEGIIGENT, and the ONLY ONE SUFFERED WAS ME, the patient|First time that I went there.

When my husband and I arrived at her office on the morning of his appointment we were told very abruptly that she was no longer treating patients with pain pumps. It was totally unprofessional and very disrespectful especially since the appointment was confirmed the day before. I do not understand how a doctors office can be so unreliable. I wouldn't recommend her or her offices. That is no way to treat anyone.|Dr. Sharma and staff are so amazing! It's not often you find an office where BOTH the Doctor and staff are great,  but this one is the exception. Everyone is so thoughtful and caring.  From the moment you walk in,
you feel that.  The wait time was non existent, yet Dr. Sharma spends time to really get to know your issues.  She HEARS you and conveys that she cares. I have been to many doctors due to MS, and  I feel that this office is the best I have ever been to.  In a world where most offices are part of huge parent companies, this office gives you that feeling of the family doctor that knows and cares about their patients. I highly recommend this office for anyone that has unresolved pain issues. I am blessed to have found them.|I loved my former pain management doctor, and didn't want to lose him, however, I'm very pleased with Dr Sharma and the staff. Dr Sharma is kind, professional, and really listens. Thank you!|This doctor's (Dr Sharma) office is truly the best I have been to since my cancer began, 4 years ago.  Trust me I have had my share of Drs!  I have had more than a few that I left because the service was awful, especially front desk who should be the first to provide empathy! It's not like we are there to buy a burger.
This office, I am so humble to say that from the moment you enter, till the moment you leave (with pain and all) you are smiling.  Dr. Sharma prescribed pain meds that worked until Ins approved the procedure.
Fast forward, I had the procedure & yesterday was my follow up & I was so happy to visit my Dr. Sharma who scheduled another treatment and I've never been soooo happy since my cancer journey began.  Cancer is awful but what's worse is the damage treatments do to your body.
Dr. Sharma/staff if you are reading this, THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!!
Elizabeth C|Dr. Kavita Sharma is a very caring person/doctor who totally cares about her patients. She is in no rush with you and takes her time to sit and talk with you about everything. She explains everything to you and truly cares!! I would highly recommend her to anyone who needs help.... She takes her oath to heart, and now a days that's a very rare occasion. God bless her for taking care of me|Dr Lee is a great listener who proposes remedies AND asks me what I think. He has helped me a lot. The office staff is always nice and appointments are made in a reasonable time. The wait has never been bad.|Dr. Sharma was thorough and told me everything that she was going to do. She is very sweet and caring. I would definitely recommend her to anyone that needs pain management.|I am a medical professional and had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Lee who is the new Pain Management Physician in this office. Dr. Lee is personable, professional, well trained and extremely knowledgeable.  I presented with a bursitis in my right hip that Dr. Lee immediately diagnosed and fit me into his busy schedule for an immediate injection to relieve my discomfort.

His injections are flawless, I believe his ARNP is Janine, she is very compassionate and has plethora of knowledge. The staff has always been great, there's a young man downstairs at the Ft Myers office that is always eager to help and patient with even the most rude people. With every good review there is a bad one. Melynda . No empathy only apathy. Talked down to me in a way I've never experienced in a medical facility . Rude , condescending, she's angry , on my way out she was treating staff like children. I was treated like a drug seeker by simply asking what were some medication options , I've been in pain mgmt for several years.
Minimized my pain without looking at all my MRI reports. Saying things like oh it's not too bad , it's just a ""small"" herniated disc. These are subjective complaints, the real problem was falsifying my medical records. She left the room and came back within 3 minutes with her typed up version of my appt. Saying she examined me, she never touched me. Put down she scolded me for being on benzodiazepines without authorization I'm not on that med it's never been prescribed . Saying she warned me to stop taking more than the daily dose of my medication or I could be kicked out of pain mgmt, I told her I often feel like I need to take more but I don't. I'm worried that this false information could hurt me in the future with anything medical related , I'm a disable combat Vet the VA is very strict I could lose benefits if I'm believed to be a drug abuser. It's unethical to carelessly put false info in a medical record. Avoid this PA-C . I'm only writing the review to warn people, I'm not looking for admonishment.|Kirsti Hoag went beyond the call of duty to reschedule my appointment that was cancelled and put me on a waiting list. She called later that same day and was able to get spot even earlier. It's not just that... it's her sincerity and presence of mind when I arrived. Her kindness will be remembered by me...

I so wish, that there were more like her and Dr. Mahaney's staff in the healthcare industry. This world seems to have forgotten that that level of humanity only breeds more unselfishness. I left the office with hope because Kirsti and the staff have such heart and I think it put a slight glow in mine.

I look SO forward to being pain-free.|Been trying for 3 days to cancel my appointment for February 6th. Because I am a new patient they keep telling me I had to go through different people. Was connected to 3 different people and they still refused to cancel my appointment. Told me that I had to be connected to a 4th person. I got pissed off after being on the phone 25 minutes and hung up. Just  better not charge me if I don't show up or they will see me in court and pay me for my aggravation.I have worked in the medical field and this is not the way to treat a new patient.|I had a total hip replacement on 10/23 by Dr. Alden. From the very beginning of the process of deciding to move forward with plans for surgery, Dr. Alden and his staff took time to answer my questions and communicate next steps. My recovery after surgery went well, and I would highly recommend Dr. Alden if you are considering hip replacement. It is only 7 weeks past surgery and I feel like I have my life back! Thank you Dr. Alden!|I have being seeing Dr Micovic for about 3 years.  I love him. I recently had a pain stimulator put in. That really has not went as we hoped for. Dr Micovic is a great doctor,  but then I was told I needed to see the ARNP, that I couldn't see Dr Micovic,  all after a pain stimulator implant. Well she was horrible to say it the nice way.  And now about the past 3 to 6  months forget talking to someone when you call and need something. My prescriptions are not sent in, prior authorization are not done, you go without medication. You see a doctor and you discuss your medication and he says he will send them. Well forget that and then no one will answer or call and help you. I saw him Tuesday at 8am, it's Friday evening and no medication at the pharmacy. And the staff are just down right rude and nasty these days. They are causing more stress on me and making my condition worse. Due to this even though I have an awesome doctor, I am now looking for another clinic due to the staff. And this happens 3 months after the doctor implants a device in my back. I'm not happy with this at all. And because of the on going issues with the staff I do not recommend this clinic. Doctor is great,  but you have to have a great TEAM to go with it or it just doesn't work.
Very sad things have come to this point.|Absolutely my best medical experience. From the extremely knowledgeable Dr. Acosta to his professional staff, I continue to experience terrific visits.|Dr.  Acosta is the best pain management doctor I have ever had! Been with him four years and still he treats me with the upmost respect. He is professional and spends the time I need to answer the questions I have! Never ever feel rushed! The girls at the front desk are always pleasant. Nick, his right hand man is just so personable and helpful makes me feel comfortable and I have never seen him without a smile! I could not be happier there! I would give them a ten if I could! Thank You Dr. Acosta|I am a life enrichment director at a local retirement home.

One receptionist working with a patient trying to work on appointment dates. Towards the end, an employee came from the back area to talk to that receptionist about an appointment for another man who was in the back room.
By the time the receptionist acknowledged me, it was 15 minutes past my appointment time.
Now she says I'm late, might not be seen, goes to the back, tells me to wait, then says I can be seen at an afternoon time the same day.
1. 6 minutes late originally, and reception with a patient going back and forth with appointments.
2. Only 1 receptionist at front during this time.
3. Seems like you wait in the office at least 10 to 15 minutes before going to a room in the back to wait again for 5+ minutes. All after your scheduled appointment.
4. If your seeing a PA, it's a 3 to 5 minute visit. Why turn the patient away?
This place needs better management,  and train the receptionist staff to be nicer and realize things can happen and be more compassionate to patients in pain.
In all the years going to doctors, this receptionist staff is the worst I have encountered and needs better training. The way they speak to patients is deplorable.|Don't go to this place, they don't give a shit about pain management. If you have emergency work done for teeth or an emergency room vosit for pain they  will report you across the state for abusing drugs and shut you off completely  This is what they do to elderly people who have heart issues, had emergency tooth extractions and a knee replacements.  Make sure you get all your urine work from them for proof.|I saw Dr Jay Kuchera 2 weeks ago. I was greated with such compassion and understanding of my current situation. Dr Jay Kuchera thoroughly explained everything to me. I wish all doctors were as kind as him. I look forward to seeing him and his kind office staff again.|Rating it a 1 is a step up treated me awful
Pt  care .... Dr took me in a room far away wanting me to talk to state people about meds that are crazy and put you through the mill treat you like an addict !!!
I'm 67 my back is gone don't waste your time !!!|Everyone here at this location is very professional and helpful.  Dr. Warsch and his staff have helped me tremendously.  I was bedridden for a month with my back and he has done two injections in my back and it's like night and day and in two weeks will be doing radiation abalation which should  help even more.  I would like to thank his assistant and Heather and Cheryl.  You have helped me so much with my head pain, shoulder pain and back pain.  I highly recommend you to anyone who is looking for relief.  I have so much faith in you that when we move to N.C. I would drive back here to see you because I trust you.  Thank you again|I've been going here for a little over a year now and I have always been treated professionally. It starts the minute I step up to the check in desk and there is Delores who always greets me with a smile and asks how I'm doing, then when I go to a room the girl's who take my blood pressure, to finally the Doctor or Nurse, wether it's for an Injection or to get my medication refilled everyone is always nice and polite. My only dislike would be the wait to get into a room (pretty much like any other Doctor's office) but on more than 1 occasion my wait has been over an hour! They did keep apologizing and the reason was the Nurse or Doctor I had the appt. for called out. But overall they had treated me very well.|IN Pain BEWARE!!!.. It's important to share my feedback to others can be aware of the challenges will be faced with PAIN CARE a month ago. I am looking to emphasize my feelings strongly that, PAIN CARE, DOESN'T CARE. I want to stress how deeply disappointed I am with the care provided by PAIN CARE. They consistently fail to answer calls, rely on impersonal voicemail, and exhibit terrible bedside manners. Their communication is secretive and lacks follow-up, leaving patients in unnecessary pain and mental anguish. It feels like they prioritize profit over patient well-being, blaming regulations instead of providing compassionate care. This isn't my first experience with pain management, but it's certainly the worst. Doctors should be in this profession to heal, not to neglect otherwise fine another job. Not all practices are like this, though. I must commend the Front Desk, which deserves recognition for their professionalism, earning 4 stars in my book.|Pain Care Florida (formerly Resolute) has helped me for several years now. I would not be able to function without their care. The doctors, PA's and staff are very thorough with pain issues and treatment. After trying different medications over time I finally found what gives me the best relief along with laying down to take pressure off my back. Be sure to read all the paperwork and guidelines to be sure you can comply.

Chiquita was so mad that I called her on her mistake she yelled at me like a dog.  I said excuse me and I'd like to speak to a dr or a nurse.  She yelled at me and I was
 told to leave and they fired me as a patient.  Just like that, they don't care about you there or the office manager should be fired.  I've never been treated that way in my life and I refuse to be treated that way.  I rather suffer in pain then be spoke to like that.  I consider this place a pill mill.  If you are quite and allow Chiquita to treat you with such disrespect, shame on everyone that works there.  No one spoke up after at least 10 people saw her yell at me.  Chiquita should be fired!

I would definitely refer friends and family for the quality care they treat you with. This office had made my life better by reducing my back pain by performing procedures to decreasing this pain. Thank you so much! I feel very comfortable and safe with Dr Erickson !|Dr. Nancy really listens to you and tries to find all the ways possible to get you back to 100%. She's super welcoming and  I love that she recommends vitamins that help with things as well instead of just big pharm pills. She really cares about her patients and you can tell. Also the front desk staff and the MAs are super welcoming and amazing. 100/10 if i could. Best doctor i've had so far and i've only had one visit so far. Also love that her faith is so strong. you can feel it the moment you walk into the office and as a christian myself it's very awesome and heartwarming to see.

Only complaint i have though is i went in on wednesday (11/27/24) and they were going to send medication for my pain( have severe back pain due to a horrible car accident i had in 2015 where they had to dig me out of the car). Well i called the pharmacy and no medications were called in. and then i called the office but due to it being after 4:30 i got the after hours lady and she said i had to wait till monday (12/2/24)

So i went 5 days in 9/10-10/10 pain due to my medication not being called in. And mind you my appt was at 9:30am.But i understand we are human and mistakes happen.

Aside from that amazing staff and an amazing provider.|As usual everyone was caring and professional with a smile . Gaelle was very kind and considerate showing her concern about my pain spasms. DJ Linder, Dr. Erickson's assistant was understanding and helpful ,  finding a way to expedite my medication requests.
Thank you for all you do, I'm so glad to be a patient of Paincare Florida. Many blessings to all.|Mom has stage 4 gastric cancer with a liver metastasis, we went to many pain management doctors and none were able to help her. I finally made an appointment with Erickson and she understood from day one, from day 1 she adjusted and increased everything for mom. She understood certain medications didn't cover as much as doctors thought. She added and subtracted a few, and mom now is able to enjoy life a little more and better. She's active again, that was her main concern. Although we know her days are counted, we also know that God is in control and what better than to have a provider who not only cares for her patients, but also prays for her patients.
Dr. Erickson has been a true blessing to mom and all of us as a family.

Thank you, Dr. Erickson !|Dr. Erickson is a great person and a wonderful doctor.  I know her as a patient for more than 15 yrs. She cares about her patients and explains everything that's going to take place if you choose to stay awake during the pain injection process and not get anesthesia during a procedure. Frankly, in my opinion it's better to opt to be awake because the whole process take 3 to 5 seconds.  It's a bit uncomfortable but quickly goes away within nano seconds. Otherwise, you have to follow the process as if you had full blown surgery. It takes more time for the prep with pre-op than the actual procedure. You can't eat or drink after midnight and can't drive yourself to and from the hospital. The heart undressed to have an I V so they can give you the anesthesia. Then come out have a snack get dressed and wait for someone to drive you home. This all takes between 2 to 4 hours depending on how many patients that day and where you are inline for the O R.
Without anesthesia it's done in the office for the time it takes having a regular visit. Even if you have to go to outpatient surgical centers onto insurance coverage, it's still much quicker because there's no prep time.
Dr Erickson uses a machine called the Florescope which tells her how well the medication took throughout your targeted area of pain. So it's very precise. She's witty, & wise.
She jokes around and makes you feel comfortable.
Dr. Erickson also suggests some wholistic ways to curtail pain as well.   If your consistent in attendance and follow
Dr. Erickson suggestions, you will maintain a tolerable level to function better on a day to day basis.|Great experience always staff very professional and attentive to patients needs Dr Nancy Erickson is an awesome doctor always satisfied with service!",2025-02-26|2025-01-08|2024-07-03|2024-12-02|2024-10-07|2024-09-10|2025-02-13|2025-01-07,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,long_wait_times|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|physical_therapy|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJz_QTxDqn2YgRtJI96S2bN-k,146

I will recommend this clinic. Changing my score.|I cannot say a bad word  abt him   I have been seeing him for almost 5 yrs.  I have seen many pain management doctors before and hated to be on these narcotis because that's all they do.  I have severe back pain and RSD of my left ankle.  I even told him he cannot retire or die because I cannot survive without his treatment.    He is actually training his son.  That is a plus.  He has become friends with my hubby outside of work. But that does not impact me at all except that I admire him for the compassionate, professional man he is.  And his wife is an Angel from above.

However, in my case , I had no choice cause no one else accepted my insurance. So I decided to give them a try and thankfully, they have been great so far. I'm not to happy about having  to always pay for a urine test when THEY need my urine, but it is what it is. The girls up front in the reception area are very nice and professional. The doctors are also great. Especially when explaining things. I didn't feel rushed and was well taken care of. I would definitely recommend this office if anyone is looking for a pain management.|I am a 71 year old disabled woman that has been using pain management  for around 30 years. Florida Medical has been the best out of every where I have been. Everyone there is kind, accommodating, informative and like family to me. They make sure to check how much your condition has changed over time which is important for proper treatment. I would recommend them to anyone with pain problems.|I am extremely happy with the outstanding care and great customer service that I have received at Florida Medical Pain Management over the past two years. They explain everything in great detail and follow up with you post procedure. The office and surgical areas are immaculate. Furthermore, they are extremely accommodating and ensure you get an appointment very quickly. I highly recommend them to my family and friends.|This place was a waste of time and money, I live in Spring Hill, they told me the day before my appointment time which I had to wait 2 weeks for to see a Real  doctor and not a PA.
Because their doctor decided not to show, I had to drive to New Port Richey supposedly to see a doctor.   I was charged $50 for  urine test and pay my copay.
After seeing the PA instead of a doctor which they promised, he told me I had to talk to a psychologist which was another $60 co-pay.
Do you only reason for talking to a psychologist is if they were going to give you pain medicin and shots.
After talking with the psychologist. He recommended pain medicine, just not as much as I was originally taken.
However, just to find out what they were going to give me I had to make another appointment For another $60 to see somebody in Spring Hill.  When I got there the PA Told me Stephen, the PA in Newport Richy did not recommend pain medicine.

So they were just willing to give me shots.
Personally, I think they're crooks,  Why did I have to pay for a urine test? Why did I have to pay for a psychologist? and why did have to make a 3rd Appointment to see another PA that I can't get relief.

If shots work for u and u don't need a real doctor, go for it but this place just looks for ways of charging you.
Ps.  I had to drive to New Port Richey twice and when I got there the 2nd time which is almost an hour they canceled my appointment and set me up for the Spring Hill office.

I would love to go after them for the urine test and the psychologist appointment.
Apparently they knew ahead of time, and I did not need either test.

I hope this helps people,
Kathy|Horrible experience. I started going there and after several appointments then they set up injections which I had to do two test sets of after I did the first I had called in to check on a refill on my prescription for pain meds and I spoke to the office manager and she canceled my appointment when I made no such request. When I showed up for my appointment for my next injection they said, ""oh your appointment was canceled"" they never called me and told me that the appointment was canceled and then I was upset because they did this and I was told that the office manager did it which upset me even more since I never mentioned canceling my appointment and I asked if the calls were recorded and the person I spoke to said yes, they were. A few days later I got a letter or an email from them saying that I was discharged from the practice and nobody called me back about my experience there I will never go to this place again I would not recommend it to anybody who does not want to be mistreated.|The Dr office staff The nurses are awesome they help you with questions about paperwork and questions about your conditions they explain what procedures they are going to do going home instruction I'll recommend them to anyone the office bathroom patient waiting room the whole office is nice and clean and smells great keep up the good work|I don't like being bullied either they change your appointments say they called  and you never received anything.

Dr. Azeem has assembled a great team of front office staff and caring, focused providers.  I appreciate that they have a partnership with the VA. It has allowed me to access great quality care near my home in Riverview.

A plus is the upbeat music  flowing through .
Keep up the great work!|My spinal issues started 23 years ago and so at this point it's my entire spine and it affects all of my limbs. I started seeing Dr Azeem almost a year ago and within that time he and his staff have done so much to help me have a better life. From steroid injections to RFA procedures and sciatic nerve injections have really done so much to improve my lower back and legs. I am so happy that I found Dr Azeem and his team. I Thank you all for helping me.|I had an amazing experience with Florida Spine.  They were attentive to my needs and took good care of me.  I would recommend their services to anyone.|The office and everyone  working there were welcoming, courteous and helpful.   Dr. Azeem was fully engaged with me and spent a great deal of time discussing my issues and explaining possible procedures  to address my two spinal issues....after the MRI he ordered.  The doctor is extremely knowledgeable  in understanding the root of my problems.   I left his office with hope for the future, which I have not felt for quite some time.|I gave this a three star because of the long wait time sitting in the waiting room. My appt. was at 2pm I arrived 15 minutes early, as told by office, but did not get called in until after 3pm. To me, it's stressful enough going to see a new doctor, plus the stress of losing time and pay from being away from work longer than expected. No one needs the added stress of waiting 1.5 hrs to be called in to see a doctor.

Despite the long wait, Dr Azeem was awesome. He was very informative about possible procedures to help with the issue at hand. He was kind, respectful and even funny at times. My experience with him was great! The staff, including his medical assistant were very friendly and helpful.

I am returning to the office for a procedure. I do hope they get me in sooner than last time.|Very dissatisfied with the care and professionalism. After four months of chronic back pain and doing physical therapy as directed (without improving) they still refuse to do injections. Nomen Azeem first told me that we could do
the injections for a long term fix, then on the follow-up appointment he went back on it. They seem to be more interested in growing their business rather than actually help people.|I had an extremely negative experience at Dr. Nomen Azeem's clinic staff receptionist and PT. on March 14 . As a new patient in severe pain, I expected understanding and assistance, but instead, I was met with rudeness and indifference.
The receptionist, Alena, was uncooperative and argumentative when I failed to correctly complete the online paperwork, which I received just minutes before my appointment. Instead of explaining the procedure, she treated me with disdain, rolling her eyes and becoming defensive. Another staff member joined in, escalating the situation further, and the receptionist even laughed at me. after trying to de-escalate the situation by asking for her manager she said wasn't at this office and wouldn't give me her name. She told the staff I didn't want to fill out the online paperwork?  When I just had a question about not filling it out correctly. It was insane im still in shock.

The physical therapist, who was supposed to help me, was uninformed about my situation. He said I needed to apologize to the receptionist, despite not witnessing the encounter. And that the manager will be calling me this was at 10 not a soul has called. I was crying and in so much pain I was so excited to get PT and was going to have surgery now I'm just shocked that his staff doesn't have the patience for a severely in pain person. I'm not on medication because I chose a clinic that didn't give you medication.

This ordeal left me feeling even more distressed and in pain. The lack of empathy and understanding, particularly from a clinic specializing in pain management, was appalling. I left feeling like a burden rather than a patient.

Despite the reputation of Dr. Azeem, the behavior of the staff is inexcusable. A pain clinic should have employees who understand and empathize with patients, not those who treat them with disdain. I was left in more pain due to the stress of this encounter and would strongly advise others to avoid this clinic.

As I sat with the PT who has no idea despite the online paperwork and my appt on March 12 and my (information mri etc ) I thought this is who I will be dealing with if I get the surgery. I left feeling like I wanted to die cause it was abusive. The receptionist smiled cause she knew I was the one who was leaving and she was happy and laughed back to any camera. I was crying as I got into my car. Sad that this is his staff. Which after surgery that's who you deal with. I understand I was in severe pain but anyone who knows me knows I'm a kind person I am writing this cause I don't want a soul to be bullied and feel like I did and I'm sorry I wish this Dr knew how horrible his staff was and how they don't understand pain patients at all.  I'm so glad they showed me over her misunderstanding who they were. I spoke with a professional who works in this industry and he was floored. He knows me well. He said that's borderline abuse. I understand misunderstandings and such but I was told to apologize and not a soul but me and this very unkind unfriendly receptionist were the only two that were in the room far away from others.  I was warned it was on camera ?! To be honest I'm still in shock
Sadly this is the way they operate.  You'll love the Dr and his pa. But remember after the surgery you are dealing with a staff who doesn't care and no matter what you do isn't about the patient who is paying their salary but about themselves.  That's the worst thing in my 52 years I've ever experienced ever.  Ever.  Writing this for others. And I pray he gets new staff members. I'm not okay from it all at all. I'm in more pain and feel like I was abused.

Patients in extreme pain may not always be 100 percent on every level. And they should understand this. I only wanted to ask her if I should give him my personal paperwork.   yelled and bullied by Staff members which was beyond anything I've ever experienced. she thought I was complaining about the online paperwork? and I was just trying to help the PT who in return and was never there and told me I owe her an apology.horrific experience|I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Azeem and Nurse Practitioner Ashley for their invaluable support in the restoration of my quality of life. With a decade spent dedicated to the demanding field of emergency medicine followed by a transition to becoming a paramedical tattoo artist, my back has endured considerable strain and discomfort. It appeared that there was no relief in sight from the daily pain that had become an unwelcome constant in my life.

Before seeking treatment at Florida Spine and Pain Specialists, I diligently explored a multitude of avenues in search of relief. These included physical therapy, massage therapy, topical treatments, and even alternative therapies like cupping, yet the debilitating pain persisted.

From the very outset of my treatment and continuing throughout its course, I have undergone a remarkable transformation. I now find myself capable of maintaining an upright posture with ease, enjoying more restful nights of sleep, and, most significantly, actively participating in the lives of my children.

The profound impact that Florida Spine and Pain Specialists have had on my well-being is beyond measure. Their expertise, compassion, and unwavering dedication have not only alleviated my physical discomfort but have also instilled in me a renewed sense of hope and vitality. I am profoundly grateful for the exceptional service they have provided and the positive influence they have had on my life. From the depths of my heart, I extend my gratitude for affording me the opportunity to regain my health and actively engage in my son's childhood.",2025-02-04|2024-07-25|2025-02-04|2023-10-18|2023-08-16|2023-04-06|2024-03-14|2023-10-10,5|5|5|5|3|1|1|5,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|11 a.m.",47|41.2|34.8,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended, On-site parking",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|rude_staff|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJWzzj_pfRwogRl4j3SLFgyB8,64

No patient should ever have to go through this. My mother-in-law immediately switched doctors, and I highly recommend that others do the same. Stay far away from this place. Let's me explain why:

I'm writing this review based on my mother-in-law's experience, and I am absolutely shocked at the unprofessionalism of this office. What happened to her was highly unusual and completely unacceptable.

Doctor Crane, change her medication and then she called their office to tell them the medication didn't work for her. And that she needed to go back to the pain medication that she was on for 8 years. And they called the police on her and my father-in-law--two elderly individuals. The police got involved, and she was suddenly being accused of being suicidal, which was completely false. She never said anything of the sort, yet she was treated as if she were a danger to herself. This caused her an enormous amount of distress and shock. highly recommend that others do the same. Stay far away from this place!!|If they can't give you injections, they won't do nothing for you!
They will have you spend an hour and a half when they send you their paperwork to fill out and then they will say that you might are a candidate for opioid pain medication!
When you get there, you'll have a person not a nurse or anything take your blood pressure then tell you they won't be able to do that but they would love you injections your neck!
If you've been there, let me know cause have A lawsuit against them!
Wrongful malpractice!
It's on YouTube check it out
I filmed recorded ! the whole event!
If you're in pain, don't go there cause all they wanna do is rip you off and your insurance company for money and not help you!

That's where they messed up!
We're gonna hold them to the line!
Justice!
Not gonna stop  !
Till Out of Business!
Make sure you call the state and the city and the government on their practice until they get investigated properly'
Hope you get out of pain, but these people put you in pain and they put it in their pockets!
They're going to jail!|I had injections for the first time here today.  Very minimal waiting before they called me in. I don't think I've ever been to a medical facility that was as kind and considerate as all the employees were there. They talked me through things and made me feel safe. And believe me, I was a nervous wreck. I have to go back a few more times and I'm okay with that. I would highly recommend this facility for my family and friends. Thank you Florida Pain Institute for making my appointment professional as well as personal. .|Don't go here. I have been going for 10 months and still haven't gotten anything for pain my back due to broken vertebrae. All they want to do is drug screening each time I go and its $85 each time. And I only have seen the doctor once on my first visit. Seeing a PA since then and she hasn't done anything for me.  Such a waste of time and money. I have suffered too  long and going somewhere else that
has much higher reviews.|I have multiple family Members who are Patients at Florida Pain Institute. The scheduling department is horrific. They have three locations but only perform certain procedures at each office. Good Luck at the Palm Bay office. The Doctors
must think the drive is to far as generally you can only see a ARNP. The staff in PB in the past was inept and currently most of them are new. Retention must be a problem. They probably treat staff the same as their patients. Thus far we've had injections and nerve ablations. Neither provided much relief. I ended up resorting to a cervical surgery. The cost of my cervical fusion and disc replacement was similar in cost to the nerve ablations. Hence the reason they push these procedures so hard. $$ I am currently waiting for my Mother who had surgery scheduled at 9 AM. It is 11:20 and she is still sitting in the waiting room. To add to that, she is in pain, hasn't had anything to eat and I took the day off to care for her. I will be seeking different options for Pain Management Doctors and I would suggest you do too!  This is the third procedure with a wait over 2 hours. We received a 10$ Starbucks Gift card for our last experience. Pay attention to the reviews.|This institution is concerned with making money. They push you to having procedures where they charge big bucks. They wouldn't even tell me the cost of the numerous procedures they suggested.  They do not care about what need or want. Do it their way or go somewhere else. That's their motto! Have fibromyalgia and live alone, who is going to take care of me during the five procedures they want to do. They have no concern except making money. They have no respect for your personal needs. It's all about $$$$. He got a medical degree from the college of the Caribbean?|I have been a patient here for over 30 years and highly recommend if you're experiencing chronic pain|Tampa Pain Relief Clinic has many location in Florida. Before I went to have a procedure done, the Merritt Island location called me to let me know how much it was going to be out of pocket. Once the Merritt Island location gave me the price I said that I could not afford it at this time and canceled the procedure. The next day I got a call from the Melbourne location, they said if I had the procedure at their location, I would only need to pay the copay. The reason for the difference in price I was told, is because the Merritt Island location used a third party surgical center and the Melbourne location does the procedure in the office. Before I had the procedure, the Melbourne location called me and said that they called the insurance company and I only would be required to pay the copay. So I did have the procedure at the Melbourne office.

I love him. He takes the time and explains everything which, includes options. I highly recommend him if you are serious looking for a pain management Doctor. Also if he isn't available ask for Gary. They are the only 2 Drs that gave me shots for my back that actually worked.|I was familiar Dr. Lenz from the Lake Worth Surgical Center. After my Doctor of 15 years retired I was referred to Dr. Lenz. My long time Doctor was great, he really took care of me. But in just one appointment with Dr. Lenz I already feel like I'm in the right place. Not only explaining how each issue affects us, but simply by understanding and being compassionate toward someone living with several chronic issues. I would recommend Dr. Lenz to anyone who is serious about their care and who is responsible enough to manage your daily life with the tools and treatments he offers and recommends. I know im in good Hands here. Thank you Dr. Lenz.|Good morning, Dr. Gatz your office staff are very knowledge, professional and respectful. Every time I call due to reschedule my appointment or coming late the staff be very honest with me were can I come or not simple as that. Keep up with the good work Comprehensive Pain Team.|Dr Gatz is my hero! I was suffering from RSD for years before I saw him. He has an awesome bedside manner and came to see me twice in the hospital after my surgery. People complain about waiting too long. So what when you are getting great care. He is busy but has always been there for me. The office girls are great! The only complaint I have is trying to reach the office. I can reach Dr. Gatz, but not the office. Bring a book because you will wait.
I am adding to my review 7 years later as I am still a patient at Comprehensive Pain of the Palm Beaches (which should tell you how incredible the doctors, nurse practitioners, medical assistants, physicians assistants, and the front office and back office staff is). While things have changed with the office and with Dr. Lentz heading the medical staff. It's all been for the best! The longest I have waited is no more than 15 minutes now, and instead of seeing Melissa as my ARNP I now see Gary Edman regularly and not only is he extremely knowledgeable his compassion, care, and concern for his patients is astounding! I have a medical background myself, and I am ALWAYS treated with respect based on my own knowledge. After a recent ACDF surgery, both Gary and Dr. Lentz took the time to fully assist in my recovery. I recently had trigger point injections done by Dr. Lentz relieved the constant pressure left from my new titanium disc in my neck and finally got some relief that my neurosurgeon's office could not provide.
I can't imagine ever leaving a practice where such care and concern for patients has ALWAYS appeared to me to be a number one priority for each and every staff member. Thank you ALL for your kindness, compassion, and support and for never being judgemental when I express my needs as a chronic pain patient. My needs are almost always met each month in a timely and professional manner!
If only other doctors and medical staff had the same amount of care, compassion, and concern for chronic pain patients. For we who suffer 24/7/365 from pain that oftentimes is at the top of the McGill pain index could actually learn how to MANAGE life even though we suffer so much and at times silently out of fear of being judged as ""pill seekers"" or drug addicts which we are NOT! Shame on the medical community for now educating future medical staff that ALL pain medications are bad and shouldn't even be given to ANYONE no matter what their condition is. Most true chronic pain patients are NOT drug addicts. They're unique people with oftentimes unique problems. WE'RE NOT ALL THE SAME!!! By limiting the care for those of us whose chronic pain can more often than not take over our entire lives and leave us wondering if life is even worth living in such agony is only causing many chronic pain sufferers to take their own lives.
If you're like me and relate to what I have gone through, then you need to make an appointment at Comprehensive Pain of the Palm Beaches! I finally have a much fuller, happier life knowing that my severe chronic pain is being controlled and if I ever need to alter or change my treatment plans I know that I am listened to and heard by the ENTIRE staff at Comprehensive Pain of the Palm Beaches. .|I made an appointment with Christian he was wonderful. He called me back to follow up which was great . I told him my insurance kicks in January 1 and I will wait  because I could only pay half. He said no come in you can make a partial payment of 200 and we will bill the rest.  When I get here Marisol would not let me be seen . She said I had to pay the entire 300 .I think that is terrible to do that to a patient . They seem very disorganized . They definitely are not on the same page. I'm in terrible pain . It's horrible to do that to a patient. Someone says come and we can see you, then the Marisol says no we can't. Marisol stated Christian does not have the authority to make appointments that why. Why would he do it if he could not . I guess it is good for some and not others. Marisol is very matter a fact and her body language is all wrong. She should not be dealing with patients. Marisol is the office manager , she definitely has poor customer service skills . She does not need to be the face of the office and the first person you deal with when you walk in .I know everyone has policies , but if you make a mistake you accommodate the patient , not inconvenience the patient. Marisol stated she called me to verify my insurance and I didn't call back . It does not matter if I didnt call back . I was paying cash and was told how much I had to pay.|First time meeting Dr. GATZ   Was January 3,2022.And he took his time explaining me everything.  A full hour. You never get that with a Dr. Didn't make me nervous.  I can tell he does care about his patients.  Plus his staff was all wonderful.  By far most the best Dr I've ever been to with dealing with my back issues.|Dr Bart Gatz has listened to my needs. I am more mobile and motivated. I have lost 5 pounds because I can exercise now.

I recommend the clinic to anybody who lives in pain and needs help.|This drs office has been a great place for people suffering with chronic pain until very recently. There is a new dr and pa specifically one named Gabi you really want to avoid. I don't understand why she has such a problem with people who are suffering with chronic pain but she does.

Because all the way around, the people & the services they provide are, most definitely worth it! I would give them more than 5 stars, if I could!|Today my appointment, was injections into my spine. Do you recommended for me to get nerve blockers done, to help all the pain in my legs and of course my back!! Dr. Gorman, makes the procedure very pleasant by talking to you the whole time! It's a great bedside manner, and answers any and all questions before during and after the procedure! I would highly recommend Dr. Gorman to anyone that has chronic pain! Or even somebody that's looking for answers of why they are in so much pain!! 
C.Roy|It was a refreshing visit . I was brought back pretty quickly and Dr. Gorman came in shortly after. He sat down and patiently listened to me. He then went over his plan to help me. My visit went as I remember visits I've had with excellent Doctors in the past - Good. When your Dr.  Seems to care and listens. When your Dr. doesn't act as if he's being rushed and makes the effort to make sure you understand the plan he's just gone over with you. I happily recommend Dr. Gorman. It really was refreshing, thanks for the reminder Doc.|If you're searching for a pain management physician... then look no further, Dr. Gorman is the one! Dr. Gorman is the Michelin if that was a term for physicians! I brought my mother who was in so much lower back pain here, and he was very professional... but yet very down to earth. He explained things in a manner that we understood, he has excellent bedside manners, a very personable person with a great personality. My mother had a procedure done today, and he asked me if I wanted to be in the room where the procedure was being done... he asked my mother as well. I have never had a physician ask me that, and actually welcome me. My mother had a previous experience with another pain management physician that was very uncomfortable, and unpleasant... so we were very hesitant to try this again. Dr. Gorman made it such a pleasant experience, he made my mother feel so comfortable, and above all my mother felt no pain whatsoever. Observing this on my end made me feel so appreciative, and thankful for Dr. Gorman. His staff is amazing, very professional, and welcomed us to the facility with open arms... they  made us feel comfortable and at ease as well. Thank you so much Dr. Gorman, and his entire staff! You're all greatly appreciated! Merry Christmas to all of you, and your families!|Dr. is excellent. Who controls the admin part? PPOA? They need more doctors, more CSR's and direct contact. Being in cue for 20 patients before me to answer phones is UNACCEPT-ABLE, an hour wait time before being seen. I'm amazed that all the staff stay professional.
And the entry door needs an automatic door opener for all of us disabled adults! It's very heavy, patients often need extra help to enter or leave. Myself included.|Love Dr. Gorman...I have only gone to him since July and he has done more to help ease my pain in such a short time than the previous pain management doctor did in 20 years. All office staff and medical assistants are very friendly and professional...would recommend Dr Gorman to everyone with chronic back pain.|Dr. Gorman is great about making his clients feel welcome and taken care of.
I don't like waiting 40mins to an hour to be seen. The staff is 50/50 in relation to making you feel comfortable & not an inconvenience for them. The building is clean and the doctor is amazing.

I currently am seen at their Hillsborough Ave. location in Tampa.
At my last appointment I was called in my medication as usual.  I verified with nurse that correct dosage would be called in.  She  ( Megan) assured me it would (it was called in incorrectly in April, but corrected). When I went to pick up meds I discovered wrong dosage had been called in again. I Immediately called office for them to correct. I was told an urgent  message would be sent to doctor.  No response, nothing happened.  No phone call, no corrected script.  This was on a Friday.  I heard nothing throughout the day so left messages on portal and with answering service.  I made sure the answering service knew i was out of medication.  Again, no replies.  This left me with no medication over the weekend.  On Monday am. again I phoned the offices and again they said they would leave urgent msg.  My phone rang shortly after.  I could hear papers shuffling but no one was responding to my hello.  I went back to portal, I couldnt get through on phone. I left a message that I couldnt hear whoever called, please call again as I can't get through.  Again no response.  I then called Walgreens who still had no corrected prescription.  However the female who answered the phone said doctors are doing this everywhere.  They are calling in lower dose scripts. My doctor had no discussion with me about a taper. EVER
So, now here I sit extremely uncomfortable, nothing to help with my pain.  Do i pick up this lower dose script?  Do i believe this is just another error (this happened in April as well but got corrected).  No idea.  I have no idea what to do.
Physicians should return phone calls.  Physicians or their staff should communicate with patients.  If you're looking for that kind of doctor, look elsewhere.
I'm a 64 year old woman with a bladder disease.  I've seen 7 urologists over 20 years and tried all procedures, surgeries, etc. before being referred to this pain specialist for severe pain. The pain of this disease is equal to cancer pain.  That is why I'm on disability.  And my doctor  ( Dr.Grana) or his staff can't return a phone call and advise me if this is a forced taper or another error.
Well you have one less patient to worry about.
And what's even more concerning, I just reviewed my patient portal (and made some copies of what is there).  They don't even have my correct diagnosis/disease listed.  They have back pain/knee pain as chief complaints. I fill out a form to check in every month, and it clearly says Interstitial cystitis is my chief complaint yet I don't see this in my records.  I talk often with Meghan ( Dr. Grana's nurse) as well as Dr. Grana about my bladder pain.  Where is it in my records?   I'll be following up on this.
Please check your portals and make sure that it is accurate and up to date.  Mine is neither.  This is unacceptable.|Aghhh after wondering why they canceled my appointment I come to leave a review and I see everyone saying there purging pain meds.  I take Lyrica.  And they cancel a appointment for a new resident who's recently disabled with back surgery . Awesome job Karen of the Dr world .|They are currently purging all patients on pain meds.  They said that they are switching to interventional procedures only.  Such as injections and surgery for electrostimulation devices.  I was told if I didn't want a procedure they would no longer see me.  This is straight-up extortion.  I don't need injections right now and I don't appreciate being bullied into an unnecessary procedure so they can look good to the FDA & CDC on paper.  So if your pain is well controlled by pain medication do not go here as they won't help you.  They are a pain management clinic that has stopped managing pain and instead ignores it unless it can be cured by a procedure.  Honestly, I don't know how they can legally call themselves a pain management office since they only perform surgery.  Their sign needs to be changed from Tampa Pain Relief Centers to Tampa Surgery Centers since this is all they do now.|Had a very frustrating second visit. I've been suffering from neck pain since august and was finally referred to this place. It was only my second visit and it was exhausting.

First off, I'm a full time college student and a worker. Today was my only day off, so I scheduled my appointment at 12:45 so that i could have the remaining day to catch up on school work. I even got there 15 mins early just in case. I kid you not, I sat in the patient room until 2! And I still wasn't seen. I had ONE lady come and take my blood pressure and that was it. The remaining time I was waiting and waiting and waiting. I understand that doctors have other patients, but don't schedule me at a time where you won't even be able to see me until hours after. Seems like they clearly over-scheduled because there were also other people in there who haven't been seen. Just seems ridiculous to be waiting in a doctors office for over an hour and still haven't been seen. I'm sorry its just I've got things in my day to do, I don't have all day to be waiting. Seems like they have no sense of urgency. And then the lady I spoke to first to express my frustration(calmly) was rude. She gave an attitude saying well he's got other patients. Like yeah I get that, but if he can't see a patient every hour, then don't schedule one every hour.

Bummed because I'm just trying to find treatments for my neck and it seemed like they just didn't care.|Who is the Owner, I was impressed with Dr Rivera with doing my procedure but now he will NOT fill out my SHORT TERM DISABILITY PAPERWORK. I had Surgery I had stitches and was told that it could take up to 3 months to heal. Last week Denise the office manager said that Dr Rivera told her to tell me that he will not fill out my paperwork. His NP Stacy told me the same thing at my visit this week, but when Dr Rivera walked in the room, he said no? Just print the Dr's notes and send them to the insurance company.
After the surgery Denise said that Dr Rivera said that I should heal in 2 to 3 days and then go back to work.
Well I did that. I was sent home I couldn't function at work..

leaving the office after my follow up Tuesday ,Stacy said that she and Denise would sit down the next day and come up with a plan. I waited to hear back from them until later in the day, finally I called I was told that Stacy left in the afternoon.

I was told today by Stacy again today that Dr Rivera spoke to one of the other drs and that Dr said that it should take up to 10 days to heal. Which is it ?
Then Stacy said that Dr Rivera said that he will not fill out my short term Disability paperwork. When I saw Dr Rivera
On Tuesday, he told me that I was a category 2 and that means that It could take up to 3-6 months to heal.
He said that with this procedure some patients heal quicker than others but not in my case.
In my presence on Tuesday,Dr Rivera told Stacy to get his visit notes and send them to the my insurance company.

Now everything has changed AGAIN.
I'm fed up and I have been told to take it to another level,
I am very very sore still and can hardly walk. I was told by Stacy  a few weeks ago that Dr Rivera's said do not do anything until I see him during my follow up 1 month after the procedure
None of this back and forth makes sense. I'm a worker and not a couch potato. I just got the word on TUESDAY, that NOW I can start slowly and go swimming,
Im so confused right now with this back and forth, he said and I said which has been going on for ALMOST 1 month.|Hello, this place needs someone at the reception who speaks Spanish, because many people come here who do not speak English and need to be attended to correctly and the people at the reception who are currently working do not want to help with that, thank you and I hope you solve this problem.|I was very happy with the staff and the wonderful doctor Lubin.|I have been going to Tampa Relief Pain Center for years. I never had any problems. Well that has certainly changed. I have been going to Dr Rivera. I am coming back for another procedure because I am in severe pain. He said that he had sent the medication to my pharmacy to reduce my pain. So, of course, I called my pharmacy to see if anything was called in. They said no. Then I tried to call the office. So frustrating, they never answered the phone. An answering service answered in the middle of the day. The service said all that she could do is FAX a message to the office. Crickets. I heard nothing. No phone calls, texts nothing. So the next day I called the pharmacy.....nothing. Then at 11:00am during regular business hours I called back. Answering service eventually picked up. Again, said all she could do is send a FAX. So what's the problem? I believe they care nothing for their patients. They care so little they don't even want to talk to you. My primary  told me to go to a pain doctor for my severe pain. I only have hope and pray that I can get some relief soon. This severe pain has been going on since against.

She listens, makes recommendations, provides counseling and always have been there when I need a helping hand.  Thank you all you kindness.

I love the doctor's and the staff keep up the good work.|I really don't want to give this place even one star as long as Pearl Fox remains an employee! I've only been to this place 3 times for the last 3 months and each and every single time it was nothing but incompetence. How difficult can it be to make a phone call about a referral or to obtain authorization from an insurance company before sending in the prescription?? Unfortunately my doctor was out of the office this last visit I had so one of the regular workers by the name of Pearl is the nurse that saw me that day.  Right away she started taking over me and was very pushy and bothering ssy. She told me that she had been trying to get a urine sample from me for months which was a complete lie. So now we have incompetent liars working here. I had never met the woman.  Nor
was I ever asked for a urine test except for my very 1st visit which I gladly gave them one.  The question is, why lie? What are you trying to cover up? The whole time I was there she clearly was more interested in wrongly accusing me rather than fixing her mistakes and moving forward. I have every intention of turning this company in just as soon as I'm done with this review.   Clearly she is a followers rather than a leader. Her husband really needs a new partner. It's time for her to go!

They have to be the nicest group of people. I always feel heard and any issues are always addressed immediately. Things have been pretty bad trying to get medication lately but they go above and beyond to help you get what is needed.
I can't say enough about what a great place to be able to go for my medical care. Thanks a million to Tina for helping me get through the difficult times. You are definitely an asset to CPMC. She's so compassionate and understanding and knows always exactly the best way to help. Thanks Tina...
Thanks to all of you at CPMC.

I no longer go to Charlotte pain management after 13+ years. There's a new doctor that took over July of 2024. He doesn't believe in pain medicine. He thinks pretty much it's all in our minds. He wants all patients of any type of pain medication and to start doing injections for pain management instead. I've done them in the past and was almost paralyzed during a X-ray guided injection at a surgery center. Tried again in the office and had no relief. Most people I talk to say they don't help or maybe just for a week of slight relief.
I would not go back if the same doctor is still there or until they change their ways.

Dr Torres did my SI injection. I've had so many procedures done at the place I used to go to and I felt like I was on an assembly line. It was a kind of ""next....next... situation. It was all about how many appointments they could jam in a day . Outrageously long waiting times.
And their office staff was below sub par.

Dr. Torres has without a doubt changed my life for the better. I still do have pain of course and with my condition I always will but with the treatment I receive from Dr. Torres I can enjoy my life and have the ability to enjoy time with my granddaughter.

And break down, totally uncalled for. she knows this about me but still gives me a hard way to go . This I know from the first encounter with her. I have an extremely important  and time sensitive (urgent). Medical records forwarded to the VA administration. I already knew I would have problems with Maggie. I ask my wife to contact her, and explain what I was dealing , my medical records to the VA administrations. Simply about 10-15 minuet procedures.  With her meanness, hatefulness and difficulty in perform the simplest task caused me to speak over her I have  mental health issues. And she knows what buttons to push. As if she enjoys being extremely difficult. I think she has been there so long she has some kind of power trip because when I asked to speak with Dr.Cadelle or Jannie sapp, her response was that's not going to happen. I guess she owns this business if the buck stops with her. Furthermore I refuse to be disrespected and abused by your staff. I'm a veteran with allot of medical issues that should be taken into consideration. If that kindness and curtesy can not be extended I think there is a sever internal problem. I am now still very upset and this should never happen anywhere. My issue ( I think) has resolved, but it came at an extremely severe cost to my mental health and overall well being. Beware... additionally she said to me that I was always a problem with her lies. I had one negative encounter and realized what kind of person she is so I was always kind, courteous trying not to engage if i didn't   have to. For this particular issue I had to get my crippled disabled wife out of the house (extremly difficult). To run interference. Sad!!! Do your job, be kind, and quit abusing people. V/R Randal Pilgram.|Staff very friendly, actually want to be in their jobs. Maggie is super nice, and Kim too. They processed me in very fast,  and answered my questions in a professional manner. Medical assistant very nice, friendly, actually listened too!!  Mr. Dr. Caudill is extremely smart, very hard worker, he listened attentively to me. He showed great caring and concern for my pain and joints. He was funny, yet 98 percent business. No BS doctor, gets right to the point. Honest and upfront. I look forward to my next appointment.  He takes great care of hos veterans too!!|I am pretty angry, I called to schedule an appointment and as soon as they heard my BCBS was through market place they wouldn't accept me.

Very sad.|I have many Drs which I'm not happy to say but Dr Caudill, TC, Maggie & Shelly (all of the staff) put a smile on my face every time I go no matter how much pain I'm in that day. They treat you like a human & thats hard to find anymore. Dr Caudill & TC (the only ones I see but all of the Drs there are amazing) listen & I can talk all day long. They always shows true concern & you don't find that often. My only issue is I wish I found them sooner.

Dr. Hebert is great!
However, I did reach out through the patient portal to change an appointment and to get a correction made to my file and never received a reply.
That is the only reason for 3 stars|I was a prior patient with DR Concepcion for several years and was very satisfied but relocated away from the area. While gone I was in a near fatal motorcycle accident requiring several reconstructive surgeries and much more discomfort. When I returned I was required to come in as a new patient and was told by Doctor C that he was unable to treat me.|Dr Justin Hebert is excellent in treating all my bone pains. I a m a very complicated patient but first time I came to him, he listens to all my complaints and amazingly he is very empathetic and understands all my pains . He has a solution for each complaint of pains in my lower back with spinal stenosis, my right shoulder which is bone n bone, right side of my neck and my left hip which is probably related to sciatica. I am so miserable with pain but Dr. Hebert slowly one by one relieved my pains to a point that I was able to travel for the holidays to my daughters in New Jersey. Prior to coming to Dr Hebert, I can't hardly move nor walk due to all my pains. Besides trigger points, he also injected my shoulder joint & AC joint. Although he has not completed his plan of pain management, at least I was able to travel.i was almost bedridden due to pain but he was able to resolve most of my pain without narcotics . Thank you Dr Hebert for being an excellent physician and expert Pain Management.
Lelia Montes|What a disappointment,,,
Spent $200 as a new patient,waited over an hour n a half to b seen,,,this young man came in,never examined me,had to ask him what's going on with my back(2 previous back surgeries)i can hardly stand,tie my shoes,etc,,,he says oh,u have bersidas,,,have an x- ray saying nothing about bersidas,,,long story short,nurse gave me a shot in the butt n sent me on my way,,,said come back tomorrow for t.p.injections,another $180,,,3 hours after I left i was in so much pain,wasn't going back,,,,
A REAL EXPERIENCE,THATS Y THEY SAY TO STAY AWAY FROM PAIN MGMT,A WASTE OF MONEY,,,I AGREE|Great people, they are all very nice. Dr. Herbert is very kind and honest, he made sure to answer all of my questions thoroughly. He has made my treatment simple and easy. Thank you for all of your help during this painful time in my life.|I have been incorrectly charged for late payment. The original bill was paid but the office manager hides behind her desk and will not even discuss the issue with me.  I am so disappointed in her refusal to resolve the uncalled for charge. The response seems to be a computer generated response. The person who can correct the situation refused to discuss with me.|I have had an ongoing problem with some discs in my lower back for the last 20 plus years. I have had three episodes where I have had needed neurologists and an anesthesiologist  to address my spinal column issues. I've had a few bumps and bruises along the way, but nothing compares to bulging, mushrooming discs, and sciatic pain, nothing.
My neurologist scheduled me to see Dr. Herbert, an Anesthesiologist at the Pain Consultants of West Florida. On my first visit I met with Dr. Herbert and we discussed my back history and the issues I've had in the past and the treatment plan(s) that were used. I wanted to try the epidurals; they had worked in the past and we've had great success with them. I had been as good as new since 2018 which was when the latest episode occurred.  I was very impressed with the administrative staff when I checked in, very efficient, personable, and nice. Dr. Herbert's nursing support staff was also on their 'A game.' I found them all to be very professional and very patient with us ol Geezers taking forever to get out the chairs, etc. to show them some documentation.
But all of that would have been for naught if Dr. Justin Herbert wasn't on top of his game. Dr. Herbert gave me two epidurals  (the previous two times in 2002 and 2018 I had 3 epidural procedures.) We met for a consultation about undergoing a third epidural procedure, I had been thinking about it for several days, and I couldn't think of reason for it. My back was as good as new, or as good as it will get when you're my age. Dr Herbert and I decided it would be pointless to go ahead with the third epidural, but I could if I wanted to. It all depended on me, how my back felt. When I would talk with my friends after the procedure and they'd ask, ""How'd it go?"" I'd tell them, ""It went well, didn't hurt and this doc is able to get right down in there, same exact spot where I would feel the sciatic nerve pain start when this injury happened. Dr Herbert's procedures seem more exact, more precise. I guess this doc's got more on his fastball than those in the past."" Or maybe medicine has advanced in the last 22 years, but this was a noticeable improvement from the previous two, and those were not bad, they certainly did the trick.  I have been extremely blessed with my results from the epidural procedures I've had on my lower back.
In 22 years when I am in my mid 80s and this happens again, I am going to the Pain Consultants of West Florida and will be requesting to see Dr. Herbert. In the meantime, I will be telling all my family and friends if they need this kind of medical treatment, go see Dr. Herbert. You can't do any better. (I apologize for being a little 'long winded' but I felt I should detail the great work that is being done at the PCWF.)|Dr Conception and staff are exceptional in care.

Although I drive from Mt Dora to Winter Park each month the staff makes it an enjoyable visit.|I just called the on call doctor and her name was Ilene the first thing she said the was did you wake me up because you are in pain. I said excuse me and she repeated  her self. I had to asked her three times who was it I speaking to before she would give me her name. She said if I am in that much pain that I should go into the ER because there was no place to call a prescription into at 1 o'clock in the morning. When I mentioned the 24hr CVS she said she don't think I should take the oral version of the medication that helps and that she could send something in the morning. If she doesn't want anyone waking her up she should not be an on call doctor.  I have never had a doctor be so rude. I will be putting in a formal complaint first thing Monday morning.

Update: The staff at the actual office have reached out to me multiple times to check on me and I am very grateful that they have been working with me to get me better.|Front staff are friendly. Waiting room is clean. Dr Salina's is a joy to work with. He doesn't talk down. He listens. He knows every persons pain is different. He knows every persons path to living,  not just surviving is unique. He will work with you. He is worth driving the distance to see.|I went to my appointment thinking I was seeing my Doctor to set up a spinal epidural procedure and all I ever see is a physician assistant.  I feel like they don't even know my diagnosis. I would go someplace else if there was another place to go !|Worst, most medically irresponsible medical care I have ever received. I have called the office manager multiple times to discuss this but they are always ""busy"", and never call back. One of their providers failed to share details of a prescribed medication with me which is equal to suboxone. Immediately I was red flagged in every system. No pharmacy would fill any more of any of my meds because of this provider. I had providers discharge me because he wrote this prescription, so now on paper i look like a drug addict. Funny thing is, I have no addiction whatsoever,  so I cannot even imagine why he would have prescribed this. I would recommend staying far away from this practice unless you like your entire life being turned upside down by irresponsible medical providers.

They discharged me when they found out I had been in a car accident (after writing this very dangerous prescription) stating that they don't want to have the chance of being called to testify in court because they helped relieve my pain related to it.

These practitioners should have their licenses suspended or revoked for failure to maintain their ethos. Shame on you. Shame on you.

**UPDATE**

Catherine the office manager reached out, and we discussed the situation. She has said that her and the Dr. will speak with any providers who are refusing me service based on the prescription of this medication as this was NOT prescribed for drug addiction. I am looking forward to seeing how this resolves, as my entire life has been impacted by this. Will update again as resolution happens.|Had an appointment for 9:30. After waiting until 10:00, I inquired about the delay and was told they're running about 15 minutes behind. Nope, it's an hour +.
This is a normal recurring event at this mis managed practice. There are 21 people in here in waiting room for only 3 surgery beds. This is normal here, not occasionally, but each and every appointment.

I just love everything about his office.  I highly recommend his practice to anyone who needs a solution for their pain management treatments.|Today was especially great because it was a telehealth appointment because of hurricane Milton, which I really appreciated so I didn't have to use gas to come into the office. Highly recommend this practice doctors and nurses practitioners and staff are great but their only issue is they never return a phone call on any of their answering lines and I mean never. Nothing is even noted in the chart that the  patient has called multiple times a day and for many days in a row even asking for an urgent message to be sent to the doctor when I had a family emergency and had to leave the state. They say they check their messages multiple times a day and will call you back, but they never do and this has happened numerous times and the next time I went in I asked the nurse practitioner if there was any notes in my chart and she said there was no record of me calling there so I showed her on my phone in my recent phone calls the  many many times that I had called the office and no one ever returned my phone call from any line or from the front desk after leaving multiple urgent messages. The front desk never answered their phone, even when I spoke to someone on the answering service who tried multiple times each day.

Throughout my time as a patient I've seen numerous providers at one point or another and they all have been wonderful. Miss Sadi always takes the time to listen to any issues that you maybe experiencing as well as making sure you understand all your options. She always has that warm welcoming smile and great bedside manner that helps ease the anxiety you maybe experiencing when you're trying to figure out what's wrong and what course of action is the best for your situation. I would ten out of 10 recommend her to my own family as well as anyone that suffers chronic pain.

Thanks to Maggie, she took me to the back as quickly as possible and apologized for the error more than once. This is beginning to be a pattern with this front office staff, who have been less than professional previously.

I was very nervous, but his calming voice talked me through the entire procedure. Today, 4 days later, I am once again on the mend. I would highly recommend Dr Giordano and his team. Thank you all!!|This morning I went on a half hour walk along the beach thanks to Dr. G. at Florida Spine and Pain.
This is really amazing since I've had constant pain in my back, left hip and leg ever since my hip surgery over 2 years ago.
I'm waking up and able to walk without support through my home and join in family activities which have always been so important to me.
Thank you DR. G. for understanding and making my life so much brighter.|Dr G n Dr Janice are the best.  They have compassion n empathy something that lacks in today's world. The staff are all worthy of enhancing the work these 2 doctors provide.  I am so glad they were referred to me. Keep up the awesome job you all are doing.  We need people like you.  Pain is difficult enough to deal with.|After decades of seeing doctors for neck and back pain from many accidents (caused by other people,) and accomplishing nothing at all to improve my daily life, I happened to meet Dr Giordano in New Smyrna Beach florida at an office he was at. He was absolutely amazing, and when he left the practice he was at in NSB and opened his own practice in Melbourne, I drove from Ormond Beach to Melbourne to reestablish with him Doctor G. & I had been speaking. About a spinal stimulator I agreed to it. At this point in time the stimulator in my back has been installed for 2 years & 135 days and I am very pleased with the results. Doctor Giordano is very knowledgeable, takes his time to it explain. The procedures he is performing, walks you through every step. I am also getting injections from Doctor G. I highly. Recommend this amazing physician, his staff is very pleasant and accommodating. For anybody experiencing pain that no one else could deal with please help yourself and call the office. You won't regret it. Going to a doctors office and feeling at ease is worth me driving 2 hours to see him. Whether I go to his main office in Melbourne or his satellite office in Titusville. I am always made to feel comfortable and relaxed and thank you for all you've done Dr. Giordano and staff.

I went to Dr. G because of these reviews so I want to take a minute to thank him and his staff. Dr. G talks to you like a friend not only a patient.

Thanks again Dr. G!|Well, where do I start!!! I had a referral from my primary doctor to come to the Central Florida Spine n Pain Center. My doctor Dr. Ashta referred that I see Dr. Giordano about my situation. Upon arriving to his establishment I notice how friendly the staff were. How clean n amazing the lobby area was.
I call this awesome doctor Dr. G cause I can't pronounce his name.  But, he's good with Dr. G! This amazing doctor worked on me for months but unfortunately the shots were not effective. I had severe pain n Dr. G said I would have to have back surgery. On, April 24, 2024 I had the surgery n when I tell you I thank God for this doctor. Awesome work n a great great doctor. I'm healing n feeling fantastic. I recommend Dr. Nicholas Giordana to everyone that needs his professional skills. Thank you n God Bless!|I have Si joint pain from a car accident. I have had a hard time sleeping. Dr. Giordano gave me a pain injection in exactly the right spot! I feel amazing. I will be sleeping like a baby tonight. Thank you so much, Doc!!!|Over a year ago I started this journey.  I woke up one morning with a sharp pain going down my right leg.  Walking a little helped the pain go away for a while, but each day the pain got worse and would last longer. During my yearly doctor's checkup, he recommended that I see Dr. Nicholas Giordano, MD. at the Spine & Pain of Central Florida. After getting an MRI, I was informed that I had 5 bulging disks. I started using a walker and ended up in a wheelchair.
For treatment Dr. Giordano recommended some shots and then, when those did not work, he recommended the MILD procedure.  This procedure took away all the sharp pain down my leg which was about 90% of the issue but I still had an ache in my right leg that would not allow me to sleep in a bed, I slept in a recliner. Dr. Giordano next recommended getting the electronic stimulation procedure. The procedure allowed me to do a 5-day trial to make sure I would be a good candidate.  When the trial period was up and it worked for me, Dr. Giordano recommended that I do the permanent procedure.   Dr. Giordano performed this procedure, did a great job, and now I am totally pain free.  I can now stand, walk, and get on with my life.  If anyone is thinking about getting any of these procedures, I recommend contacting Dr. Giordan's office, there is nothing to lose except the pain you are experiencing, I am one of the success stories.",2025-01-20|2024-10-15|2024-06-11|2023-11-14|2024-04-23|2024-05-02|2024-05-21|2024-01-12,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","do you take CARE PLUS HMO

Almost pain free and free from pain meds.|The doctor and there is very nice very considerate and understanding maybe try to help you but they have to wait for Medina's authorize everything but they're very helpful up front in the back and is very quick she never makes you wait too long|I have been going to Florida Pain Relief Group for several years now after having a couple different pain doctors before.  I can say without a doubt that they definitely care about their patients and respect their patient decisions.  They've offered a few different treatment plans and I've tried a few and refused to do the others and they completely understand.  Also, I've seen a few different doctors from Alexis to Kristopher to Dr Medina and they all have made me feel welcome and comfortable going to them monthly for my appointments whereas before my monthly appointments were the most stressful events ever.  Additionally, the office staff are all very warm, welcoming and responsive.  Trish is by far the best though, she remembers the patients and random things that I don't expect them to ever recall which makes it feel even more like they care.

Thanks guys for finally making me comfortable with having to see a doctor.

Update:  this practice is great, Jensen and Ann are amazing!!!|Everyone at this office is fantastic. Dealing with Anne is always a pleasure. Thank you so much to the entire crew for the excellent service|BRANDON location. Thief's! Make sure you check your explanation of benefits (EOB) because they WILL overcharge you if you don't say anything. I fought to get back to this doctor, and all he did was rip me off left and right. He charged me an unnecessary $4,500 for a surgery that my insurance covered, and on top of that, I realized that they were charging me $10 more per visit. This doctor is so not worth it on so many levels.|I've now been going here a year and a half. I see Jennifer and I absolutely adore her! I am just praying that I can remain a patient. I'm at an age now and have been through so much medically that it's very important to me to be seen at a place by someone I'm comfortable with. My last pain Dr I stayed with for 10 years because he was so good to me and definitely went above and beyond, even seeing me free and then half price because I couldn't afford the full price and now my insurance company says that if Dr. Mendia will work with them,they will do some kind of override? But they need to answer the phone. They used too...
That's the only issue I have is the staff puts the phone on voicemail and never returns the I've never had 1 call returned, not one!
Not even to a nurs They're not always kind and kindness goes a long way!
I don't want to switch Drs, I'm too ill to go far and this place is right by the hospital just a little bit over 1.5 miles from my house and so is my primary care Dr now.
I'm praying for something to work out for my well being. It took months and a change in my meds to finally after years I have been able to do yard work again.
This place is a blessing to me , I don't want to leave.
I haven't felt like anyone cares about me since my mom passed in 2018, and I feel compassionate from Jennifer and that's sooooo important to me at this point in my life! I get to stay.
I love this place and they truly treat you asn individual. Not like cattle waiting for hours for an appointment

You will NEVER get an appt.  And if you do manage to get an appt and get your block and need a second one, you wont get it scheduled close enough to the first one to make any difference.  I liked Dr. Huq and his PA.  He did a Ganglion block in my lower back.  While I got slight relief, I was told at the recheck appt that I needed a second block.  I was IN THE OFFICE, and still the 'scheduler' wouldnt give me an appt.  I had to wait to be called.
Its been 2 weeks, no call.  So I called only to get disconnected, then they wont answer my call back.
I am beyond disappointed and now have to start all over with a new doctor.  They should be closed down if they cant take care of the patients they accept.  Either hire more people or stop taking patients.  You have an obligation to give good care.  This doesnt even come close.|Florine ARNP is great.  Front staff is not. Been waiting on Stephanie to call me back to schedule procedure.  Allison staff very rude when I called to speak with Stephanie.  I have a lot of pain and would like to be schedule ASAP.

They made an appointment in one month for nothing other than to charge the insurance and I disputed my co-pay. The new PA wasn't even qualified to help me with long acting medication. She was clueless and very unsympathetic. I will not be going back and will dispute anything that they attempt to bill my insurance.|I have been a patient here for several years, and the response of both the office staff, and the medical providers have always been amazing.

Outstanding Doctors, Nurses and Front office Staff that truly care about their patients!|I drive over 30 miles each way to Jupiter pain management for the excellent service from the doctor and staff.  He was highly recommended from several people and I am so pleased I found him. I had two very good experiences with spinal injections there. I was extremely nervous about having them being terrified of needles, but the friendly nurses there went out of their way to assure me that everything was going to be fine and it was. I found that the staff was more than careing and courteous but concerned and helpful. They stayed with me the hole time. Dr. Drour did an excellent job with helping relieve  my excruciating pain. His bedside manner was wonderful. He was done before I knew it. I would highly recommend him and his staff to anyone in chronic pain before they rush into surgery.|Called for appointment, got sent to voicemail. Left a message with David. No return call.

Dr. Alvarez explained everything in detail on what he was going to do and what I was going to expect very impressed with this operation.|I saw Dr. Loel Warsch today for a follow-up trial Nevro that was done on 8/19. As always he is extremely courteous, prompt and took the time to explain everything. I feel very confident with him giving me spinal  injections too.
And now I am happy to say the trial Nevro implant was a complete success! I can't thank him enough for suggesting this option to me. The last 3 days have been almost 90% pain free. I can't tell you how wonderful this feels as I have been suffering with pain in my spine since 2014! Living with pain is hell! So I would definitely recommend Dr. Warsch to anyone who is living with pain to make an appointment with him for an evaluation today! You won't be sorry you did!

He doesn't listen to your concerns and health needs. His goal is to take control, and make decisions without working with his patients. As of 2/18/21,  I was retaliated on due to this post. I received a certified letter from dr.foltz to reinterrate me being discharged.  He also kindly stated that he will offer me a 30 day refill of my meds while exploring another doctor.  Well, he lied about the 30 day supply of meds. I followed up with him today regarding my refill at his office. He made me sit in the lobby waiting for over 2 hours, and he had only a few patients if they were all there to see him. His nurse finally came out to tell me that my last month supply of meds was the 30 day supply, and she made a courtesy call to my PCP  to give me a 30 day supply.  I spoke with my PCP, and she informed me that no one contacted her or left a message.

Dr. Russell listens to your problems and helps his patients by going above and beyond; not only for pain management problems, but also other medical issues the patient is experiencing.

The office is very clean, and I actually enjoy going to see this doctor, as I know he truly cares about the health and well being of his patients.

We need more doctors like Dr. Russell as our heath care system has been falling short as far as the treatment and care of their patients.

So thankful Dr. Russell is my doctor.|I've been seeing Dr. Russell for about five or six years. During all this time Dr. Russell has taken good care of me making sure I have the medications that I need on a daily basis to get me through. With every appointment I have with him. He always makes sure to go over everything that is going on with me including any new changes in health. Dr. Russell is very good at his job and at staying on top of what is going on with me. Good doctor's area hard to come by. So I'm very glad to have Dr. Russell as my Pain Management Physician. Doctor Russell and the rest of his team there who work with him are some of the best people in their field of work. So if anyone reading this needs a good Pain Management Physician. I highly recommend Dr. Russell and his team or any of the other doctors there.|Dr. Russell is genuine and caring about his patients. He works with you to find the best way to treat your individual needs. It difficult to find a good doctor in his area of expertise in the Tallahassee area. I feel very fortunate to be one of Dr. Russell's patients.|Dr. Russell really cares about your long term capabilities of each patient. He makes sure that he addresses your issues with a great pain management plan. And not to mention the office is very welcoming with exceptional customer service.|Dr Russell is a great Dr . He spends the time needed to address all your. Concerns. The nurses and staff are nice happy bunch of people ..  makes you feel like they care .. They go beyond expectation.|I have always had great care here. I Love Dr. Russell, he has always given 100%. He goes over all of my issues and concerns at every visit, not just the first appt. like a lot of the doctors in his same profession. He does'nt judge you just because you need help. I would recommend him over any of the doctors that I have had in the past. The nurses and office personal are the best. Thank you for your care.
Laura|Always a pleasant experience when visiting Dr. Russell. He listens and responds to problems in appropriate manners. Makes you feel very happy when leaving his practice.|Dr. Russell's management of my pain has dramatically increased the quality of my life. Unlike many medical doctors in the Big Bend, Dr. Russell treats the patient, in addition to the disease. We work together on developing my individualized plan of care using evidence based research to support my treatment. He is remarkably intelligent and can explain complex issues in a non condescending manner. He will not treat you like the other Pain Mgmt physicians. I've had the displeasure of encountering a few through the 19 surgeries I've endured over the years. I can attest that most of them are pompous, arrogant, and have the bedside manners of a rock wearing a white coat. I am able to work and perform my ADLs because I am treated adequately and appropriately by Dr. Russell. He is a phenomenal doctor and a good human. I highly recommend him because he continues to carry on Dr. Pagano's legacy of treating patients with complex pain like human beings and not criminalizing or dismissing them.",2025-02-15|2024-12-17|2024-11-20|2025-01-01|2024-10-31|2024-09-25|2025-01-31|2025-01-22,5|5|5|5|5|5|5|5,,,"10 a.m.|9 a.m.|1 p.m.",56.8|56|54.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|thorough_care|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|convenient_clinic_location|medication_management|injection_treatments|advanced_treatment_options|multilingual_staff_available|experienced_doctors|good_doctors|comfortable_waiting_area|short_wait_times,,,,,,,,,,ChIJwaOwMSFf7IgRxXlhqR55rpI,114

He is incredibly analytical, insightful, compassionate, understanding and above all gifted with the ability to diagnose pretty much ""spot on"" ...he has assisted me 3times with HUGE suggested diagnosis that other specialists missed!

Thank you AffordaHealth|I recently started at a new pain clinic in Davie Florida called Affordable Health. I very rarely leave reviews, but I just wanted to say that the kindness and customer service that is currently being provided by Affordable Pain is above and beyond.  Being a pain patient can sometimes mean getting harshly judged by doctors, pharmacists and insurance companies and quite frankly the stress of that can be significant, so the team over at Affordable Health has really stood out in contrast with so many other places.  They also provide extensive counseling about pain treatments as well as hot packs, tens units, traction and all the other ancillary pain treatment options that you're probably aware (and need) of if you also suffer from pain.  It's just nice to know there's one place you can go and get genuine care and attention and help.

And i was accused of disrespecting the doctor. I was asked to take a swab and pay an additional 60 dollars and recieved a 560 bill for the test. I called and was hung up on. Not to mention I was so sick for having my medication just taken away  i ended up in the hospital. You would think that as women the ladies in the front desk would have understood how uncomfortable the doctor made me but no that's not the result that I received I was treated like a complete animal.|This is the most amazing place in the staff and doctors are compassionate|This is an amazing facility that is very clean and sanitary.

Very aggressive & unprofessional; when I said I am on a fixed income; she said she was a single parent & loudly banged something where she was sitting.
Beware its all about $.
I am a long time patient, time to find pain management that treats you w respect.|I was a patient of Dr. VALENTE for over 15 yrs..  He took over my care from a VERY bad pain doc in Sarasota w/c had sent me to who made my pain much worse.

Dr. VALENTE was willing to take over in the middle of another doctors huge mess and for this I am ever grateful to him.

As time went on I eventually got worse developing O.A, Psoriatic arthritis, had multiple orthopedic surgeries, CRPS that had spread from R leg to entire body, & other conditions.  He put me on a number of meds and I NEVER abused them.  I underwent many diff. types of nerve blocks.  All gave me relief but often short lived.

Then Dr. Ball took over the practice.  He fired EVERY employee but Dr. VALENTE.  Suddenly after more than 15 yrs Dr. VALENTE told me he was retiring soon.  THIS WAS 8 YRS ago now ( to the present 2023).  So, I was lied to as was my w/c attorney as to why he could no longer treat me.

I found a new pain doc who is awesome and listens to my issues.  I only take meds.IF ABSOLUTELY NEEDED !  But Dr. VALENTE started me on the majority.

I needed a pain Mgt doc to conduct period nerve blocks, epidurals etc..  No longer w/c..  I was scheduled to see a doc once again with SWFL PAIN MGT. ( Strictly for nerve blocks, epidurals etc. and received call days later to cancel my appt.  NO excuse other than they don't wish to see me as a patient.  I tried a few times with different docs in the group with NO success !  At the time they were closest to my home & only avail. that I trusted to place a needle in my spine.

I found a new alternative Pain Mgt doc that seems to actually care.  He has never attempted to force me to have a Spinal cord stimulator implant which is y I ended up at SWFL Pain Mgt.  The device was implanted by Sarasota doc and NEVER functioned properly.  My body rejected it !  Dr. VALENTE at the time said some people are NOT mean't to have them.  But Dr. Ball took over & that was his big push.  NO way was I going thru that Hell again.

There are many pain Mgt docs available ( if you truly have severe pain issues).  Don't get fired by a doctor for abuse of pain meds.  U will NEVER find another doctor to take over your care.  There are also MANY highly rated alternative Pain Mgt docs available in Charlotte Co, Lee Co. & Sarasota Co. With far better patient reviews.

I have NO respect for a doctor who lies to me when I've done nothing wrong.  The truth would have been better.

While at SWFL PAIN MGT the wait took forever !  When Dr. Ball took over the practice I ,& the person taking me to a room were forced to stop walking while he in public told one of his employees off.  Neither the place nor the time !

Lack of Professionalism at least on behalf of Dr. Ball is at an all time high.  Try dealing with  issues such as this after seeing patients & in a PRIVATE setting.  Next to the fact the woman he was telling off was the mother of his unborn child.",2025-02-25|2024-07-31|2024-03-24|2023-09-14|2023-02-14|2023-05-18|2024-02-13|2023-08-28,2|5|5|5|5|5|1|2,,,"12 p.m.|11 a.m.|1 p.m.",84.75|84.5|81,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Does he help w pain mgmt","Yes dr valente has helped me tremendous success",pain_management_services|surgery_services|physical_therapy|medication_management|injection_treatments|extended_hours|online_appointment_booking|telemedicine_available|board_certified_physicians|friendly_staff|experienced_doctors|multiple_locations|efficient_service|thorough_care|comfortable_waiting_area|multilingual_staff_available,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ0TuZ69mr3IgR4YbokJpzzE4,65

He is truly an amazing doctor. His bed side manner is always caring and loving. No matter the hour he always returns my calls as soon as possible. The way he took my pain away in my back, I am truly greatful and I referre him and his staff all the time. If you have pain of any kind this is the office to come too.|My wife and I were patients with poto for 8 years. This doctor admitted to hitting my wife's nerve while injecting her back which has resulted in her having pain in her lower area that continues years later. Poto has not seen either of us for the past 5 years and tossed us around to other staff members. Carol is a wonderful person but obviously doesn't stand up for her patients. After 7 years we came in 13 minutes late and his staff thought it would be funny to reschedule us for 2 weeks out. Our medication ran out and they couldn't care less. The staff has been changed out constantly. Poto got one staff member pregnant and she brought in a bunch of angry rude staff members. My wife and I are very disappointed with how poto has changed, he was very concerned when we were his first patients as you can see by my previous review 7 years ago. He even had us come to his home where he gave us our prescriptions and befriended us. Thankfully we found a great place to get excellent treatment closer to home. We will never forgive poto for the treatment we received and hopefully we can still get compensation for the pain and suffering my wife deals with because of his negligence.|I am very bless to have a Dr. like Dr. Poto. He genuinely cares about his patients. How I know is because I have been near death and he came to my rescue, when I couldn't get out of bed he came to my house to see about and my mom . I can't say enough about Dr. Poto. And the Office of Pioneer Pain is excellent,everyone is very friendly knowledgeable and helpful.|Dr poto is one of the best Dr i ever known, he cares like family and he always make you feel like your his only patient,I have know him for years he is always kind and gentle and listen to what you have to say, and makes a game plan for your healthcare,dosent matter what you have going he always makes the time for his patient, I love him like family and he will always be apart of our family!!!!|I've been in pain with my neck and back for years with degenerative disc disease and have been to all kinds of pain management clinics.
I finally found a doctor that knows what he's doing! Dr. Poto is the first doctor I found I can trust! When he does procedures they work and has helped with areas of pain that I have had to deal with for years.
In the past, other doctors have done the exact same procedure and I didn't get any pain relief. Now I see why, either they didn't know what they were doing or they lacked the experience doing the procedure correctly!
I wish I had found him earlier.|I cannot say enough great things about Dr. Poto, his staff and office. First the intake process is thorough. The dr reviews your records and gets to know you before you arrive. He is the most knowledgable physician I have had in a long time. Despite being brilliant, Dr. Poto is friendly and very personable. He offered solutions that no other dr in Florida offered. In the past, I researched how to be helped and only 1 specific dr in NY or AZ offered what he has offered. I do not need to travel out of state for real help. He cares. He WANTS to help you. I saw Dr. Warsch and Dr. Weidenbaum at PainCare of Florida and those two drs combined never offered or helped me as much as Dr. Poto.  We are so lucky to have a dr like him in little old PSL.|I've been a patient of Dr.Poto's since he opened Pioneer Pain Management on US 1 in Port St Lucie, Florida. You WILL NOT find a more Personable and Professional pain management Doctor anywhere in Florida. He's truly ""Old School!"". By that, I mean that he takes an interest in each of his patients lives and how their condition affects them daily. He then takes the time to pick a pain management plan and explains every step of his plan with his patients.
So if you're reading this to find a pain management Doctor, LOOK NO FURTHER! You've found THE BEST!!!. Good Luck to you all and I hope that you're feeling better soon...|I have been treated for my severe degenerative disc disease, spondylitis & osteoarthritis. When I met him the first visit I knew he was the one who could help me. My pain has diminished drastically. He is the most caring, understanding, & listens to you.

The former doctor who was amazing Dr. Geiger who left the office back in the latter part of 2023. This iswho I was seeing. After she left I was in search of another pain management facility, because I had heard from patients that Dr. Von Tobel's bed side manner was rude and condescending. I made an appointment and saw the nurse practitioner Von Tobel. After submitting a urine sample she came to me and asked me(pretty much accusing) of taking two narcotics and said it was in my urine sample. I explained to her that it couldn't be because one of the medications she was accusing me of I am deathly allergic so why would I take it. And the other medicine I hadn't had since my surgery. I told her that maybe the mistakes my urine for someone elses. She said they don't make mistakes and asked me did I take someone else's medication. I was livid. I left feeling angry, hurt and as if I didn't matter as a patient. I clearly was not being listened to.

I didn't go back, until recently. Having no choice because of unbearable pain and the fact that my insurance isn't accepted by any other pain management. So I'm basically stuck getting care by Drs who thinks I'm a pain pill seeking junkie.|Today I received a procedure for low back pain and my experience was absolutely amazing my pain relief was instant relief. I highly recommend Dr Von Tobel if you want real pain relief! He is the best Dr Vvonderful!|The Dr and his staff are great. I had injections done yesterday and it went great. I was extremely nervous and Brittany was great at calming me down and walking me through everything and staying with me the whole time. Best office I have been to in a long time. They truly care.|I visited Dr. Von Tobel probably half a dozen times in the process of receiving two minor procedures. In that time, my pain progressed significantly and remains to be debilitating in nature... but that's not even my major gripe. I was most put off by the fact that, despite a few of the staff being really awesome (you know who you are), the majority of the personnel is wildly unprofessional and seemingly oblivious. The doctor, himself, is arrogant and condescending. I never spoke with him more than a few quick and/or interrupted sentences before he jogged back out of the door. On one occasion, he told me that I needed to make better money so I could buy decent insurance, but that was hardly the only or most offensive thing he ever said to me.

Ironically, not long after, my increased income had made me ineligible for said insurance, and the replacement plan I purchased would not go into effect untol after a scheduled appointment I had with him. In the interest of attending the appointment, I asked whoever fields their calls for information about paying out of pocket for the visit. I was told that I would owe $175. That seemed more than reasonable, so I arrived on the set date. I was short on money, and asked to be invoiced for the fee, but was told in no uncertain terms that invoicing a self pay patient was simply not possible, and I'd need to pay the cost in full,  or I couldn't be seen by the doctor. So, I did just that.

Finally, long after the the scheduled time of my appointment, I was called back to provide a sample for the quick, mandatory urinalysis. From from there, I finally spoke with one of the nurses. It was then, that I was told the the doctor was not even at the office, he'd have to call me back. On my way out, I stopped to schedule my next procedure, but learned that she was not there either. I'd be waiting on two calls...

No calls ever came. When I contacted the office the following day to let them know, I was again instructed to wait on the same calls - and I got the same result. Nothing. That was weeks ago, and those calls never came. Now, imagine my surprise when I discovered that, despite being too busy to return my call, Von Tobel had found time to INVOICE ME for a $1200 piss test. Unbelievable.|My epidural that Dr. von Tobel gave me was outstanding. I would recommend this procedure to anyone with the same pain that I had. His staff is outstanding as well! If you have any problems with Pain please visit doctor Travis von tobel and his amazing staff they are a God sent miracle|Dr. Von Tobel is a legit HEALER and checks all the boxes that one would want in a Physician. He is smart, compassionate, and an excellent communicator. He is the best Doctor I have ever crossed paths with and I am so grateful that he is the one that is helping me with my back issues. Every office visit I come away impressed with the high level of customer service his staff provides. Quick shoutout to his staff members Melissa, Dani, & Chels for going above and beyond in assisting me on multiple fronts. I am forever grateful guys.|I have had chronic back pain for years and have gone to other pain physicians and all others just wanted to throw pills at you and none of the other physicians never suggested procedures to stop the pain.  I had 3 broken vertebrae. The Doctor did a procedure 3 weeks and I can I highly recommend this office. honestly say I am close to being pain free. If you are looking for relief and not pills  see these Doctors today.|Let me start by saying the staff was great but my experience with the doctor wasn't. My first appointment was in a bank that they turned into a doctor office... They asked me to fill out paperwork with pronouns and other ways to identify myself. I wrote on my application 2 or more races but when the doctor did my intake he changed it to what he identified me as. If he had done this with my pronouns I would easily have a lawsuit. After that he scheduled me for an appointment to give me a shot in my lower back. I called in before my appointment to ask additional questions because no one really told me what kind of shot it was or any side effects. When I called for some reason it rang into the doctor's office and when I asked questions he said he will answer the questions while I'm on the table during the procedure... I thought this was suspicious but I was in so much pain for so long I decided to go with it. After the procedure I was in excruciating pain for 3 days. I originally only had problems with my left side but then my right side started hurting. I decided not to follow up for obvious reasons. When my auto injury case finally settled I had a bill from this doctor for over $10,000 for 2 doctor's visits. It has been almost a month and we haven't heard how or why I was charged this excessive amount.",2024-07-08|2024-08-29|2024-02-07|2023-11-11|2024-01-10|2023-07-08|2023-05-30|2023-02-27,2|5|5|1|5|5|5|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|friendly_staff|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ83_UbwDL5YgRWW0lugy6otM,54

They have charged me and my insurance for test that were not performed. I have notified my insurance carrier and the Doctors office but they still are billing me for test never performed. I actually have the documentation of the error and that I am correct.

I have spoken with several people in the billing office who say they will fix the problem. Then the following month, they bill me again. Hard to speak to the billing office, usually goes to voice mail but they do not return calls.

My next step will probably be to bring counsel into the matter to protect my credit.

I would avoid this office at all cost.|UPDATE - This office has had a change in administration/ownership resulting in Betsy no longer being there. So, DON'T bother! She was the best thing Dr. Weidenbaum had going for him. Definitely their loss.

Not sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of securing an appointment. I was taken into the exam room a few minutes early. Dr. Reganbaum's MA was professional and efficient.

I tell everyone to go see him because he will help you with your pain issues. Thank you Dr. Reganbaum.|I am sweetly blown away with the care being received from Dr. Regenbaum and his team.

He dove right into my mess of diagnosis' and prognosis' and offered me help and hope. He has already provided a lumbar epidural with a neck one to come soon. His, and my, goal of not needing pain medication seems possible and probable, thank You, LORD!

His compassion from the first appointment sets him apart huge, in and of itself, but the overall experiences have been as pleasant as possible with chronic pain and added mental wellness issues.

From the moment you walk in, there's signs everywhere about opiate prescriptions and cannabis cards. Every client in there looked and acted high. The doctor Benni table side manner was cold and uncaring. Which was a shock to me bc I thought I had finally found a clinic that cared about exploring treatment options for my chronic pain as well as continuing the course of treatment I was on. He did not care about discussing different treatments with me, nor did he want to discuss any medication options with me. He basically offered me at home neck traction and a rolled up towel. I'm 32 and have a severe injury in my neck and lower back that requires occasional medication and steroids and he was extremely disinterested and almost annoyed I came there to seek out treatment for an actual injury.|Dr. Benni stands above his class.

UPDATE 10/2023
I've been seeing Dr benni for about a year now. For over a year I've been seeig a dermatologist for an unknown facial rash that won't go away. It's ruined my social life and work life. Dr. benni was kind enough to notice and today he started to help me find a way to get rid of the rash. Ways that my dermatologist never did. I am thankful he's taking on a task that he did not have to do. I just want my skin back to the way it was and he seems more. Eager to help than my own derm.

DERRASARI
I gave this group 5 STARS 6 months  ago when Dr. Resham Datta was on staff. Since Dr. Datta left I have had nothing but PROBLEMS!!! The last 3 months have been a very arduous experience as a patient.
Since being ""taken care of"" by Gloria and Dr. Derrasari my perscriptions have been incorrect each month, Gloria always seems confused during our in-person conversations and is extremely disorganized.
Dr. Derrasari has zero compassion or accountability for the communication errors between him and his staff.
I NEVER receive return phone calls after leaving numerous messages.
I am so disappointed Dr. Datta is gone, it turns out she was the rare gem for FPM and now I will also be leaving FPM as a patient but I'm certain they do NOT care. Only bright light is the nurses and support staff are still AMAZING!!!|Was referred by my Primary. Called and was told some manager would call me back, within a week, to set an appointment. It's been 13 days and no one has called.|It's Oct 22nd, 2020: 1030AM EXACTLY.

Just left this place 5 min ago after being told:  ""I was late for my 1030apt"". The lady at the desk said I would need to reschedule which I live over an hour away.... When I asked how am I late, it's only 1022 (pointed to my watch) and the lady said new patients need to come in early to fill out paperwork.   I said I understand that but I'm not late for my 1030apt and technically showing up at 10:29 is still showing up early.

If you need a patient to show up at a specific time, then BOOK them for that time. Don't assume that telling someone to ""SHOW UP EARLY"" is some form of universal language of time that correlates to 15 min or 30 min etc.

Very rude
Very unprofessional

They will schedule twenty (plus) patients appointments at any given time. They lock the door at lunch, unlocking it once they feel like it even though there's twenty people waiting in the rain because they have 1pm appointments and it's 1:15pm. They will make you wait hours to see someone (rarely the actual doctor) and if you are 15 minutes late you are out of luck.

I do not recommend this office. I'm leaving this office after I leave this message. They are the worst? I gave them two months in a row and they've dropped the ball.|I have chronic kidney pain. I understand that I can't take opioids because I get constipated easily. But they will not let me get anything else and I still have to be under their care. I'm in pain and they will not help me relieve it. Told me to continue taking my fibromyalgia meds which is for nerve pain not chronic pain from organs.|I've been dealing with chronic back and neck problems for over 10 years. No one has even come close to giving me any relief until I found Dr. Foltz. Not only does he care about his patients but he explains things so you understand. I recommend Florida pain physicians to anyone who has not found relief at other places. Don't give up these people will help you. I just adore the staff from the front all the way through the office.|I came as a new patient. Everything was great fast-forward four procedures 12 appointments and the last five months I did not see my doctor once. I was always scheduled with the nurse for them to ask me to schedule a surgery. I did not see the doctor for five months, I found a new doctor and told them I wouldn't be going there anymore. He cut off my medical marijuana card cash which was separate from my other visits cash payment and instead of allowing it to expire. He went in spitefully cut it off. I already had my orders in there. I wasn't due for more orders for another three months spiteful Front desk was nasty. The nurses didn't know what they were doing. I went there with a broken screw in my back and they did not find it in a year and a half. I had to find it myself with the imaging that I requested. This office is become too busy , too many patients too much staff and they keep striving for more and more and more money. Ridiculous.|A friend insisted that I needed to make an appointment with Dr. Foltz. I honestly was not getting my hopes up that this would result in anything better than my previous experience with 20+ years of pain management. My new patient consult with Dr. Foltz was the most comprehensive and compassionate appointment I believe I have ever had with a physician. Dr. Foltz fully listened to all of my concerns in such a manner that made me so comfortable and heard. I left that day with so much hope for a better quality of life. He made a plan of action for my care and over a year later I am happy to say that I feel better than I have in years. He has an incredible, friendly staff that make each visit from beginning to end go so smoothly and they are all just so pleasant to interact with.  April, the PA that I see for my followup appointments between procedures continues to guide my care like none other, she is so very kind and phenomenal at what she does and is clearly dedicated to finding treatment suggestions that are best for her patients. One of her suggestions for me was to start physical therapy with their on site therapist, Brian. He has been hands down the best physical therapist I have worked with, and I have had many over the years. The communication between these caregivers has been a game changer in my pain management journey.  I am so thankful that my friend led me to this practice. I wish I could give them more than the 5 stars above. Their combined care has given me such a gift and I along with my family are so very grateful.|Dr. Foltz and his team are amazing. I have been to different pain Drs who are only about the money and have no real care. The staff at this practice was amazing.

He is very patient and kind and also a very caring person which makes a difference. He is willing to go the extra mile to make sure all his patients are well cared for and all their concerns are heard. The front end staff is always lovely every visit very warm and welcoming|I went here in regards to pain management due to a bad auto accident. While I was seeing Dr. Melvin, my attorney referred my case to another attorney due to medical reasons. That will matter later. The procedures that Dr. Melvin recommended to relieve my pain my insurance will not cover as it's related to an auto accident. I had an LOP with this office and my previous attorney. The office had continued to send me bills for services I was told would be under the LOP. Instead of telling me upfront they cancelled my LOP because *I* changed attorneys without telling them (which is false, my attorney did that for me, I never wanted to and how was I supposed to know that was their rule?), they tried to pacify me for months like falsely telling me that if I had medical insurance, I had to utilize my medical benefits before using PIP benefits or LOP benefits (my case was grandfathered before that change in the law but I guess these people are not detail-oriented even though this line of work demands it). Moreover, I pointed out what do they mean ""if"" someone has medical insurance? Isn't everyone required to have medical insurance under ACA? The office assistant was very rude toward me, saying ""Well I'm not going to get into a political debate with you."" That woman is very unpleasant and unprofessional, which basically sums up this office. To circle back, I could not use medical benefits because it's auto-related, and the LOP no longer existed but they failed to mention that detail (again, not detail-oriented). I pointed all this out to Dr. Melvin for a $30K procedure (which by the way of course doesn't have a return policy if it doesn't work...), and he did not care in the slightest. He simply said I would have to pay in cash then, to which I asked, who has $30K sitting around? I guess he does because he is clearly only after money and not after the well-being of his patients. That's when he broke the news that my LOP was cancelled. So I asked why can't we just do an LOP with my new attorney, so I can get the procedure done? He said he doesn't know my attorney...so did he know my last one? Does he meet all attorneys? Or did he just not care, and didn't want to help me anymore? This review is really not about how broken this system is, but wanted to give a wholistic view of my experience here, which is what I'm reviewing. Which deserves negative stars if given the opportunity. Go to another office that is more patient-oriented and not cash-oriented.|Doctor Melvin and his staff performed injections. So far it really helped. He is very professional and he really took away some pain. Second round today. Staff and nurses are very sweet and professional.

My great experience began back in November 2024 as I walked through their doors frustrated and in pain. I was greeted by Greta and Neri who took the time to welcome me to the clinic and address my issues and concerns. They actually saw me as a person who needed medical attention and proceeded to get me the help I needed.

Their compassion and commitment to excellence has set the tone for customer service and has restored the confidence and  belief that great quality and customer care is still alive. I saw Dr. Laura Gill and before we proceeded with any type of medical conversation, she took the time to know me as the person and not the patient, in other words she valued me as an individual. I also must add she is really great at her job. There is no exploratory process, she is all about the root cause.

Great job guys and keep up the great work.|I made several different appointments each time i came for my appointment that was a problem first time the dr gill was not in the orange park the next time there was a problem they said I was not scheduled for the procedure this was three times in a row there was a problem with getting the procedure
I really like dr Gill I don't know if the person who handles the schedules is incompetent or is not organized. I will have to find another place where it is more organized and am able to get the treatment that will help me with my pain.|For the very 1st time in 25 years that I am pain free! Dr. Laura Gil is the kind of doctor that listens and she goes above and beyond for her patients. I don't even know how to thank her.|My experience with Dr. Avila has been the absolute best. Ive had a total of 6 surgeries on my spine. When I had my very first consultation with him, he was very professional, humble, the best bedside manner from any physician I have ever known, and he takes his time explaining the procedures on what to expected. Not only that, he is bilingual! So his Spanish speaking patients feel a sense of trust, hope, and understanding-it give a sense of peace and security for the Spanish speaking community. Dr. Avila really makes you feel like family. He looks out for YOUR best interest not from a money stand point. His office staff are very sweet, personable, and very kind. I highly recommend Dr. Avila and his practice for your pain needs!!!|I can't speak highly enough of Dr. Gil and her phenomenal team. From the moment I walked through their doors, I knew I was in excellent hands. Dr. Gil's professionalism, combined with her genuine care and attention to detail, made my experience truly exceptional.

One of the most remarkable aspects of my interaction with Dr. Gil and her team was their unwavering commitment to listen. They took the time to understand my concerns, answer my questions, and tailor their approach to my individual needs. This level of personalized care is rare and greatly appreciated.

Moreover, Dr. Gil's expertise is unmatched. She not only addressed my immediate concerns but also provided valuable insights and guidance for maintaining optimal health in the long term. Her dedication to staying current with the latest advancements in her field is evident, and it instilled confidence in me throughout the entire process.

Beyond their professional competence, Dr. Gil and her team exude warmth and kindness. They create a welcoming environment where patients feel valued and respected. Every interaction, whether in person or over the phone, left me feeling cared for and supported.

Dr. Gil and her team exceeded all my expectations. They not only delivered outstanding medical care but also demonstrated genuine compassion and empathy. My first impression of them was nothing short of extraordinary, and I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone seeking top-notch healthcare.|Dr. Avila is amazing and I have never had a painless procedure, until I met him.  He is fast, meticulous, and gentle with his patients.  I didn't even realize he was injecting my back as he was doing it, other than him informing me, lol.|If you have learned to hate pain clinics like I have, I can tell you, Dr. Avil is the exception.

Especially a young man named Gared. He is something like a savant when it comes to healthcare. They took there time with me and explained everything so I could understand. They even went the extra mile when Gared called me after my procedure to check to see how I was feeling.|Dr Joseph Cartwright has been my pain physician for 7+ years. I highly recommend Dr Cartwright to anyone experiencing chronic pain. He is personable, observant, always thinking of the patient's best interest and a great doctor to have on your medical team!|Never go to get treated at this facility in St. Augustine or you will encounter rude, belittling, uncaring, and unprofessional front desk employees named Heather, Maria, & Jennifer. I have been a patient of Dr. Friedenstein  for 6 years and I am a disabled 74 year old widow in current treatment for severe pain in my back. Yet , I was turned away from the office this week without being able to see the doctor or make the important appointment for my radiofrequency ablation back shot. That is because these incompetent women failed in their duties and did not properly notify me that the doctor was on vacation all week, and the PA Matthew Bonin left on emergency. I was essentially stood up unable to see any doctor and wasting my whole day. When I asked to see a part of my record which was my recent x ray and MRI report, I was also refused! They said a doctor had to go over them with me, which is absolutely false....it is a HIPAA violation to withhold a patient's own medical records from them .Who would not be upset in this situation? I voiced my frustrations to the girls pointing out that their company charges a fee for canceling less than 24 hours before, and yet they knew the doctor was out, and they didn't give me the decency to call until 2 hours before my appointment and then never even relay the info to the call center that Matthew was gone. I had called to check and the call center said that my appointment was still scheduled and Matthew would be there. They gave me an appointment card for next week when the doctor returns. So, essentially, these girls were goofing off, not doing their jobs, chatting at the front desk, because both of their Dr. bosses were gone for the day! They had messed up, but they did not like me telling me they did. I was so rightly upset I was mumbling under my breath as I walked to the door, as I opened the door, one shouted across the room loudly patronizing me and mocking my anger, ""Have a nice Day""!!! The next day, I get a call from a Jennifer who proceeds to start rattling off something about that I can no longer see the doctor.!!!!  I stopped her dead cold. I told her I didn't know who she was but if she even tries to mess with me there will be legal manifestations. I hung up. I think these girls are somehow trying to dismiss me so the doctor doesn't hear about their misbehavior in all of the doctor's absence that day. I cannot believe they don't know that health practitioners cannot just dismiss patients who are in 'continuity of care.' They also can't dismiss patients for discriminatory reasons such as disabilities. Dismissal of a patient is only done as a last resort after a continued misbehavior or infraction. There is a set process to dismiss a patient laid out by the AMA and the Florida Medical Association. To not follow these rules is called 'patient abandonment' and can have civil liability and a doctor can lose his license over it. So, I don't know who this bottom- of- the -ladder- girl Jennifer is that tries to call me over the phone and tries to tell me that I can't see my doctor anymore who I rely on for pain medications and back shots is..but her action is absolute abuse! And it goes to show what lengths some employees will go to cover their own shortcomings. Too bad for them that I have proof on my phone of their voice messages with their names trying to cancel my appointment only two hours before. So please be leary. Dr Friedenstein is a great doctor, but members of his staff care nothing about you if you are elderly and disabled.. They will mock, slander, and abuse you if you dare need to expose them for their incompetency and uncaring behavior.|Been going to Dr. Cartwright for years to treat spine issues with epidural injections. Cartwright is knowledgeable and genuinely caring. I would attribute his skills in helping me avoid more surgeries. When it was clear I needed immediate surgical help he facilitated getting in with a surgeon the next day!|After 10 years at a different pain doctors I found the best for pain. Seeing them for the last six months of treatment and injections, life is so much better. The staff is kind , the office is clean .along with being pleasant .Injections are done for your comfort. During the period I have been seening them I fell after .I got home the hospital they were right here for me. Thank you Florida Coast for your caring healing.|I had amazing experience with this office- originally made the appointment because I was having an issue with my back but the night before fell on my knee and injured it- Dr. Foltz- advised me that I had probably torn my meniscus and needed to see a surgeon.  I did, in fact tear my meniscus and need surgery!  I did rehab with George- who really knows his stuff and I am back to work!!
Abby and Moriah-at the front desk- know how to treat patient's with a kind heart!   The assistant's- help Dr. Foltz- with all he needs so the office run as smooth as possible!  You are treated like a person- not a number at this office!!  The only time I can ever see anyone not getting the care they need- is when they are not doing their part!!
Thank you for your care!!|Dr. Foltz is an amazing pain doctor! I wish I could go to him for EVERYTHING... except groceries.  The nurses (and assistants)  are so friendly, give GREAT hugs and make you feel like you're just coming by to talk to old friends!
Being a gun shot wound survivor, leading to the amputation of my right leg, constant pain was just my ""new normal"". I never thought I would see a day free of pain.  I never thought, that is, until I visited Florida Pain Physicians and Dr. Foltz.  Because of Doc and the staff, I can go out and throw the ball with my son and dance with my daughter without wincing in pain. Thank you, Dr. Foltz, the wonderful nurses/assistants (Lois, Sarah, Kyra (etc.)) and Florida Pain Physicians!|Capt foltz is an excellent doctor. Glad to have him back as my pain doctor after having him in the navy. Staff is friendly also.   Capt. Folts breaks thing down so anyone can understand. He listens to patients and makes sure patients are comfortable. He is one of the best pain doctors in all of Jacksonville. He doesn't run test you don't need and does a through assessment. Capt foltz is a navy doctor that knows what he is doing and will do you any harm and will do what is in the best interests of the patients. Also brian is one of the best physical therapy around he is just like capt foltz and  naval hospital Jacksonville should hire him to do work there when not at Florida pain physician all of southeast orthopedic should come here.

Although I had one dr at the waldemere office I wasn't crazy about once I moved to the office in Lakewood ranch I've been happy. Dr. Goel has done many successful procedures on me and the front office staff are super sweet. I've had issues with pharmacies not getting orders or dealing with pre authorization on certain medications but outside of that it's all great. Never a long wait in office . When I ask for modifications to medication and for imaging or injections they accommodate me. Also on a side note Amy is amazing and makes me feel heard. I'm having major knee surgery and have felt super overwhelmed with my recovery time and she listens to me and makes plans based on what I actually need.

As a side note I should mention this is not a ""pill mill"" they advocate for safe opioid use which is in our best interest . I wish I didn't need medication at all but I went off a bridge in my car many years ago and it's taken a toll on me . Even that being said I take the lowest dose medication possible knowing I'll likely need something for the rest of my life I don't want to build up a tolerance so high I have to take massive amounts of medication to control the pain. I hope if you are taking these medications you do so responsibly.|Well they won't see me as a patient there and basically insinuated that I was a drug addict funny though the same 60 pills they gave me back in September I've got about 55 of them left yeah I'm a big drug addict freaking hilarious!!! I just wanted help controlling my pain and they couldn't even offer that instead they offered for me to go see somebody else thanks! I'll be sure not to recommend you to anybody and if they ask my opinion I'll be sure to tell them the truth. I should have known when you were making everybody wear mask in the office when it wasn't even mandatory, which mandatory doesn't even mean it's law. But if we didn't wear a mask you wouldn't see us ridiculous it's not even a regular physician it's just pain management!!! The weird thing is is about a year ago I was seeing this doctor and everything was fine until I saw his assistant whoever she is Then they had to have a meeting and decided that I could no longer be their patient I guess y'all did me a favor maybe now I'll actually get somebody who can help me! Because this pain is ridiculous and it's hard to function some days but I will wait till I'm practically dying before I will take a pain pill so there there's that!!! Good luck to your practice and I will be praying for you!!! God knows you need it!!! Because the way you treat your patience is not very humble.|Dr. Goel doesn't care about his patients plain and simple! I have a hernia and degenerative disease and arthritis, he took me off my pain meds and didn't prescribe anything else after seeing him for two years. I'm in serious pain and he and his staff dismiss it, time to find a doctor that genuinely cares for their patients!! Definitely DO NOT recommend his practice by any means possible.|This is the worst place ever. I went there for pain they prescribed me medication. About three hours later I call Walgreens asking if they received the prescription they said no so I called back the pain relief center explained to the lady that Walgreens is saying that they haven't received the prescription keep in mind this is 3 hours later. She goes off on me telling me oh well obviously it hasn't been sent yet. Just disrespectful The whole process just didn't make sense.  so the next day I call Walgreens an still haven't received the prescription. Had to call back the pain management again the lady tells me the manager will contact me. Long story short i had to go to another doctor. I WOULD NEVER GO BACk OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO THIS PLACE|I have been a patient of Dr. Goels for many years and beforehand I had to look back and see my history. It's been almost 7 years I have consistently been going to Tampa pain relief and Sarasota pain relief centers. However, my last visit was a complete utter debacle, and I cannot bring myself to almost go back, first of all, I have never heard one response from Dr. Goel about the situation and second the practitioner LeBron is clueless. We have tried to somehow fix her mess up with my medication and it is still not been properly corrected. I called and left a message to speak to the office manager of the centers and still have yet to receive a reply. This place has just gone completely downhill. I've had so many different providers. My head is still spinning. So if you have a choice to find a pain relief center find out exactly who you're going to see in the office just a completely disappointed patient|Dr. Amitabh Goel is an extremely professional and experienced physician that cares about his patients. I would highly recommend him to anyone that is dealing with symptoms of chronic pain.|WORST pain management center EVER!!! I went here due to my C6 and C7 vertebrates in my neck being out of place and degenerative disc disease in my L4 &L5 lumbar. I am a type one Diabetic on an insulin pump. All of my current medications and my health conditions were given to them prior to the appointment.

They told me I could bring in my paperwork and disc to the appointment and then tried to cancel the appointment on me 15 minutes prior to my arrival. When I told them I had everything with me they told me I could come.

I showed up with other patients in the waiting room. One was almost in tears because they kept asking her the same question over and over. Another patient walked in and said she needed her medicine called in and since they never answer their phone she had to drive all the way to the office in pain.

I finally get to see the NP and she tells me she can't help me with anything for pain because it would interfere with the medicine I was already on. Then she tells me she can't even help me with neck injections because I am a type one diabetic and steroids would make my blood  sugars shoot through the roof. Her conclusion was for me to just leave and go to a surgeon AFTER they took my insurance and $60 co-pay OF COURSE.

She blamed it all on the front desk for not doing their job. I really hope they do not try to waste time processing this through my insurance because I will fight it. Thankfully I wasn't self-pay. It seems like all they want is your money.  Also, seems like they would rather drug you up on opioids rather than use medicine that I already know works best for me. I'll take my money elsewhere with doctors who care.

I wish I would have read the negative reviews BEFORE I even made an appointment!|Paid over $1500 for two office visits and an epidural shot for back pain. After follow-up visit, Dr. Goel asked if my leg pain improved!?!  UNBELIEVABLE!!  Most of The office and Doctor are Completely clueless. If it was $5K I would've obtained an attorney and sued them! Worst medical experience of my life!

I arrived prepared, MRI disc in hand, but felt like just another checkbox on an endless list of forms and processes. After lengthy questionnaires, I was met with the all-too-familiar ""go here, go there, we'll be right with you"" routine.

When I finally saw a PA, it felt more like a sales pitch than a genuine consultation--almost as though I needed to convince them my condition deserved real attention. The ""triage"" was painfully impersonal, like a fill-in-the-blank script that could have been handled in an email. My MRI? Pointless, since they ""didn't have the equipment"" to read it--read: no radiologist on staff.

In the end, I walked out with no treatment plan, no genuine understanding, and an appointment in two weeks. It's clear they have a rigid approach: when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. For a pain clinic, empathy and flexibility seem sorely lacking.

Update: received a very unprofessional phone call from the doctor, after this review went up.  (2hr after the appointment)

He called stating he heard I had some ""questions,"" then used that time to clear up my expectations of being pain free and how my understanding about living life in chronic pain is flawed.  I've never been reprimanded by a doctor, I've never met, over the phone, for such a thing. He casually offered me two things... my right to go to another clinic, knowing the complications involved with the VA Community Care referral system or I could just keep my follow up as scheduled, if I want.

So.... Expect any and all frustrations to be held against you, here. Or have your case management being used as a tool of control instead of continuity.|I unfortunately had a car accident. The first appointment Dr. Reeves said he was gonna help me through this process. Everyone has been extremely helpful and friendly.

His office staff is friendly & efficient and made me feel welcome. Dr. Henriquez listened carefully to my concerns regarding my pain. He was able to offer me several options for treating my pain immediately & for the long term. I was very pleased with the care I received. I highly recommend Dr. Henriquez.|I went to see Dr Henriquez after extreme disappointment with 2 other pain physicians who failed to help me. After years of pain, I can finally start enjoying life again .....he did some facet injections ...No more nerve pain.
He is a wonderful, kind and very talented Dr|Dr Henriquez is an excellent doctor and a wonderful person. Always calm, friendly and a smile. As a former nurse, I can assure you that he is a top notch doctor. His care plans and his skills in doing procedures are always excellent. He has helped me so much and I am grateful. You can't find a better pain management doctor! The best.|I love dr Henriquez but the staff leaves much to be desired. I was in terrible back pain, saw his PA, on 3/25 had approval for the T4 procedure on 3/29. Then I called 4 times and got voice mail each time requesting a date for the procedure. No return call until 4/9 and couldn't get an appointment until 4/28. A doctor's office needs to respond immediately to voice mails for patients who are in trouble. I was terribly disappointed. I will pursue a pain management office in the North.|The staff at Family Spine and Pain Care Institute are great.  Dr. Omar Henriquez is such a great doctor.  He is patient and very knowledgeable who takes his time to explain to you the procedures and to makes sure he answers all your questions.  He truly treats you like a person and not a number and is concerned with the wellbeing of his patients to live a pain free life.  My only regret is that he is not in California, yet the trip that I make once a year to be treated by Dr. Henriquez is worth it because I am now living a pain free life.  I would highly recommend Dr. Henriquez to anyone struggling with back pain.|Dr Henriques is a wonderful doctor.  He is personable and an excellent doctor.  He was my pain doctor in Naples for many years before he moved to Venice. I immediately got set up as a new patient when I moved to Venice in May 2023.  His staff is very friendly as well.  They are all Compassionate and empathetic to your pain and needs.|The absolute best pain Doctor ever! I've been with Dr Henriquez for 8 years now! He's helped me so much. He listens, spends time diagnosing my problem and books my procedure to help alleviate my pain issues. I've referred many people to him for his expertise. The best ever! He's kept me out of a wheelchair while my old GP back in Illinois told me I only had a few years before I'd be in one! Dr H has done everything to keep me upright and walking!

I have a spine fusion comprising of the T2-T9 vertebrae. It's been 12 months since a 6 story fall that caused this and in that time I have pushed myself to the limit, battling unbelievable pain daily in physical therapy, the gym and work. I own and operate a multi unit business in the area. I have shocked the surgeons, family, friends, employees and the medical world in the progress that I have made. Unbelievable support from all directions. Except Kaba. The worst person in this entire process by far. I'm telling you unequivocally there are way better options than him. He was 30 mins late to appointments in the morning. Never was up to date on medical records and flat out acted like my father and I were lying in our first visit. Wears a mask even though he has it off around the staff in the background. Treats you like you're a junkie looking for a fix and doesn't absorb or have the communication skills to deal with varying medical situations. Clearly looks at everyone through his basic lenses and doesn't want to have to analyze and think on a person by person basis.|I've been a patient for over a year and Dr Kaba ,Ella and the rest of the staff are excellent. They're kind, courteous, and professional. I see Ella monthly and she's always great! I see Dr Kaba when I get shots and yesterday I had a nerve block that he helped me through as I couldn't receive sedation since I was driving myself. I really appreciated his concern.|On my last visit I was verbally mistreated by my Dr's nurse & I reported her to Fl Nursing Association & Human Resources. Other than that Dr Kaba and staff members are professionals willing to treat patients with care & love.|New patient!  Had my first appointment with Dr Kaba after a fall at work.  #3 - #4 disc issues pain level ... horrific muscle spasms in right shoulder pain is a 10.    Had my first set of injections in my shoulder blade on Monday NO PAIN in my shoulder slept great.  On to the back.
Dr. Kaba - a 10 in kindness and professionalism. Office staff is very kind as well. 

Forest is an asset to the clinic!!

Thank you|Staff is not very friendly, and in fact are rude, argumentative, and lazy.  It is like the patient becomes invisible. They don't provide much needed forms timely, if at all.  Unfortunately, Dr. Pham enables this lack of professionalism, as he would rather discharge a patient then address the staff and their behavior.  The office is rundown and  dirty, including the bathroom.  The lobby set up is not good not even for people with walkers and wheelchairs.   For the type of medical practice and disabled people like me who need a good ramp and automatic doors this office is sorely lacking.    I know all of them are professionals with their proper credentials and I don't have any doubts about their qualifications.   However, there is a feeling of low moral amongst the staff that projects as lack of interest on the patient.  I would be nice if the practice would address staff behavior,  did some remodeling updates to the front of door, the lobby, and most importantly,  train the staff in basic patient staff relations.  The Staff does not go a step above to make patients feel welcome or safe with their care. As for reviews complementing the staff, I'm sure that those are prepared by the staff to offset all of the reviews that complain about them. Make sure to read all reviews to get a true sense of how horrible this practice is.|Dr. Pham is very knowledgeable, caring, compassionate, and professional. I have been a patient here for 3.5 years and I have nothing but great things to say about them. The staff are friendly, courteous, and respect your time and privacy. Dr. Pham's assistants are very knowledgeable and review my health record and treatment at every appointment. I have seen Leslie Horn the most and she is fantastic! As of recent I have been seen by Forrest Saunders and he is great too! Overall, Advanced Interventional Pain Clinic offers exceptional care while making you feel like more than a patient!

Update 7/12/24: Exactly as stated above. Dr. Drahmane Kaba, MD and Forrest continue to deliver the best treatment and management of my chronic pain that I've ever received. This treatment has made a huge improvement in my daily functioning and in my relationships with family and friends. I never dread my appointments which makes it so much easier to mange. I appreciate the help of all of the staff there for making my life better.|I see a lot of Dr.'s - from the time I walk in to the time I leave,  I feel that the whole staff cares about my well being.  They are professional but friendly and caring.  Dr. Kaba is one of the best Dr.s I have been to and will continue to go to, because I know he cares and will do all he can to help me.|Everyone is caring. Forrest always asks how I am feeling and genuinely cares. My appointments are made quickly. My scripts are called in quickly. The place is spotless. You won't find a more caring staff any where.

So many times there was insurance issues, etc and staff was always helpful. I hated to leave, but relocated to another state.|Dr. Udeshi and his staff are wonderful! I have been seeing him for approximately 10 years now. Front office staff are always friendly. PA Melissa is down to earth, friendly, charming and informative. She really listens. Dr. Udeshi is wicked smart and always remembers you! I have multiple issues, fibromyalgia, CRPS, lumbar injuries as well. And on and on. Dr. Udeshi really takes his time with you, on the few times that he may be running behind I never ever mind because he absolutely will be calm and patient and give me the time that I might need during my appointment. I completely trust this man, he has done several ablations on my lumbar, even my feet a few times. He and his staff keep me going, I have an active family and I am able to get the things I need to get done thanks to his education, kindness and amazing surgeon hands! He is a very kind man and I would be devasted if I ever had to change doctors! I can understand that there may be issues here and there with staffing and gosh help us insurance! I haven't had any problems thankfully and it's more important to me to see a doctor that I love so much and trust so much as well. I am super grateful for Dr. Udeshi and his staff both at the Palm Bay office and the Merritt Island office where I go for my procedures. Excellent and friendly, I truly am living a better life thanks to these amazing people! Thank you Dr. Udeshi, Melissa and staff for all you do!|The office staff should be fired. I went there on a referral and didn't even make it thru intake. Rude and unprofessional.|Honestly I just can't fathom that your office has completely left me high and dry and with no guidance, support, or help with my authorization issue.....
especially since I confirmed with my insurance company that the appeal you sent them, in fact, did have the wrong member number on it.

My insurance company called your office last week, after Tai, Ashley, and Lauren threw this issue back at me, and left a very detailed message regarding what happened and what needed to be done to rectify it. I'm pretty positive you've done nothing with that information. And that is no surprise.

I guess you have all proven that the patient is not important, customer service is not important, and being accountable, for an error that could've been easily corrected, is not important.

I am just shocked at the turn of events after having such a great experience with Dr. Udeshi when I first visited the office in October. I really wonder how he would feel if he knew how your behavior and lack of concern or customer service has lost him a patient that raved about the service, treatment, and relief I received with a prior issue.

I did my part and you all failed miserably at yours.

*****Update after receiving your response*****

I went to your website to contact you as you've requested and there is no 'contact us' option. This entire office/practice/business is a joke. You've got my name. If you actually do care, you can find me and inquire about the details of my experience.|Due to the unprofessionalism of the staff and doctors, I do not recommend this place at all because they play with the patients lives. After having an appointment for a procedure they have canceled not 1 but 3 times with ridiculous excuses and still stop me from taking pills that I need daily, they don't care at all. They have made me take blood tests every time they reschedule appointments, in addition to the expense of gasoline, of my time, and they did not solve my medical problem. It's the worst medical place I've ever been.|Very disappointed in how patients are treated.  Doctors do not return calls, most of the staff was rude. Because of concern with treatment of my daughter and lack of empathy we were released.  Found a better and more understanding office.  We were not there for ""drugs"" we wanted to have issues fixed. Everything I had to say was inappropriate but yet their staff treated me inappropriately more than once.|Saw Dr E and loved him. They did anset of 3 shots which did not help. On my follow up they explained that I probably needed surgery and gave me a refferal. I called a few days later to see if they could give me anything for pain since it was 15 days until the neuro had an appt.  Office staff was very rude, treats you like your shopping for drugs. She told me I might be able to get a steroid pack. I asked her how that helps with pain and she said ""obviously we wouldnt give it if it didnt""  I have never heard of a steroid helpung with pain but she was not a gan of answering questions. I am sure I will never get a call back.|I showed up for my appointment 10 minutes early and used the Tele check in where I was placed on hold for 15 minutes. Then I was told to come up to the office. After waiting another 5 minutes I was told I was late for my appointment and the doctor wouldn't be seeing me. This cost me time from work oh and I still have to wait to be seen. I'll find another doctor.

Dr Seigal listened to everything I had to say and asked pertinent questions. All in all a pleasant experience.|Very professional staff staff and visit with Dr. Siegel. He was thorough in his review of records and the examination. I highly recommend this doctor.|SEE UPDATE TO THIS POST BELOW:  The doctor stopped listening. Said he didn't think he could do anymore for me. RFN bilaterally.  And the rest? Exercise on an inflamed joint? He wasn't listening to me. Asked the same questions I had just answered two minutes prior. He asked ""how did I know I had been given the shot I said I had been given by another doctor.  I reminded him it was also reflected in my file. I believe I'm done here. He is too arrogant for me. This doctor is not what I had hoped he would be.  He seems angry. Rather slams into the examining room. Patients don't need this kind of unprofessional attitude. And, I refuse to accept it any further either.  UPDATE  aUG. 2024.  Dr. Siegel did call me later and said it was certainly not his intention to make me feel shunned or to disregard my feelings. We discussed this further and he made another appointment for me to return to the office. I know of no other doctor in my recent past who has bothered to reach out like Dr. Siegel has done and brought me back into the fold.  I have since had another procedure and I am feeling much better and walk without so much pain. Dr. Siegel is the doctor I prefer to see for these cumbersome back issues. If you are in need of a good pain interventionalist, Dr. Siegel in Tamarac is the one to see.  You may also wish to speak to Ann-Marie in the office if you have any questions. She is a great help.|Dr.Siegel and his staff are phenomenal. They're a very professional, courteous and pleasant Drs office staff. Dr Siegel really listens to your problems and figures out the best treatment for you. My Chiropractor is the one who highly recommended Dr. Siegel to me and I'm glad he did. I have recommended his office to family and friends.|Office staff was very friendly and made me feel comfortable, the wait time was not bad and the Dr. was great. he listened and i Hope he can help me with the pain I live with daily.|I have unfortunately been in and out of lots of Dr's my whole life. Dr Siegel is one of the few that that actually cares and is up to date on the technology and procedures. He is caring and the staff are also very caring and good at their job. I never wait more than 5-10 minutes in the waiting room and its always a great experience that is helpful with the care I need to get me through my pain. If you have any issues this is the Dr to see. Great place!|I am so grateful for Dr. Siegel, his expertise and patience.

He's a very kind and thoughtful doctor and always takes the time to talk with me.
He is thoughtful in the respect that he offers alternative solutions to help with my pain management. He is never pushy or in a hurry where he won't take the time to talk with me and has been very helpful with injections to help with my neck pain.

He's a very down to earth person yet is always very professional!

I started with this practice in December of 2021. I had recently moved to Florida and was not happy about leaving my pain doctor in Georgia. I was referred to Dr. Sherman and found that on my first appointment he was very thorough and spent quite a bit of time reviewing my charts with me. He and his staff quickly hooked me up with the St. Jude's Rep in the area for my implant and we started a journey TOGETHER! After a couple of years, Dr.  Sherman and I discussed the idea of implanting a device to administer pain meds directly into my spine. After a couple of discussions, the process began and I started titrating down from my current dosage of pain meds (which was extremely high). As we were nearing the process of being able to do the trial for the device, I learned I would have to have a total knee replacement which halted moving toward the trial. At this time, I was on the lowest amount of pain medication that I had been prescribed since 2010. After my knee surgery, I was on more pain meds than I had ever been on in my life and when I returned to the practice, Dr. Sherman worked with me to return back to my normal doses of medication. It took a couple months and my drive to ""get off the meds"" that brought me to where I am today. After my pain medication was returned to the level just prior to my trial, it was decided that I would not need to proceed with the pain pump implant. I no longer needed that kind of control. So, now I am back down to the lowest amount of pain meds I have ever taken since my original back surgery was performed. I accredit this to Dr. Sherman and his staff. While not every day is ""coming up roses"" I can say that I feel better and am more active than I have ever been even after 4 back surgeries, a neurostimulator implant, 2 SI Joint Fusions, 1 Knee Replacement, and one Knee cleanout. I encourage patients to go in and speak with Dr. Sherman and take to heart what he is saying to you. Ask questions and research your options because I can promise you that this man will be honest and truthful with you even if the discussion is a hard one to have. His staff are always friendly and welcoming and I can promise you that even though they run a tight ship...they are there to support your needs each and every day!|Dr Scott Sherman is straight to the point with his patients but HE CARES. As a matter of fact I'm not sure I have met a single doctor who cares more about my well-being than him. He is professional and extremely qualified.
I have had 3 spine surgeries with the last being total reconstructive. Dr. Sherman help me put things in perspective, not just giving me pain meds but TEACHING me and I can't imagine how long I would have struggled if I had not met him in 2011!
Dr Sherman and staff, thank you SO much!!|I've been seeing Dr Sherman for years. I have chronic neck pain and have been limited with treatment options. Dr Sherman has been very supportive and patient. He's an exceptional doctor.

Metropolitan Pain Management Center is a great place to go to and get professional premier customer service. When you walk into their facility, you are greeted by their friendly customer service. They are there to give you the treatment you need. There is no need to go anywhere else. Stephanie, who works in the front office, greeted me with a friendly, professional, premier service. She explained to me what to fill out on the paperwork. Then, I was greeted by Dr. Salahi, who was also friendly with professional, premier service. He explained to me the importance of pain management and recommended me on which medication to take and to follow the precautions carefully. With follow-up appointments on my future progress to get well soon and feeling better. I recommend anyone, including my friends and relatives, to visit Metropolitan Pain Management Center.|Doctor Salahi is great Stephanie who works at the counter is the rudest person I have ever dealt with in any professional environment. Would not suggest anyone to go there her defense is ""I've been doing this 20+ years"" just terrible customer service and thinks that her experience justifies being rude and disrespectful to customers.|This is a doctor who explains and shows me my x ray and he took the time and has a very good bed side manner. He is a doctor you can talk to and understand.. Dr. Salami is an excellent doctor..|If you're looking for a good doctor don't go here. I have been  in chronic pain ever since my workman's comp insurance assigned me to Dr. Salahi. He refused to prescribe  any pain medication but always insisted I get a morphine pump. After several years  of suffering  I  agreed to getting the pump. My surgery became infected  and had to have another  surgery  which also became  infected.  At that point I had another surgery to remove the pump and was on I.V. medication for a month. Which caused additional problems  problems  requiring an additional  hospital  stay.   Upon leaving the hospital and  having an appointment with Dr  Salahi  he refused to  give me  pain medication again He was rude and cursing.  He  tried to make me feel like I was a drug addict looking for pills.  This has been the worst experience.  I would never recommend  this doctor to anyone.|Dr. Salahi and his staff are really helpful and fantastic people, they helped me more than any other doctors office has. Most other offices see just another patient, but Salahi and his staff were far more caring and treated me like a friend even in the first visit. Some people claim this is just a ""pill farm"", but after I told Dr. Salahi I wanted to do everything I could to avoid bottle medications he never once brought it up again and continued to treat me until we found something that worked. I appreciate the doctor and all of his staff for being so professional and helpful.|Been a patient of Dr. Salahi's for more than ten years, best pain management Dr. I have had in a 35 year history of back surgeries and therapy. Dr. Salahi implanted a spinal stimulator in me ( times two - battery life) which has made any reliance on RX a very manageable experience.

His entire staff is friendly, smart + helpful! Dr. Alshon takes his time with each patient, gives them his undivided attention and genuinely cares how you are doing both physically and mentally! He always has a new idea that I might try... Whether it be a new exercise, or some thing, he read on a specific food that might help! I really appreciate that. He takes his time listening to you and not rushing out the door to his next patient! Sure sometimes that means you're stuck waiting for him... And no one likes that! But if you take a second to realize that soon it will be your turn... You'll be the one to get an extra few minutes of the doctors time... You will feel better about the way!

The entire staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and does their best to get you in and out of their seamlessly!!|I had to chase Dr. Al Shawn for three months to get back into an appointment with him as they had two computer systems going and malfunctioning at the same time. They then said he no longer worked at the practice. Three days later I call to schedule with new Doctor, and they said it was a mistake and Dr. Alshon WAS still with them and it was a Misunderstanding!!!!! I then set new appointment. They canceled my appointments on multiple occasions which because it's a specialty doctor, I'd have to wait another 2 to 3 weeks to get a new appointment. Tried to give me medication's that my doctor said absolutely no to as my history was very evident that I could not take Suboxone and gabapentin for my pain. I got an appointment in Tamarac for Monday 1/30/24, they moved me to Boca Tues. Then I finally get an appointment, drive down to said appointment. I get there yesterday they said I didn't have appointment in system. The receptionists were aweful, unprofessional, uneducated, and rude! No accountability by anyone it in this practice!!! He pulled me in the office and said he was not going to do anything for me as he is done with the practice as of today. 1/31/24!!!!!!
Now have to wait until Feb 20th to be seen!!!! In addition to all of this, and refusing to continue my care plan, due to the fact that he was leaving the practice, and could care less about my future care plan!!!!!

Josephine Grella|I came to this facility with a referral from TGH after 3 day inpatient stay for chronic pain which I've been struggling with since 2015 from a fractured back in 5 places. I'm not going to even begin to list the horror stories I've seen and experienced in my quest for relief and TREATMENT which had been regulated to the ER up to this point.
While impatient, at TGH, a neurologist stated they were recommending a Laminectomy which enlarges the spinal canal to ease pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. Laminectomy is often done as part of a decompression surgery to relieve pressure I was open to albeit then the conversation or treatment plan turned to Spinal fusion. This vacillation and inability to get straight answers posed be them concerning MY SPINE I walked away from them as a result of  their inability to be straightforward. I can't begin to tell the depression that settled in after this back and forth however, I was angry, depressed with thoughts of a quick exist from the years of this unwanted excursion an agony floated within my mind.
Looking for an alternative to the screws, bolts,  mental rods or shaving  down vertebra's I regulating myself to appointments I noted Dr. Abd Alrahman Benni facility. Making an appointment filled with ambivalence and defeat, I was met by a doctor who reviewed the medical info presented to him and took the necessary steps that relieved my pain immediately with several trigger shots into the lumbar region and the correct pharmaceutical intervention needed to initiate the healing process. I found Dr. Benni attentive, straight ward and made no false promises as he laid out his suggested treatment plan. This does not exclude his staff for the most part as compassionate and understanding as they have to contend with many dealing with this chronic medical condition which is for the most part met with attributes not conducive to the healing process in general.|My PCP called his office while I was with her in her office. It should have been a Dr to Dr call! I was in a crisis situation due to my last Dr abandoning his patients right before my appt & my Dr explained that! She was calling to make sure he prescribed the meds I was on. Whoever she spoke to said ""YES he does prescribe that but she has to see the Dr first"" she had the call in speaker! I went to him and the first thing he did was try to sell me a flappy traction device, the kind that hooks up to a doorknob! I explained since I have spinal cord flattening w/spinal encroachment, Chiari malformation AND I am being seen for IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION w/power CSF leak!! I explained my neurosurgeon advised me not to do anything with my spine bc it's too fragile! & that my new patient appt with the neurologist is coming up for the IIH. I told him I won't do any kind of traction until I clear it with both of them! He didn't like that & suddenly got snippy after that and said he didn't prescribe anything over Percocets! I will never be back! Ever! He did not take my condition seriously and wanted to ignore what my neurosurgeon said!  Not a good Dr if this is the way he is! It could actually have paralyzed me! Hooking a flimsy traction device to a door knob in my small home and laying in the floor to try and do it! Yeah..NO,!!! I can't wait to tell my neurosurgeon about this one!|I have been with Dr. Benni for going on 7+ years. Dr. Benni took over my care after my neighbor gave me his outstanding care  review. He has professionally diagnosed and cared for every pain need I had. He has been also caring for my husband with his pain issues. He has given him several healing steroid shots in his back to relieve his pain. He is very caring and compassionate with our every pain need. The staff is very pleasant and care for your needs from scheduling to insurance and office comfort. It's so refreshing to be cared with friendly people. Thank you.|I have been seeing Dr. Benni for almost a year now. This is my second review I had to post because Dr. Benni and his staff are amazing. Dr. Benni has helped me so many times and has been very flexible to my needs. I am 33 and I was very healthy and in very good shape until I was almost killed in a car accident last year. Without Dr. Bennis help I am unable to walk. He has been very understanding of my situation. It is very difficult to get a doctor who is non judgmental and its very difficult to find a pharmacy that will fill pain medication which is wrong on many levels as they are not doctors. Dr. Benni and his staff seam to smooth out any issues between patient and pharmacy as im sure most people going to pain clinics know how horrible pharmacys are. Coming to the pain healing center I have no worries month to month about anything. They will truly take care of you. I cannot recommend these guys enough they are life savers!|Dr. Benni is a really good doctor. His staff is very kind. One thing I can say about him is that I don't feel pain when he gives spinal injections. His office is very clean. He really cares about his patients. Very professional.|Told me blood clots just go away? Started seeing Dr benni last year for a rare disorder called sma syndrome from blood clots in my celiac and superior mesenteric arthritis. So my small intestine is being squished by my sma artery and my celiac artery and pain meds is how I kill the pain and eat. Dr binni here had a false positive on a test or faked a result ""probably because i look 18"" and after a year I get droped with him back and he back dated my discharge so 3 days after i get my discharge papers i have a appointment, he refused to see me leaving me with out meds witch are addicting and can put you through with drowls witch can kill you from shock. He dated the discharge papers for the previous month said i had a 30 days, i got thies papers 3 days befor my appointment and now being refused. I have to find a new doctor and im back to not being able to eat again from pain in the large intestine. Dr binni is uncaring about who he is helping not showing you care in as you are some one in need of help. He Never made eye contact or talking to me in the year like I was even a person. Just staring at his tablet hanging around his neck every visit walking in typing and walking out typing never looking up and never giving you personal time to ask if the meds are even working or how you feel. He also told me blood clots just go away witch I think is very unprofessional and malpractice. Every doctor knows if blood clots just go away we would have a lot less heart attack and strokes. But this is wrong and I'm being unserved by a doctor that signed a oth to help people in need. And left to the world of opiet abuse trying to find help. you wounder why their is the problem in the first place. This man is the cause of probably hounded of deaths from street opiods because he drops the care he is pervading with out warning. All I can hope is he develops a disorder as painfully as mine so he can truly see how it is to be on the edge of of your own life. I have a fear of eating from the pain I went through and now I'm scared ill have to deal with the pain every time I eat again. And as of the comments of blood clots just go away... don't give advice on disorders because your stupidity is is quite aperant...",2024-11-01|2024-12-17|2024-09-01|2024-08-22|2023-08-16|2024-03-27|2023-08-28|2024-05-16,5|5|5|1|5|5|5|4,,,"10 a.m.|11 a.m.|9 a.m.",52.8|48.6|48.4,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended","Dr. Benni made a mistake on my prescription is there any possible way I can get it fixed before Monday Dec 1 ?","Does dr Benni have emergency call services",insurance_accepted|pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJrRiF1c3NwogRO1ZaRvm5Riw,179

The reason WHY I ask is, it is a requirement at the PM (Pain Management) doctor's office appointment that I have been, & of course, I STILL AM going to him on & off for PROBABLY, 10-15 years. AND I have ALWAYS HATED needles/syringes ALL of my ENTIRE 62+ years of my life!!
So, PLEASE, IF you &/or ANYONE else knows for a KNOWN FACT that THESE PM (Pain Management) doctors do NOT require injections/procedures? Thank you.

Sincerely, Willie L. ""Will"" Smith, III|Doc is awesome. He's direct & watches out for his patients. I've been going to him roughly 10 years since I was hit by a school bus. He listens & finds better ways to help with daily chronic pain. Injections are available here if recommended, Do it. Helps greatly|I had been seeing Melissa for years, that is until I had to move out of Florida. I was referred to her by my pain doctor for fibromyalgia and for my jaw pain. If a pain doctor referred you, you know they are good!! Melissa and her staff are amazing! I live in Alabama now and there are no neurosomatic therapists here so I miss her every day! When I visit Florida I always make an appointment. You will leave there feeling better than you have in your entire life and wonder to yourself why have I not heard of them before. I had tried chiropractors and tai chi and acupuncturists, every form of exercise there is but nothing was helpful. Then I met Melissa! She also has the Overton clinic in Wesley Chapel. If you've tried it all go see them and if you haven't tried it all stop wasting your time. You won't be sorry!|Dr. Benni is an excellent pain management physician. He is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He has come up with new ideas to help me with chronic knee pain. His staff is friendly and polite!|UPDATE: Dr. Gerguis is no longer at this practice. The head doctor writes scripts that Walmart will absolutely NOT fill. I asked why but was not told. They overbook too many appointments, and the wait can sometimes be hours. My mother has stopped going here because it's always been a big hassle since Dr. Gerguis left.

Took my mother to see Dr. Gerguis today. He's new to the practice and an excellent addition. Dr. Gerguis explained treatment options to my mother in a way that it all made sense. He was very thorough with her medications and past medical history. His assessment of her took time, and I truly believe he wants to help her have less pain. He genuinely cared. I was very impressed and have encouraged my mother to go through treatment to help alleviate her pain.|I wonder why the practice closed. Dr. Sidhom had so many medical malpractice lawsuits against him at the facility over the years. I use to be a patient there until I got kicked out for 2 dirty drug test and in the contract that you sign to become a patient at his facility, you must fail 3 drug test to get discharge from the facility. This facility is so shady. And you are no longer allowed to take xanax if you are taking pain medication in the state of Florida and if you are taking xanax, the pain doctor is now required to question why you are on xanax and if it's a 1 time thing. It doesn't matter where you live in Florida, you can not take both, you have to decide if you want to be on pain medication or xanax. It's a new law.|I admit it does take a long time to get seen.... I mean a long time!  If you are out in 2 hours you're lucky. Dr. Sidhom needs an associate like Dr. Tapia or interns who can just see patients who are there for refills.  If patients time would be respected and Dr. Sidhom would figure a way to solve the horrendous wait time, I would have given this practice 5 stars.

The good thing is that Dr. Sidhom really does care about each patient. It does take a while to establish a relationship with him. He seems aloof & unapproachable at first. He is so busy & he is a ""no nonsense"" type of person. Don't be discouraged. Just give him a chance. He cares about any pain you are experiencing in your body.  When and if you get shots, it seems like he is in his element. I've actually found it easier to speak to him during the prep time for my epidural shots that have successfully helped my pain.

I have found that if I feel Dr. Sidhom is ignoring me, I assert myself more and tell him I need him to listen and he does. He actually respect that.

I would not go to any other pain management doctor so I endure the wIt times at the office!  Thanks Dr. Sidhom and I have to exclaim that the staff in Brandon are AWESOME!  Thanks to you as well.  Without them, Doctor, your patients would not endure the office waits!|I am writing this for my mother, she will not speak bad of this Dr. because she is afraid he won't see her anymore and she isn't  well enough to find another doctor. The wait time averages to 3hours,she has been in severe pain for well over a year. On the last visit she told him she couldn't take the pain anymore. His response "" how long have you had it""?She has complained  about this pain since it started. This last visit he told her he was worried, and sent her for an M. R. I. Now we have to wait for him to read it and get back to her. I would never, ever recommend this doctor to anyone.",2025-02-17|2024-10-18|2024-10-29|2024-09-18|2022-10-20|2024-06-14|2016-05-24|2016-12-20,3|5|5|5|2|2|4|1,,,"1 p.m.|2 p.m.|12 p.m.",57|55.666666666666664|49,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointments recommended","can me buy this domain?","No it's  pain management office",pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|medication_management|diagnostic_services|physical_therapy|good_doctors|thorough_care,,,,,,,,,,ChIJp3xJAsXNwogRhnkwp20-kt4,20

Monzon carefully assessed my lower back/Sciatica situation which caused the worst pain of my life and I am 68 y/o. We opted for the minimally invasive Disc-FX, and at long last relief! After a few weeks I still have some soreness but absolutely nothing compared to the pain I was feeling prior. I am on the road to complete recovery thanks to Dr. Monzon and his very capable staff.     John Lawless|I went through many months of PT to alleviate lower back pain.  A CT scan later revealed a large herniated disc that was causing me intense pain.
I was referred to Dr Monzon who initially gave me a couple of injections that helped me tremendously.  He later recommended a procedure called Disc FX which reduces the protrusion.  This procedure was completed as an out patient a couple of weeks ago.  To date I'm virtually pain free except a little soreness from the surgery.
Dr Monzon and his staff do a great service for those, like me, that were in a great deal of pain.  I highly recommend Dr Monzon!|Dr. Monzon is the best at giving injections.  I had a sacroiliac injection this morning and it was the best I ever had.   He seriously knows what he is doing and does them very well.   I had injections at Orthopedic Associates that nearly killed me.  He is a wonderful doctor and makes you feel comfortable and welcome.  He has a very friendly and caring staff.  Dennis is my favorite of his staff.   He goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable.   I highly recommend Dr Monzon to all my family and friends.|I'll start out with a short history. I've had lower back pain/herniated bulging disk for most of my life and in the last year or so it's been getting so bad that I've been almost getting to the point of having to use the walker it was causing me so much pain to walk or do anything and I'm very active young 67 year old. I heard about Dr Monzan and I went to see him. I will start out by saying that his staff Maria, Eva and Alex are all wonderful and when I met Dr Mozan he really took the time to explain everything to me about my disc and what we can do to fix it and we decided to do a new procedure where he cleans out the herniated disk and then cauterizes it to close all the tears that cause the fluid to protrude and hit nerves giving me the intense pain. He used a procedure called DISC FX and it has been one week today and I am pain free for the first time in months!!  It is amazing and I cannot tell you how great I feel. I have to take it easy for a month make sure that the disk heals properly but after that I believe that I'm really going to be pain-free for a long long time due to this revolutionary procedure as opposed to doing major scary back surgery which would have been my other option, and one that probably would have ruined my life. Another great thing about this is if it gives me a pain-free life for two or three years and the pain does come back we can do it again although I am praying it lasts forever!! I highly recommend Dr Monzan!! If I could give him 20 stars I would and I highly recommend the DISC FX procedure for anyone looking for relief from bulging or herniated discs!! Throughout it all, Dr Monzon and his staff and the whole entire experience has been wonderful I can't thank him/them enough!!!!!|My experience with Dr. Monzon and his staff was excellent. I give my highest recommendation.
Dr. Monzon is very knowledgeable, very skillful, patient, easy to talk with, and accessible. I rate him 10 stars.|Dr. Monzon just performed a procedure  on my right knee using my own platelets for a torn meniscus. The platelets will help my body regenerate new cells and repair itself. He already did this procedure on my left knee and it was a success so I am excited to be completely pain free. What I like most about Dr. Monzon is that he encouraged this procedure instead of just prescribing narcotics like other doctors have in the past. I highly recommend Dr. Monzon and this procedure.|Dr Monzon is a very caring Doctor. I have been getting facet injections due to Dr Petrs' failed ACDF surgery. He is very compassionate in what he does he isn't there just for the money like my last Dr Petr..

****(Anyone out there who had a Dr make you give thousands of dollars ""JUST FOR A DOCTORS FEE"" as Dr PETR  did **********************

PLEASE GO TO Dr Monzon and he will make your life worth living again!|I have been going to this office for years now. Everyone there is friendly, knowledgeable, fun, and they don't rush to push you out the door. I was in the office yesterday and he spotted something I didn't realize and saved me from having to plan another doctor appointment! I am ever so grateful for everyone there.

He's an excellent doctor.  The corporation he is associated with,  Physician Partners of America, is another story.  All calls to the office are outsourced- and I mean out-of-country outsourced. NO ONE WILL EVER CALL YOU BACK OR PASS ON A MESSAGE TO YOUR DOCTOR. Many are very rude and even insulting.  I've had appointments canceled with no notification,  meaning I arrived only to learn my appointment had been canceled.  I had to drive 90 minutes away from my usual location, toward an incoming hurricane, after a car accident, to see Dr. Ellis because Physician Partners of America had canceled my appointment.  I was told I ""must have canceled it and then forgotten""- gaslighting me after all that.  I really like Dr. Ellis, but I consider leaving every time something like this happens with the office. I'm told the corporation is responsible for setting up such a poor and unprofessional business. I don't doubt it.|Wow! I am finally getting help for my pain... Dr. Ellis is very caring and wants to do his best to help me. We are going step by step to find out what is the best solution for my pain with  spinal stenosis. So far, so good!

He understands and always finds a way to relieve the pain and suffering.Thank you for all you do!|I love Dr. Ellis and all of the staff. The only thing I dislike is the waiting to see him.  The doctor is so overbooked and it causes him to run behind.  I have a pain pump and the new ARNP does not feel comfortable with making changes to the dose and doing the refills. Otherwise I would be  okay with seeing them.|Staff was very helpful. The front desk was great. The nurses and staff were great. This was my first time here .  Dr Ellis was awesome, and  talked to me and ask how he could help so that let me know that he cares|Dr. Ellis is phenomenal. The wait is long but well worth it. He is thorough, caring, polite, and informative.|The doctor listened attentively, but I would recommend incorporating questions about the patient's plan and way ahead, assessing the duration of the associated risks, and exploring alternative approaches tailored to the patient's condition.

If you are not looking for medical and want a true recovery plan. You need to make it clear to them.|Dr Ellis is a great doctor. He cares about his patients and listens to what they are experiencing.  He tells you everything that he wants to do to take care of your pain.

Recently we have also seen Michael, APRN who is also awesome. He has several outstanding staff, Stephanie was super great for years but unfortunately didn't make the move into the new practice, Gigi on front desk, Melissa MA, Edwin, and also Vanessa efficiently takes care of all my FMLA paperwork. So we highly recommend Dr. Placer if you are looking for a Pain Management and to treat your spinal issues.|Florida Spine and Pain institute is amazing, as soon as you walk through the door you are met with a wonderful greeting. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Dr Placer, Dr. Rivera and Mike are angels sent from Heaven . They listen to you and care about you. I love the way they make you feel like family from the first day you walk into their office. I recommend everyone that's in a lot of pain to come here they will take excellent care of you.|Dr. Placer is the most compassionate and knowledgeable Physician I have ever seen! I suffer from a chronic condition that is very progressive he takes his time to listen and formulate a plan that is in the best interest of the Patient! His Staff is the best, very efficient and always have a Kind word. Thank you.|I can't say enough about Dr Placer and Dr Rivera. I have been seeing Dr Placer since he first opened his office in Orlando going on his own, smartest thing he ever did! As it goes, the Orlando office grew too small and he branched out into different areas, I went way out of my way to see him in Clermont, that's how good he is. Yiyi was always there to welcome me and never showed the stress of bouncing around to all the offices and made sure she answered my questions.
When Dr Rivera joined, I became one of his main patients always trying different ways to relieve my pain from shoulder surgery to Failed back surgery, the pain 'was always there...
After months of delay due to different surgical procedures, I was finally able to test the Abbott SCS system... WOW! What a difference,' it is amazing, the staff of Rachael Lucia and Yiyi, made the surgery happen for the permanent device happen 2 weeks after the trial, I can't thank everyone there enough.|Dr Placer and his staff are absolutely wonderful! They treat you like family. Mike Dr Placers assistant is so personable and explains everything clearly.
I was always a person to stay clear of pain management centers. Dr Placers office has changed my views 100%!
I've been with Dr Placer for over 2 years now. I suffered a botched neck surgery requiring 7 neck surgeries total. I have rods in my neck blocking all views of my disc's. Dr Placer started with a series of 4 nerve blocks followed by rhizotomy. What a difference that made in my life. After 2 years I'm ready for the procedure to be repeated. i look forward to being pain free again! I can't thank Dr Placer and his staff enough for their kindness, respect and expertise!|My appointment time, was exactly when I was taken.  All the ladies in the office couldn't have been nicer.  The doctor was very professional, knowledgeable, and approachable with questions . So glad I made the 2 hour round trip to go there.|My husband had steroid shots with Dr. Rivera and my husband walked in the office fine and when he got home 2 hrs. later he was in severe pain. I called the office to see if this was normal they said some people react differently to the shots put heat & ice and they sent him muscle spasm meds. Took that for a week and it still didn't help still severe back pain. I called their office again today and told them he is still in pain can I bring him in the office for the Dr. to just look at him and they said dr. was out of town I replied can somebody else look at him and they told me they didn't have any appointments available he would have to wait to see the dr. on his scheduled date of Jan. 10. He had the injections on dec. 5th. Not pleased at all with this office.|I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I feel it's important for future patients to be informed. I saw Dr. Pacer for my second appointment at the clinic while Dr. Rivera was out. I shared my concerns about my autoimmune diseases and explained that my current treatment plan wasn't working. I also mentioned that I had been following my specialists' advice by going to the hospital during severe flare-ups.

Instead of listening, Dr. Pacer spent the majority of the appointment threatening to discharge me from the practice because I sought hospital care when my options were exhausted. He even went so far as to claim I didn't ""look"" critical enough to need the hospital that day. Ironically, I was admitted later that same day and stayed for 8 days. I'm thankful I didn't let his dismissal of my condition deter me.

His lack of professionalism, respect, and tendency to interrupt me whenever he disagreed was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope he doesn't treat other patients this way, as it's not only unprofessional but damaging to those seeking care.",2025-02-04|2024-11-20|2024-10-21|2025-02-06|2024-07-24|2024-11-26|2024-12-16|2024-09-17,5|5|5|5|5|5|1|1,,,,,"Wheelchair-accessible entrance, Wheelchair-accessible parking lot, Wheelchair-accessible washroom, Washroom, Appointment required, Appointments recommended",,,pain_management_services|surgery_services|injection_treatments|diagnostic_services|good_doctors,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ5X7wXw6P54gRwCNLU-rlE30,87

I have had many procedures done by her. Some have worked. Some haven't. That is because I have several issues stemming from car accidents. So I haven't made it easy on her. Still she continues to give me her best. Thank you Dr. Olsen I appreciate everything you have done for me and continue to do.|So I was told, the day before my procedure that I couldn't have anything to drink except water two hours before my procedure. Then I came to my appointment to get nerve blockers and they asked me when my last meal was. I said 11:30 this morning. They said they couldn't take me because I'm not supposed to eat 8 hours before the procedure. Then, when I walked out and told them that nobody told me that.|The office staff at this doctor's office is horrible.  I missed an appointment and the person I spoke to, Jen, berated me for forgetting the day that I was scheduled.    Since I was being spoken to like I was a child, I asked her, ""Have you ever made a mistake?""  She actually said NO, I  don't make mistakes.  If it was not so pathetic, it would be funny.  Doctor Olsen is a great doctor but I won't go back because the office staff is NUTS!   They have been rude to me too often.  They need to get nice, caring people to deal with the public or patients will never come back.|I have been a patient for 4 1/2 years.With Dr. Olson. It seems that since she left .Nothing is the same. I have seen different people each time I go for my  appointment for follow up and medications. Yesterday at my monthly appointment I was informed by "" yet another NEW person."", . (She was so very  rude),  that they could no longer help me. I asked why and was told that  Because I did not make an appointment with another Pain Management specialist that they suggested I might try-NOT THAT  IT WAS A REQUIREMENT -I  had thought was a decision I was to Make , Then I was informed that  they would not let me have ANY medication At All ! How is this helping me as a patient? At least, they could of provided me with some type of help. But NONE!
One  should think  twice before you make  an appointment at ""Florida Pain Management."". Hence the word ""Pain Management ""- if they are the Pain Management set of doctors, then WHY must my insurance pay for brief and rude services- AND require I go to another Pain Management?
Now, I have nothing to deal with the severe chronic and Real medical issues, not just ""joe"" of the street looking to score. My insurance company will be notified.|Absolutely horrible experience. Saw Olsen, who was very reassuring and said she needed to stabilize me in order to prepare me for tests (couldn't walk, lie down, or stand at the time). Gave me injections assisted by an ""anesthesiologist"" who may as well have given me a baby aspirin. I was screaming and she sternly told me to stop. Injections did NOTHING. When I asked to see her partner, Dr. Cordner, I was denied because I was ""established"" with HER, and she wanted me to get a CT scan......ummmm duh, didn't we just go through this? I couldn't walk, stand, lie down, or bend, and here she's telling me to get the tests that she was supposed to stabilize me for! DON'T GO.|I am currently seeing Dr. Jessica Olsen.  I believe she is an extremely competent physician.  She takes time with patients and explains and listens to what is going on.  The staff is also helpful and polite.  They are a busy office so you have to be patient.|I have been a chronic patient since an auto accident in 1984
I have been a patient of Dr. Cordners since 1996
Honestly, I tried the all the rest without much success.
I highly recommend Dr. Cordner and this Florida Pain Management staff with two locations: Sebastian and Vero Beach. This office is a five star all day long! My thought is the similar names of other local facilities have definitely been confused!
If you are looking to manage your pain without the complicating effects of surgical procedures then I encourage you to consider many of the less invasive treatment methods that are superbly administered by this fine doctor.

However his staff gives them a 1-star rating because of their bad attitudes and unprofessional behavior, especially Sara! Sara has no customer service skills and should not be dealing with the public! Sara is extremely rude and unpleasant to deal with. They should not have her dealing with patients at all! I have tried to complain to management several times about her behavior and the office manager doesn't care how patients are treated and turned a blind eye to everything that i said. Neither one of them should be in their current positions and both need to be retrained! Its sad that such a kind and caring doctor has such unpleasant people working for him.

He is amazing. I've been seeing Dr  Andrawis for approx 20 yr , before he owned his own practice, he's always been very caring and knowledgeable. He and his staff travel to multiple locations , every week, to prevent his patients from having to travel so far to see him.

Just came back to the Jacksonville area, and I'm highly delighted to find out that I can start seeing him again.|My doctor gave me a referral to this place after getting out of the hospital. When I called to make an appointment the woman who answered the phone said that they didn't get the referral. When I called my doctor they said they had sent it several days ago but she would fax it again anyway. When I called back after lunch the same lady answered and was very snotty and foul saying ""we'll call you when we get it"" she got very defensive when I said it had been sent twice and I replied that I didn't like her attitude towards a potential patient that is suffering and she just hung up the phone. I'm on hold right now with my doctor to get a referral to another place.|Dr. Andrawis is very caring and compassionate. Several of his staff members are very rude and disrespectful! They gave me fits about my disability paperwork...and we're going to charge me $50 per page for office notes! I called several times to complain to the office manager, left several messages, and never got a call back! Maybe that's what's wrong with them...under poor management! As a bonus...The very first time I saw Dr. Andrawis, he told me I was a surgery candidate, repeated my MRI, and referred me to a neurosurgeon. The girls in the office seemed very surprised that he did that! I would go back to him as long as certain staff members weren't there!|Love this Dr. He and his staff are exceptional!

I met with Dr. Stern twice, and both times he attempted to lower my current pain prescription. At that time, I was scheduled to get a triple bypass surgery and I did not think it was wise to lower my dosage due to the surgery. He insisted on lowering without consideration. I am so glad I decided to see another pain mgmt DR after my surgery. It was well needed. I do not recommend going to this practice. Stay away!|I was reffered to Dr. Stern after 3 other pain management clinics did not meet my expectations. Dr. Stern took his time with me and explained what my L4-L5 and L5-S1 showed on my MRI and didn't try to BS me. He was honest and upfront from the very beginning and explained my options.

I had a nerve block procedure done by Dr. Stern a few weeks later and had high hopes. Unfortunately, the injection did nothing to improve my back pain so we talked about plan B.

Plan B was a local injection (in office) in my L5 facet joint today (12/12/24). Unfortunately, that was not effective as well.

So why a positive review? I'm writing a positive review because Dr. Stern and the entire staff never gave me false hope, took time to plan out a treatment plan and were incredibly professional to work with. Plan C is for me to see a surgeon but I cannot thank Dr. Stern and his staff for the compassionate bedside manners and doing what they could to help me out. I highly recommend them!|My daughter has called 4 days lmsgs in emerg 2xs now  in hosp .. never got a response from anyone has no pain meds  .. so this is pain management!!!!!

There's never a long wait and they will go above and beyond to make sure you're taken care of. Simply put, these guys have their stuff together in all aspects of their practice and it's always a pleasure dealing with them!

No one asked me to write this review and I usually don't leave reviews but after having many horrible experiences at other local clinics I felt the need to share my positive experience here for anyone considering which provider to choose.|I highly recommend Dr. Stern. He explains everything in terms that are understandable and he takes all the time necessary. He is very competent and thorough with evaluation of my medical issues.
Dr. Stern and his staff are professional, caring and kind.
Highly recommend!
Brian|I was lucky enough to be told about Dr Stern for my back problems by another great doctor of mine.  After calling the office I was helped by front desk "",kind  Victoria "", who assisted with me getting in ASAP.  I later  met the assistants -who were all caring & helpful.  Once I met Dr. Stern, I was convinced that I had the right doctor. His credentials & experience are tops along with his knowledge & concern for each patient!!. He then explains your problem & gives YOU the choice(s) for what will help.
At my first visit I did wait a little longer than expected BUT once I got in and saw that he was not ""rushing"" me--- I was very content. So, if you wait to see him remember that he will/does take his time with everyone (even you)--- because he truly cares. Kudos Dr. Stern= YOU are the BEST !!!  God Bless!!!

They treat me more like a person then just another patient. For that I am very grateful and they are coming up with a good game plan to help me get back on my own two feet.|Dr Kurt and their team are absolutely fantastic. From the time you walk in the door and speak to Precious behind the counter to when you leave with a true plan on how to get your body feeling better, it's a 10/10 experience. Dr Kurt and Dr Tonya truly care about their patients and making a difference in their community. Definitely recommend calling them if you are having any type of joint or back pain.|The physical therapy just wasn't what I was looking for at Pain West.  I sat there for 50 minutes doing stretches and exercises each time while the physical therapist sat mostly on his computer and/or watched sports on both TV's in the meantime.   The physical therapists and chiropractor would get together and hang out and watch sports on 2 TV's and talk sometimes.  I can't stand watching sports.  If that's your thing, cool.  To me, it's just ugh!   It would have also be nicer to have the physical therapy tables not all together in the middle of the room...some privacy would be nice.   The exercises were somewhat helpful but this wasn't what I was looking for overall.

I liked getting TPI shots in my muscles from Katie the P.A. She really is very nice!  However, my only complaint is that I didn't like that I could only get one area done per visit on the package.  I was also never informed by anyone in this entire process in the beginning that I wouldn't be able to get TPI shots in the front of my shoulder which was one of the reasons I was there so that was disappointing.

Overall,  I personally prefer al la carte services and charge my insurance as you go.  I didn't like that I had to fork out a bunch of money for services that I didn't know if I would like or not, find out that's not what I wanted and then wait for months and several phone calls later to get a refund when I decided I didn't want to go anymore.

Also, my time is precious.  For some people with chronic medical conditions, it takes a lot of energy to go to and from appointments.  I feel like it took 2 appts to get me in and get started on a package before we could actually get to work.  I found that to be very frustrating.|This place is amazing, Everyone here is professional and caring toward the patients,my care ,I received was outstanding, everything at one place for everything,I was 100% satisfied with my treatments,I would highly recommend to anyone needing treatment|Poor customer service. Bill additional charges at end of treatment of co pays that should have been collected at each visit. PT staff just sit at computer all the time.|Extremely helpful physical therapists and a bouncy medically trained PA who delivers the initially painful shots.  The male PA's have helped with the stretching of my knees so at least I can walk with less pain.  Referred by another chiropractor, I continue to go 30 minutes twice per week.  The front desk scheduler is Precious.  She is consistent and amazing! I'm not sure if I will ever graduate - the process is becoming less painful as the joints become accustomed to more weights.|I had my first massage experience here, and it could not have gone better. They made me feel comfortable and confident. The massage was thorough and very relaxing. I would definitely recommend.|Super friendly and very professional.

She wrote down chronic pain of both shoulders and it's not chronic pain of both shoulders. Both shoulders were injured in the August 15 accident I've had right shoulder surgery left shoulder surgery, right soldier surgery and my shoulders are just fine other than the pain from the accident, so it's not chronic pain of both shoulders . The TMJ seems kind of like a joke sleep apnea I thought about but again that's expensive to be tested and I don't wanna leave my dogs home without me overnight and they're probably not gonna let two dogs in the hospital. I do have fibromyalgia. I agree with that. I don't know what spondylosis is. She didn't explain that to me. She doesn't let you talk. She does all the talking. It's like a cult. It's like an MLM. It's like a multi level marketing scheme. It's like you have to buy into the whole program or nothing at all. You can't just go to get your window fixed. You gotta buy a whole new car , when I got home and let stuff soak in I agree with a lot of the things I disagree with some things. I didn't like being told that I was setting myself up to die 3 to 4 times I'm against gabapentin. I do use the Biofreeze. I do use the lidocaine I will purchase the calcium, the vitamin D, the vitamin C them multivitamin the turmeric, and the magnesium on my October or November budget. I only use the Clinda myosin when I get a boil. I'm in physical therapy with Kris aquatic therapy would be nice, but I can't afford the co-pay every week. I can't afford Dr the psychologist, definitely going to see Dr. Johnson my psychiatrist. I'm not gonna ask Dr. Johnson for any more pills because she's already trying to increase my Latuda from 80 mg to 110 and you've got my Latuda at 60 mg on your chart which is incorrect. you've got my sleeping pill at 2 mg on my chart which is incorrect. It's 1.5 and you've got my hydrocodone down with Casey Fowler who I haven't seen for a decade and I'm getting 40 with Dr Citta .
I do already drink butter pecan Ensure. I drink Oats Overnight at night with my bedtime pills because I'm supposed to eat 300 cal you have an issue with Tobacco use that was from age 12 to age 15 and I am 55 years old now so I really don't think I'm too concerned about my tobacco usage which you brought up three times and you wouldn't let me talk to tell you anything you kept cutting me off every time I tried to speak, so that's why my report is wrong because you didn't let me correct anything you just wrote down what you thought the alcohol I already told you that I've stopped and as far as needing to go to narcotics anonymous that is bullshit because I'm a moderate user I'm not an abuser or an addict and you can talk to Dr. Lee Kimzey about any of my drug usage because I have seen him when my divorce went through and Brent, his parents tried proving I was an addict because I smoked pot two hits in the morning and two hits at night and Dr. Lee McKinzey said that I was a moderate in frequent user

Dr. Price is very good but the rest of the staff are incompetent and one lady that works the reception desk is just rude.

I was referred back to them for a second injection by a neurosurgeon's office two weeks ago.

I was seeing Dr. Carey for the longest time and she was always friendly and listened to me and answered any questions I had. She has very good bedside manners. Now I'm seeing a Dr. Stephanie from the Norfolk office and even though I was sad to not be able to see Dr. Carey anymore I feel like she left me in good hands.

But I have to completely disagree with the 1 stars. I have had a completely different experience with Doctor Birthi. My first appointment with him yes was very quick, and I was not sure how to proceed as my insurance for some reason, although very good, continued to deny much needed injections. When this continued to be an issue he took the time to get my PT records and prove I had been going for many months longer than insurance had originally required. He was kind and empathetic. The entire staff is nice and friendly. It is a busy office, but they always work around my hectic schedule to get me in.|I truly hate to give such a low rating because 99% of my experiences with this clinic have been phenomenal. My issue is solely with Dr. Birthi. To say he is rude is an understatement. He talks at you, not with you. He will not listen to a word you say and rushes through appointments as fast as he can. He'll leave you with demands to complete invasive and expensive procedures after ignoring you having said that you have either already tried them or cannot afford them. My first experience with him lasted maybe 5 minutes and I never got a word in edgewise and I have a large medical history spanning 30+ years. I left with demands to complete $10,000+ of procedures that I was not comfortable with nor able to complete but he wouldn't know that because he interrupted me 2 words into every attempt to voice my concerns. I've been with this clinic quite awhile and cannot speak highly enough about the rest of the doctors, nurses and staff I have interacted with but the fact that they all have not only agreed with my complaints and have apologized profusely for his behavior but also the fact that he cannot retain enough staff to provide consistent services says everything that you need to know. I've been lucky if I've gotten the same doctor twice in a row. They're constantly batted back and forth between their locations just to try and cover appointments until they seemingly quit which is sad because they've been some of the best doctors I've come across.|I have been coming here for the last maybe 5 to 6 months. Every time I'm here they are always so nice and helpful even when I ask the same stupid question two or three times they still answer it as well as make me feel comfortable with what's going to happen with injections or just doing check ups.

As I left that appt there was a brief oh, that UA wasn't meant for you. (Hmmmm ok) I was just there yesterday for acupuncture on my neck. I felt the doc rubbing on the back of my neck line (on my tshirt I had just literally gotten for my birthday the day before.) I asked if she had gotten ink on my shirt. She answered with no!!!!!!!

Dr Kurt and Dr Tonya truly care about their patients and making a difference in their community. Definitely recommend calling them if you are having any type of joint or back pain.|The physical therapy just wasn't what I was looking for at Pain West.  I sat there for 50 minutes doing stretches and exercises each time while the physical therapist sat mostly on his computer and/or watched sports on both TV's in the meantime.   The physical therapists and chiropractor would get together and hang out and watch sports on 2 TV's and talk sometimes.  I can't stand watching sports.  If that's your thing, cool.  To me, it's just ugh!   It would have also be nicer to have the physical therapy tables not all together in the middle of the room...some privacy would be nice.   The exercises were somewhat helpful but this wasn't what I was looking for overall.

I liked getting TPI shots in my muscles from Katie the P.A. She really is very nice!  However, my only complaint is that I didn't like that I could only get one area done per visit on the package.  I was also never informed by anyone in this entire process in the beginning that I wouldn't be able to get TPI shots in the front of my shoulder which was one of the reasons I was there so that was disappointing.

Overall,  I personally prefer al la carte services and charge my insurance as you go.  I didn't like that I had to fork out a bunch of money for services that I didn't know if I would like or not, find out that's not what I wanted and then wait for months and several phone calls later to get a refund when I decided I didn't want to go anymore.

For historical reference I sought treatment with Dr. Schultz at Regenexx in Bloomfield Colorado in 2012 receiving three Platelet Rich Plasma injections to my spine and remained symptom free for eight years.

In 2020 I injured my back during a lifting incident and symptoms returned. In 2023 I really injured my back repeatedly lifting 50 lb bags of wet soil. I was referred to Dr. Evans for a lumbar steroid injection. Following the lumbar epidural steroid injection I was chatting with the staff and noticed a brochure from Regenexx in Colorado. I told Dr. Evans my story. Lo and behold, Dr. Evans was affiliated with Dr. Schultz and he followed Regenexx protocol. My spine degeneration had advanced and there was no guarantee I would enjoy the same level of relief as in 2012. However, Dr. Evans agreed to try and help me once again with Platelet Rich Plasma injections.This time I received eight injections in my spine and SI joint in August 2024. It is the middle of October 2024 and my back pain has resolved.

I am going to do my part to strengthen my core, stretch, recondition my upper and lower body and never again lift that kind of weight.

Both my husband and I went to his office regarding our pain and they both went out of their way to make us feel like we were apart of their family. We both got injections done yesterday and Jackie held my hand the entire time. I have had a previous bad injection experience at another hospital in the Omaha area and didn't want to get another; however, I would go back again to Dr. Padron.

He explained everything that he was doing before he did it and the nursing staff kept me calm through the procedure.

Super grateful for Dr. Padron and Jackie! Thank you for what you did for my husband Kasey and I!|Went there on the 7th and my prescription couldn't be filled at Walmart...no explanation other than cannot fill prescriptions from this provider...6 voicemails and an email no reply to get it called in elsewhere... Called several times on the 8th and even went in since it said they were open on Wednesday the 8th...closed.... More voicemails no replies... Got in touch with them today and pathetic receptionist kept interrupting me and not understanding what I needed from them to get my script filled elsewhere so yes she was called what she was.... Sketchy clinic... Can't fill scripts at Walmart??? Closed when says open??? All complaints seem centered on the receptionist. .. might need a change|I see Dr Pardon in his Omaha office I'm so grateful for him. I have my HRT replacement done there him and his nurse are truly amazing, I have never been to a Dr that comes out to his lobby and interacts with his clients and is also a client himself, Biote pellets have changed my life since I had a hysterectomy at age 30 and was told by every Dr I have seen in this last 25 years that there is nothing they can do to help me with the absolutely horrible symptoms that I had. I actually can look forward to having a life not just trying to survive. Thank you so much|Dr.padron and his staff are great, doctor listens to me and how I feel. Goes out of his way to find a treatment plan. I'm not just another patient to him. Dr.p and staff go out of their way to help. Jackie and Nicole are great and always have a smile on their face. It's a family practice, they always make you feel welcomed when you visit. Highly recommend this place, I currently live in Indiana and I make the trip out there once a month to see dr.p it's definitely worth the trip. If you're in pain and need a good family doctor and inviting place to go to this is the place!|The woman who answers the phone is so rude!! Like baaad, you explain your issue for calling, she starts making something up before she even gets all your details. Raises her voice, starts to refuse service over a tiny misunderstanding and hangs up on you. Very very very unprofessional she should not have that job whatsoever.|Who closes their practice and not inform patients?
I am devastated.

Dr Padron is awesome.   His staff even better.  He's a Dr that listens and looks for solutions.   Doesn't just prescribe meds and sends you away.

Review by Sonja Does

The Total Pain Solutions by Healing Hands of Nebraska Clinic is the best for diagnosis and surgical treatment of various neurological conditions. Dr. Aguila who specializes in comprehensive peripheral nerve, reconstructive and aesthetic surgery, completed a Bilateral Occipital Nerve Surgery for Occipital Neuralgia in April 2024. After 8 years of daily migraines and occipital neuralgia pain caused by a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and now a full month after the surgery I can already say that it has made a significant and positive change in my life.

Dr. Aguila and his staff are exceptional. Their knowledgeable and compassionate support starting from my first conversation with them and throughout the scheduling and administrative process was a pleasant experience. The reception and nurse staff whose focus on patient care from pre-operation all the way through to post-operation meetings went above and beyond my expectations as they were there to ensure my well being.
Thank you Dr. Aguila, your compassion, expertise and kindness have made a real difference in my recovery. Your humorous and honest approach made a difficult time in my life more bearable and hopeful.

I also want to express my heartfelt appreciation for the post-surgical care and support you have provided. I am happy to say that the surgery was successful, furthermore your commitment to my recovery is truly admirable. I highly recommend the services of Total Pain Solutions to anyone suffering with chronic pain of any kind.|For my first surgery I have to say that I had the best surgeon!  Dr. Aguila and his staff are phenomenal! I high recommend him for any neurological surgery!! The staff made sure I was as comfortable and well taken care of in addition to the office staff at the front desk, she is always a pleasure to see when you walk in. Healing Hands has been one of the best experiences that I've had by fare. You guys put the O in outstanding. Thank you so much!!!|I can't say enough good things about Dr. Aguila and his team. My husband and I traveled all the way from Washington state to get relief for my long standing Piriformis syndrome l/sciatica. Dr. Aguila is one of the most compassionate and caring doctors I have ever met. He made the whole process such a wonderful experience, and his entire surgical staff felt like family. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving me a life without pain back and making this process so smooth.|Dr. Visits are always informative and on time.  Dr. Aguila takes time to listen to ALL your questions and concerns.  We appreciate how Dr. Aguila and his staff make us feel like a part of their family!|I was never able to see the Doctor because the admitting nurse was so horrifly rude|I appreciate the compassion and strong desire to help answer my questions.

Unless they change the way they engage with patients/customers do not come here. I was paying for a service a family member was receiving over the phone and the card was ""declined"" but actually it was pending.

Meanwhile she kept my family member there while she called her POS system company to figure out the payment. Wow! This is how they do business.  My family member had to wait for over 30 minutes with a bloody nose. Something has to change here.

I don't wait longer than 5 minutes on average (which is rare for medical appointments) even when getting back or neck injections.  I love that they do these injections in house instead of sending you to a hospital or surgery center.  The cost is much less than you would pay most anywhere else.  When they began doing them in office (with same machines as used in hospitals) my amount went from $1582 per injection to around $300 and only had to pay my $25 copay the day of service whereas surgery centers i was paying half or all upfront the day of the procedure.   The nurses are so friendly and care about you personally, not just hurrying to get to the next patient.   I have waited 2 hours in the past at hospitals to get this injections done and wasted half a day from signing in to being released.  Today I was in and out in 41 minutes and part of that was an insurance issue not the office.  If you have went here in the past and didn't like the long waits and scheduling your procedures elsewhere I suggest you give them another chance as that has improved immensely!  I have been a patient for 10 plus years thus I have been there multiple times and you are treated as an individual.|I felt so welcomed, and well cared for. The ladies took such good care of me, and I never felt rushed. The office is clean, the Doctor was professional, thorough and kind. I have hope now, because they seemed to be interested in treating the cause of my pain instead of masking it with yet another pain medication. I would definitely recommend MY PAIN DOC PC to my friends and family.|Dr Wik is who turned my life around and given me the ability to move on and accomplish more things.  In the last 2 years my healthcare from him has been outstanding.  Dr. Wik will actually listen to you when you are in pain and not write you off as a drug seeker.  He will sit with you for an hour if that's what it takes to go through your symptoms.  He is the first doctor I've seen that doesn't give you 5 minutes then rushes out the door to the next patient.  Dr. Wik and his amazing wife Kathy (a nurse) are an outstanding team.  Working together they give their patients physical and emotional care with genuine empathy.

He picked up my medical care right where we left off in another state. Doesn't over rx meds, which I love. Doesn't over do steroids, which can cause all sorts of damage and issues if used too much. He knows what he is doing and does it with care. Only issue I've ever had with them was billing issues, my insurance pays for everything and none out of my pocket but still get bills sometimes. But, they are always corrected in a quick and fashionable manner. I trust (and it is rare for me to trust drs) and highly recommend Momenta, Dr Piperis, and his staff.|I seen Dr. Piperis nurse practitioner Kristina McCutchen who I loved. How ever the billing dept. and front desk employees are not professional at all. The billing dept. doesn't know how to correctly send claims to insurance and then bills the patient. Front desk staff needs to learn HIPPA. I hear about other patients every time I went in that office.|I would NOT recommend this doctor or his office! Both the doctor and his staff accused my husband of being a drug seeker in late 2014. This was our first and only office visit after my husband was hurt at work. His office staff were talking about my husband at the front desk. They didn't say names so they were being HIPPA compliant but we could hear them talking about his case and in not so many words said he was there just to get meds. Mind you my husbands work accident was 2 weeks prior and he hadn't seen his PCP in over a year for anything other than regular check ups. NO WHERE in the provided records to them did it state he had been on pain meds for a X amount of time. Even when we were in the exam room with the doctor he gave off the vibe he didn't want to see us and did mention at one point we were just there to get drugs. We obviously sought care elsewhere.|Best pain doctor in town! Him and his staff care about your well being. Very intelligent  and the only doctor I'll trust to put a needle in my back.
Can't go wrong with this guy his bedside manner and treatment skills are definitely worth five stars.|Hands down the kindest and most thorough Doctor. Dr. Piperis diagnoses,  comes up with a plan, then treats! His bed side manner is top notch! He cares about his patient and it shows!|Was told that he would not see my daughter due to not having enough info on her medical conditions even though she was referred by her pcm doctor last month. You'd think they would be wanting to request records from her last pain doctor considering we recently moved from another state.|Dr. Piperis was very caring and really wanted to offer me some help with my pain, however that was not the case.  He did have the forsite to send me to another MD who I believe may be onthe right path to my issues. Thank you so much for your expertise and your knowledge to get me where I need to be and most of all for caring!|I suffered from lower back pain for many years. The pain at times was intense. Dr. Piperis diagnosed my condition and prescribed a course of action that alleviated my pain. This doctor and staff were  thorough and professional.
