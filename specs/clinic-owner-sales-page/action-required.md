No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

## Notes

- All Aceternity UI components are already installed
- Pricing data is hardcoded based on existing tier structure
- Testimonials use placeholder content (fictional clinic owners)
- No new environment variables needed
- No third-party services to configure

## Optional Post-Launch Actions

These are not blockers but may be desired after launch:

- [ ] **Replace placeholder testimonials** - Collect real testimonials from clinic owners who have claimed/upgraded
- [ ] **Update email templates** - Add links to `/for-clinics` page in cold outreach emails
- [ ] **Monitor analytics** - Track conversion from landing page to claim submissions
