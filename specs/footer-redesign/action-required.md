# Action Required: Footer Redesign & Placeholder Pages

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

---

## Future Considerations

While no manual action is required for the initial implementation, you may want to:

### After Implementation

- [ ] **Review placeholder content** - Replace generic placeholder text with actual company-specific content for legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, etc.)
- [ ] **Consult legal counsel** - Have a lawyer review the Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Medical Disclaimer before going live
- [ ] **Add real contact information** - Update the Contact page with actual business email, phone, and address
- [ ] **Configure contact form** - If you want the Contact page to have a working form, set up form handling (e.g., email service, form backend)

These are optional enhancements and not blockers for the initial implementation.
