# Action Required: New Scraper CSV Import Format Support

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically.

---

## Post-Implementation Notes

After implementation is complete, you may want to:

- [ ] **Re-import clinics** - Run import with new scraper CSVs to populate missing data
- [ ] **Add geocoding** - The scraper format doesn't include lat/lng coordinates. Consider adding a geocoding step to populate coordinates from addresses (this is a separate feature).
