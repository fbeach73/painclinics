# Action Required: Fix Clinic Claim Approval Process

No manual steps required for this feature.

All tasks can be implemented automatically. The fix involves code changes only - no external services, API keys, or manual configuration needed.

## Optional: Post-Implementation Verification

After implementation, you may want to manually verify:

- [ ] **Test claim approval flow** - Submit a test claim and approve it via admin dashboard to confirm the fix works
- [ ] **Check server logs** - Review Vercel logs to confirm the new logging provides useful debugging information
